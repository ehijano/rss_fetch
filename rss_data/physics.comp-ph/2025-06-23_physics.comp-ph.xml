      <title>Optimal Navigation in Microfluidics via the Optimization of a Discrete Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal path planning and control of microscopic devices navigating in fluid environments is essential for applications ranging from targeted drug delivery to environmental monitoring. These tasks are challenging due to the complexity of microdevice-flow interactions. We introduce a closed-loop control method that optimizes a discrete loss (ODIL) in terms of dynamics and path objectives. In comparison with reinforcement learning, ODIL is more robust, up to three orders faster, and excels in high-dimensional action/state spaces, making it a powerful tool for navigating complex flow environments.</description>

      <title>UGKWP and IUGKP methods for Multi-Scale Phonon Transport with Dispersion and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two novel methods for solving multi-scale phonon transport problems with dispersion and polarization effects: the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method and the implicit unified gas-kinetic particle (IUGKP) method. Both approaches are based on solving multiple groups of BGK equations at discrete frequency points. The UGKWP method constructs multiscale macroscopic fluxes at cell interfaces through the integral solution of the unsteady BGK equation and efficiently captures non-equilibrium transport using statistical particles. Its wave-particle adaptive framework ensures computational efficiency across different regimes: in the diffusive limit, it matches the cost of explicit diffusion equation solutions, while in the ballistic limit, it performs comparably to pure particle methods. The IUGKP method, specifically designed for steady-state problems, determines the particle evolution scale based on the physical mean free path. This approach enables rapid convergence at both large and small Knudsen numbers, with the latter facilitated by a newly constructed macroscopic prediction equation. Both methods incorporate an adaptive frequency-space sampling technique that maintains particle counts per cell comparable to single-frequency methods, significantly improving computational efficiency and memory usage. The accuracy and efficiency of both methods are validated through various numerical tests, including large-scale three-dimensional conduction heat transfer simulations. Results demonstrate their effectiveness in handling complex phonon transport phenomena across multiple scales.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator based Hybrid Microscale Model for Multiscale Simulation of Rate-Dependent Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of materials is influenced by a wide range of phenomena occurring across various time and length scales. To better understand the impact of microstructure on macroscopic response, multiscale modeling strategies are essential. Numerical methods, such as the $\text{FE}^2$ approach, account for micro-macro interactions to predict the global response in a concurrent manner. However, these methods are computationally intensive due to the repeated evaluations of the microscale. This challenge has led to the integration of deep learning techniques into computational homogenization frameworks to accelerate multiscale simulations. In this work, we employ neural operators to predict the microscale physics, resulting in a hybrid model that combines data-driven and physics-based approaches. This allows for physics-guided learning and provides flexibility for different materials and spatial discretizations. We apply this method to time-dependent solid mechanics problems involving viscoelastic material behavior, where the state is represented by internal variables only at the microscale. The constitutive relations of the microscale are incorporated into the model architecture and the internal variables are computed based on established physical principles. The results for homogenized stresses ($&lt;6\%$ error) show that the approach is computationally efficient ($\sim 100 \times$ faster).</description>

      <title>Great Restraining Wall in Multidimentional Collective Variable Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling methods are pivotal for exploring rare events in molecular dynamics (MD), yet face challenges in high-dimensional collective variable (CV) spaces where exhaustive sampling becomes computationally prohibitive. While techniques like metadynamics (MetaD) and path-CV enable targeted free energy surface (FES) reconstruction, they often struggle with confinement stability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and geometric flexibility. This work introduces the Great Restraining Wall (GW) method, a robust framework for efficient FES sampling within predefined CV subspaces, addressing these limitations through a novel kernel density estimation (KDE)-derived restraining potential. GW operates by constructing a bias potential that confines sampling to user defined regions ranging from multidimensional masks to 1D pathways via asymptotically half-harmonic barriers. Unlike MetaD variants requiring iterative bias deposition, GW potential is derived from a cumulative distribution function, ensuring confinement without manual hyperparameter tuning. GW provides a versatile, stable, and efficient framework for targeted FES sampling, particularly beneficial for complex biomolecular systems with intricate CV landscapes. Its integration with existing enhanced sampling protocols opens avenues for studying ligand binding, conformational transitions, and other rare events with unprecedented precision. Future work will explore GW extension to adaptive regions and machine learning-guided CV discovery.</description>

      <title>PCG-Informed Neural Solvers for High-Resolution Homogenization of Periodic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of periodic microstructures are pivotal in various engineering applications. Homogenization theory is a powerful tool for predicting these properties by averaging the behavior of complex microstructures over a representative volume element. However, traditional numerical solvers for homogenization problems can be computationally expensive, especially for high-resolution and complicated topology and geometry. Existing learning-based methods, while promising, often struggle with accuracy and generalization in such scenarios. To address these challenges, we present CGINS, a preconditioned-conjugate-gradient-solver-informed neural network for solving homogenization problems. CGINS leverages sparse and periodic 3D convolution to enable high-resolution learning while ensuring structural periodicity. It features a multi-level network architecture that facilitates effective learning across different scales and employs minimum potential energy as label-free loss functions for self-supervised learning. The integrated preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations ensure that the network provides PCG-friendly initial solutions for fast convergence and high accuracy. Additionally, CGINS imposes a global displacement constraint to ensure physical consistency, addressing a key limitation in prior methods that rely on Dirichlet anchors. Evaluated on large-scale datasets with diverse topologies and material configurations, CGINS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (relative error below 1%) and outperforms both learning-based baselines and GPU-accelerated numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers 2 times to 10 times speedups over traditional methods while maintaining physically reliable predictions at resolutions up to $512^3$.</description>

      <title>A general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics extension to mesh-less schemes in the code GIZMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profound comprehension of the evolution and phenomenology of an Active Galactic Nucleus requires an accurate exploration of the dynamics of the magnetized gaseous disk surrounding the massive black hole in the centre. Many numerical simulations have studied this environment using elaborate grid-based codes, but in recent years, new mesh-less schemes have exhibited excellent conservation properties and good accuracy at a more moderate computational cost. Still, none implement general relativistic magnetic fields, a fundamental ingredient to model an accretion disk around a massive black hole. We present here a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) scheme working within the mesh-less framework of the code \texttt{GIZMO}. We implement the hyperbolic divergence cleaning procedure, consistently extended to general relativistic effects, to keep the magnetic field divergence under safe levels. We benchmark the scheme against various relativistic magnetohydrodynamics stress tests, considering different dimensionalities and both a Minkowski or a Schwarzchild/Kerr background. To date, this is the first GRMHD scheme working in a mesh-free environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer graphics, often associated with films, games, and visual effects, has long been a powerful tool for addressing scientific challenges--from its origins in 3D visualization for medical imaging to its role in modern computational modeling and simulation. This course explores the deep and evolving relationship between computer graphics and science, highlighting past achievements, ongoing contributions, and open questions that remain. We show how core methods, such as geometric reasoning and physical modeling, provide inductive biases that help address challenges in both fields, especially in data-scarce settings. To that end, we aim to reframe graphics as a modeling language for science by bridging vocabulary gaps between the two communities. Designed for both newcomers and experts, Graphics4Science invites the graphics community to engage with science, tackle high-impact problems where graphics expertise can make a difference, and contribute to the future of scientific discovery.

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (mic.SA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the mic.SA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>

      <title>Correcting systematic errors in the likelihood optimization of underdamped Langevin models of molecular dynamics trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Kramers' pioneering work in 1940, significant efforts have been devoted to studying Langevin equations applied to physical and chemical reactions projected onto few collective variables, with particular focus on the inference of their parameters. While the inference for overdamped Langevin equations is well-established and widely applied, a notable gap remains in the literature for underdamped Langevin equations, which incorporate inertial effects and velocities. This gap arises from the challenge of accessing velocities solely through finite differences of positions, resulting in spurious correlations. In this letter, we propose an analytical correction for these correlations, specifically designed for a likelihood-maximization algorithm that exploits short, non-ergodic trajectories that can be obtained at reasonable numerical cost. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are tested across a benchmark case and a realistic system. This work paves the way for applying generalized Langevin equation inference to chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Extension of the CC($P$;$Q$) Formalism to the Electron Attachment and Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the electron attachment (EA) and ionization potential (IP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) approaches with the CC($P$;$Q$) formalism. The resulting methodologies are used to describe the electronic states of several open-shell molecules, with the goal of approximating high-level EA/IP-EOMCC energetics corresponding to a full treatment of 3-particle-2-hole (3$p$-2$h$) and 3-hole-2-particle (3$h$-2$p$) excitations on top of CC with singles and doubles (CCSD). We show that the active-orbital-based EA/IP-EOMCC CC($P$;$Q$) approaches, abbreviated as EA/IP-CC(t;3), achieve sub-millihartree accuracies relative to the parent EA-EOMCCSD(3$p$-2$h$)/IP-EOMCCSD(3$h$-2$p$) data using reduced computational effort, while improving upon their completely renormalized EA/IP-CR-EOMCC(2,3) counterparts.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Influence Functions for Resampling Data in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data -- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI), approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks, demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and Monte Carlo Analysis of Multi-Species Dynamics of agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods. Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state, after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Single-shot thermometry of simulated Bose--Einstein condensates using artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.</description>

      <title>A many-body characterization of the fundamental gap in monolayer CrI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body fixed-node and fixed-phase spin-orbit Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods are applied to accurately predict the fundamental gap of monolayer CrI$_3$ - the first experimentally-realized 2D material with intrinsic magnetism. The fundamental gap obtained, 2.9(1)~eV, agrees well with the highest peak in optical spectroscopy measurements and a previous $GW$ result. We numerically show that as expected in DMC the same value of the fundamental gap is obtained in the thermodynamic limit using both neutral promotions and the standard quasiparticle definition of the gap based on the ionization potential and electron affinity. Additional analysis of the differences between density matrices formed in different bases using configuration interaction calculations explains why a single-reference trial wave function can produce an accurate excitation. We find that accounting for electron correlation is more crucial than accounting for spin-orbit effects in determining the fundamental gap. These results highlight how DMC can be used to benchmark 2D material physics and emphasize the importance of using beyond-DFT methods for studying 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Consistent Sampling and Simulation: Molecular Dynamics with Energy-Based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both: a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Potts Models on the Sierpi\'nski Pyramid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.09604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transition of the two- and three-state quantum Potts models on the Sierpi\'nski pyramid are studied by means of a tensor network framework, the higher-order tensor renormalization group method. Critical values of the transverse magnetic field and the magnetic exponent $\beta$ are evaluated. Despite the fact that the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpi\'nski pyramid is exactly two $( = \log_2^{~} 4)$, the obtained critical properties show that the effective dimension is lower than two.</description>

      <title>A review of low-rank methods for time-dependent kinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent kinetic models are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering. The underlying integro-differential equations in these models are high-dimensional, comprised of a six--dimensional phase space, making simulations of such phenomena extremely expensive. In this article we demonstrate that in many situations, the solution to kinetics problems lives on a low dimensional manifold that can be described by a low-rank matrix or tensor approximation. We then review the recent development of so-called low-rank methods that evolve the solution on this manifold. The two classes of methods we review are the dynamical low-rank (DLR) method, which derives differential equations for the low-rank factors, and a Step-and-Truncate (SAT) approach, which projects the solution onto the low-rank representation after each time step. Thorough discussions of time integrators, tensor decompositions, and method properties such as structure preservation and computational efficiency are included. We further show examples of low-rank methods as applied to particle transport and plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Classifier: A Thermodynamic-Inspired Approach to Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Boltzmann classifier, a novel distance based probabilistic classification algorithm inspired by the Boltzmann distribution. Unlike traditional classifiers that produce hard decisions or uncalibrated probabilities, the Boltzmann classifier assigns class probabilities based on the average distance to the nearest neighbors within each class, providing interpretable, physically meaningful outputs. We evaluate the performance of the method across three application domains: molecular activity prediction, oxidation state classification of transition metal complexes, and breast cancer diagnosis. In the molecular activity task, the classifier achieved the highest accuracy in predicting active compounds against two protein targets, with strong correlations observed between the predicted probabilities and experimental pIC50 values. For metal complexes, the classifier accurately distinguished between oxidation states II and III for Fe, Mn, and Co, using only metal-ligand bond lengths extracted from crystallographic data, and demonstrated high consistency with known chemical trends. In the breast cancer dataset, the classifier achieved 97% accuracy, with low confidence predictions concentrated in inherently ambiguous cases. Across all tasks, the Boltzmann classifier performed competitively or better than standard models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. Its probabilistic outputs were found to correlate with continuous physical or biological properties, highlighting its potential utility in both classification and regression contexts. The results suggest that the Boltzmann classifier is a robust and interpretable alternative to conventional machine learning approaches, particularly in scientific domains where underlying structure property relationships are important.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of interface atomic structure of graphene on NiFe alloy substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two processes have been proposed to fabricate graphene/NiFe alloy interfaces for tunneling magnetoresistance devices. One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Electric Field and Temperature-Driven Atomistic Forming Mechanisms in TaOx/HfO2-Based ReRAMs using Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have shown unique multi-level resistive switching capabilities. However, the physical processes governing their behavior, and specifically the atomistic mechanisms of forming, remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the forming mechanism at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An extended charge equilibration scheme, based on a combination of the charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) formalism and the electrochemical dynamics with implicit degrees of freedom (EChemDID) method, is employed to model the localized effects of applied voltage. Our simulations reveal that tantalum ions exhibit the highest displacement under applied voltage, followed by hafnium ions, while oxygen ions respond only minimally. This results in the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode (anode), and the clustering of oxygen vacancies near the negative bottom electrode (cathode), where the conductive filament nucleates. This ionic segregation partially shields the bulk dielectric from the applied electric field, hindering further migration of ions in the vertical direction. We find that a minimum threshold voltage is required to initiate vacancy clustering. Filament growth proceeds through a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which are stabilized near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods rely on the positive definite property of the Euclidean metric, and do not easily extend to the indefinite Minkowski metric. In this paper, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The method we outline is conceptually simple and easily extends to alignment problems in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, the resulting student NNP achieves up to 106x speedup in inference compared to the teacher NNP, enabling significantly faster and more efficient MD simulations.</description>
