      <title>Cohomology theory for matched pairs of Leibniz algebras and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of representations for matched pairs of Leibniz algebras and develops corresponding cohomology theories, examining how cohomology groups can be applied in the context of matched pairs of Leibniz algebras. Initially, we utilize the cohomology theory to investigate infinitesimal deformations and abelian extensions of matched pairs of Leibniz algebras. Next, given an abelian extension of a matched pair of Leibniz algebras and its representation, we explore the inducibility of pairs of automorphisms, deriving both necessary and sufficient conditions for the inducibility problem. Lastly, we delve deeper into the inducibility of pairs of automorphisms using the Wells exact sequences, offering a clear framework for studying the inducibility of pairs of automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Algebraization of infinite summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebraic framework in which to study infinite sums is proposed, complementing and augmenting the usual topological tools. The framework subsumes numerous examples in the literature. It is developed using many varied examples, with a particular emphasis on infinitizing the usual group and ring axioms. Comparing these examples reveals that a few key algebraic properties play a crucial role in the behaviors of different forms of infinite summation. Special attention is given to associativity, which is particularly difficult to properly infinitize. In that context, there is an important technique called the Eilenberg-Mazer swindle that is studied and greatly generalized.
  Some special properties are singled out as potential axioms. Interactions between these potential axioms are analyzed, and numerous results explore how to impose new axioms while retaining old ones. In some cases the axioms classify or categorize a given example. Surprisingly, such axiomatizations are very concise, relying on only a handful of natural conditions.
  These investigations reveal more precisely the part that topology plays in the formation of infinite sums. Special attention is given to the methods of partial summation and unconditional summation. In the opposite direction, it is proved that from the infinite sums alone one can create a refined topology, lying between the original topology and its sequential coreflection. Another especially interesting application of these ideas is the construction of new algebraic quotient structures that retain the ability to handle infinite summation.</description>

      <title>Strongly clean ring elements that are one-sided inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding open question is whether every strongly clean ring (ring in which every element is strongly clean, i.e., is the sum of an idempotent and a unit which commute with each other) is Dedekind-finite (has the property that every element with a one-sided inverse is invertible). We give an example of a ring with two strongly clean elements that are one-sided, but not two-sided, inverses of one another, suggesting that the answer to that question may be negative.
  We then discuss possible ways of strengthening this result to give a full negative answer. We end with some brief observations on related topics, in particular, uniquely strongly clean rings.</description>

      <title>Where isomorphisms of group algebras fail to lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterexamples to the Modular Isomorphism Problem were discovered recently. These are non-isomorphic finite $2$-groups $G$ and $H$ that have isomorphic group algebras over the field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and non-isomorphic group algebras over the $2$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We show that the groups $G$ and $H$ already have non-isomorphic group algebras over the ring $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Centralizers in Hecke Algebras of Any Coxeter Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the centralizer of a parabolic subalgebra in the Hecke algebra associated with an arbitrary (possibly infinite) Coxeter group. While the center and cocenter have been extensively studied in the finite and affine cases, much less is known in the indefinite setting. We describe a basis for the centralizer, generalizing known results about the center. Our approach combines algebraic techniques with geometric tools from the Davis complex, a CAT(0)-space associated to the Coxeter group. As part of the construction, we classify finite partial conjugacy classes in infinite Coxeter groups and define a variant of the class polynomial adapted to the centralizer.</description>

      <title>Dimension two twisted graded Calabi--Yau algebras on two-vertex quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify, up to isomorphism, twisted graded Calabi--Yau algebras of dimension two on two-vertex quivers. By work of Reyes and Rogalski, such algebras may be presented as quotients of translation quivers by mesh relations. We also consider the isomorphism problem for certain families of twisted graded Calabi--Yau algebras on larger quivers.</description>
