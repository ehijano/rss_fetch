      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing quark mass $m$ all the corresponding susceptibilities must be power series in $m^2$ with finite coefficients, from which spectral constraints follow. I then use them to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $m^4/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in the fermion mass.</description>

      <title>$\bar b \bar b u d$ and $\bar b \bar b u s$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using symmetric correlation matrices with both local and scattering interpolating operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\bar b \bar b u d$ tetraquark with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$ as well as the $\bar b \bar b u s$ tetraquark with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$ using lattice QCD. We improve on existing work by including both local and scattering interpolating operators on both sides of the correlation functions and use symmetric correlation matrices. This allows not only a reliable determination of the energies of QCD-stable tetraquark ground states, but also of low-lying excited states, which are meson-meson scattering states. The latter is particularly important for future finite-volume scattering analyses. Here, we perform chiral and continuum extrapolations of just the ground-state energies, for which finite-volume effects are expected to be small. Our resulting tetraquark binding energies, $-100 \pm 10\:^{+36}_{-43}\:\:{\rm MeV}$ for $\bar b \bar b u d$ and $-30 \pm 3\:^{+11}_{-31}\:\:{\rm MeV}$ for $\bar b \bar b u s$, are consistent with other recent lattice-QCD predictions.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence an expected phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>A novel strategy to prove chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the confining phase of QCD-like theories with $N_c$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. Our proof is based on a novel strategy, called `downlifting', by which solutions of the 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for a theory with $N_f-1$ flavors are constructed from those of a theory with $N_f$ flavors, while $N_c$ is fixed. By induction, chiral symmetry breaking is proven for any $N_f\geq p_{min}$, where $p_{min}$ is the smallest prime factor of $N_c$. The proof can be extended to $N_f &lt;p_{min}$ under the additional assumption on the absence of phase transitions when quark masses are sent to infinity. Our results do not rely on ad-hoc assumptions on the spectrum of massless bound states.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking through Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories: An Exemplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our recent works revisit the proof of chiral symmetry breaking in the confining phase of four-dimensional QCD-like theories, i.e. $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors of vectorlike quarks in the fundamental representation. The analysis relies on the structure of 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for theories with same $N_c$ and different $N_f$. In this paper, we work out concrete examples with $N_c=3$ and $N_c=5$ to support and elucidate the results in the companion papers. Within the same examples, we also test some claims made in earlier works.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loops and Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear confinement with Casimir scaling of the string tension in confining gauge theories is a consequence of a certain property of the Polyakov loop related to random matrices. This mechanism does not depend on the details of the theories (neither the gauge group nor dimensions) and explains approximate Casimir scaling below string-breaking length. In this paper, we study 3d SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory numerically and find the same random-matrix behavior for rectangular Wilson loops. We conjecture that this is a universal feature of strongly coupled confining gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Incorporating $DD\pi$ effects and left-hand cuts in lattice QCD studies of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the relativistic field-theoretic three-particle finite-volume scattering formalism to describe generic $DD\pi$ systems in the charm $C=2$ sector. This includes the isospin-0 channel, in which the recently discovered doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is expected to manifest as a pole in the $DD \pi \to DD \pi$ scattering amplitude. The formalism presented here can also be applied to lattice QCD settings in which the $D^*$ is bound and, in particular, remains valid below the left-hand cut in $D D^*$ scattering, thus resolving an issue in previous analyses of lattice-determined finite-volume energies.</description>

      <title>The radiative decay of scalar glueball from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice QCD study on the radiative decay of the scalar glueball to the vector meson $\phi$ in the quenched approximation. The calculations are carried out on three gauge ensembles with different lattice spaicings, which enable us to do the continuum extrapolation. We first revisit the radiative $J/\psi$ decay into the scalar glueball $G$ and obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma(J/\psi \to \gamma G)=0.449(44)~\text{keV}$ and the branching fraction $\text{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma G) = 4.8(5)\times 10^{-3}$, which are in agreement with the previous lattice results. We then extend the similar calculation to the process $G\to \gamma \phi$ and get the partial decay width $\Gamma(G \to \gamma \phi)= 0.074(47)~\text{keV}$, which implies that the combined branching fraction of $J/\psi\to\gamma G\to \gamma\gamma\phi$ is as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$ such that this process is hardly detected by the BESIII experiment even with the large $J/\psi$ sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$. With the vector meson dominance model, the two-photon decay width of the scalar glueball is estimated to be $\Gamma(G\to\gamma\gamma)=0.53(46)~\text{eV}$, which results in a large stickiness $S(G)\sim \mathcal{O}(10^4)$ of the scalar glueball by assuming the stickiness of $f_2(1270)$ to be one.</description>

Abstract: We systematically compute the $\Lambda_b(p, s_b) \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ and $\Lambda_b(p, s_b) \to \Lambda_c(2625)^+$ form factors within the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) framework including $\mathcal{O}(1/m_c^2)$. Besides taking into account the Standard Model-like vector and axial contributions, we further determine tensor and pseudo-tensor form factors. Our work constitutes a step forward with respect to previous analyses allowing for a comprehensive study of the matrix element parametrisation stemming from the HQET formalism. Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting form factors agree well with lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) determinations stressing the need and relevance of the newly derived $1/m_c^2$ corrections.</description>

      <title>Doubly charmed pentaquark states in QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the mass spectra of doubly charmed pentaquark states in the $\Lambda _{c}^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ and $\Sigma _{c}^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ channels with $J^P=1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$ and $5/2^\pm$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. We use the parity projected sum rules to separate the contributions of negative and positive parities from the two-point correlations induced by the pentaquark interpolating currents. Our results show that the bound states of $P_{cc}$ pentaquarks may exist in the $\Lambda _cD\, (\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\Sigma _cD\, (\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\Sigma _cD^*\, (\frac{3}{2}^-)$, $\Lambda _c^*D\, (\frac{3}{2}^-)$, $\Lambda _c^*D^*\, (\frac{5}{2}^-)$ channels with negative-parity and $\Sigma _cD\, (\frac{1}{2}^+)$, $\Sigma _cD^\ast\, (\frac{3}{2}^+)$, $\Sigma _c^\ast D\, (\frac{3}{2}^+)$ channels with positive-parity, since their masses are predicted to be lower than the corresponding meson-baryon thresholds. However, they are still allowed to decay into the $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}\pi$ final states via strong interaction. The triply charged $P_{cc}^{+++}(ccuu\bar d)$ and neutral $P_{cc}^{0}(ccdd\bar u)$ in the isospin quartet would definitely be pentaquark states due to their exotic charges. We suggest searching for these characteristic doubly charmed pentaquark signals in the $P_{cc}^{+++}\to\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast) ++}\pi^+/\rho^+$, $\Sigma_c^{(\ast)++}D^{(\ast)+}$ and $P_{cc}^{0}\to\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast) +}\pi^-/\rho^-$, $\Sigma_c^{(\ast)0}D^{(\ast)0}$ decays in the near future.</description>

      <title>Investigations of $\Lambda$ states with spin-parity $\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study provides spectroscopic investigations of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ $\Lambda$ baryons with both positive and negative parities. The analysis mainly focuses on three states, namely $1P$, $2P$, and $2S$, and corresponding masses are calculated using the QCD sum rule method. To implement the method, we apply two types of interpolating currents with octet and singlet quantum numbers and compare the corresponding results with the reported masses of experimentally observed states. From the comparisons, it is extracted that the results of interpolating current with octet quantum numbers are in good agreement with the experimentally measured masses. The masses obtained with this interpolating current are $m=1513.64\pm 8.76$ MeV for $1P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$, $m'=1687.91\pm 0.31$ MeV for $2P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $\tilde{m}=1882.37 \pm 11.95$ MeV for $2S$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ and they are consistent with the experimental masses of $\Lambda(1520)$, $\Lambda(1690)$ and $\Lambda(1890)$, respectively, which confirm their spin-parity quantum numbers. Besides, we calculate the corresponding current coupling constants, which are utilized as inputs in the calculations of different form factors defining the widths of the states under study.</description>

      <title>Optimised observables and new physics prospects in the penguin-mediated decays $B_{d(s)}\to K^{(*)0}\phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the penguin-mediated decays $\bar{B}_{d(s)}\to\bar{K}^{*0}(K^{*0})\phi$ transitions. We propose a new optimised observable $L_{K^*\phi}$ from the ratio of longitudinal branching ratios of these decays, with limited hadronic uncertainties and enhanced sensitivity to New Physics. It exhibits a deviation at the $1.48\, \sigma$ level between its experimental value and its SM determination within QCD factorisation. This result can be accommodated together with the significant deviations found for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ modes in our earlier works, if New Physics affects either the QCD penguin operator $Q_4$ or the chromomagnetic dipole operator $Q_{8g}$ for both $b\to d$ and $b\to s$ transitions. The allowed range for the Wilson coefficients $C_{4s,8gs}$ is narrower compared to $C_{4d,8gd}$ since the $b\to s$ transition $\bar{B}_d\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$ is in better agreement with the SM. If we add the measured branching ratio for the $\bar{B}_{d}\to \bar{K}^{0}\phi$ to our analysis, the simultaneous explanation of all the experimental data for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and the $K^*(\bar{K}^{(*)})\phi$ channels in terms of New Physics in $C_{4d,s}$ or $C_{8gd,s}$ operators only becomes very constrained. This set of observables can be explained more easily if we assume New Physics either in $(C_{4f},C_{6f})$ or $(C_{6f},C_{8gf})$ in both $f=d,s$. This should provide a strong incentive for the LHCb experiment to perform a measurement of the branching ratios of $\bar{B}_{d}\to\bar{K}^{(*)0}\phi$ and an improved measurement for the branching ratio of $\bar{B}_s\to K^{*0}\phi$.</description>
