      <title>Business and Regulatory Responses to Artificial Intelligence: Dynamic Regulation, Innovation Ecosystems and the Strategic Management of Disruptive Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and then implementing an effective response to disruptive new AI technologies is enormously challenging for any business looking to integrate AI into their operations, as well as regulators looking to leverage AI-related innovation as a mechanism for achieving regional economic growth. These business and regulatory challenges are particularly significant given the broad reach of AI, as well as the multiple uncertainties surrounding such technologies and their future development and effects. This article identifies two promising strategies for meeting the AI challenge, focusing on the example of Fintech. First, dynamic regulation, in the form of regulatory sandboxes and other regulatory approaches that aim to provide a space for responsible AI-related innovation. An empirical study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that jurisdictions that adopt a more proactive approach to Fintech regulation can attract greater investment. The second strategy relates to so-called innovation ecosystems. It is argued that such ecosystems are most effective when they afford opportunities for creative partnerships between well-established corporations and AI-focused startups and that this aspect of a successful innovation ecosystem is often overlooked in the existing discussion. The article suggests that these two strategies are interconnected, in that greater investment is an important element in both fostering and signaling a well-functioning innovation ecosystem and that a well-functioning ecosystem will, in turn, attract more funding. The resulting synergies between these strategies can, therefore, provide a jurisdiction with a competitive edge in becoming a regional hub for AI-related activity.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. We design an integrated bio-economic agent-based model, informed by historical data from the French agricultural sector, to project future biodiversity trends and evaluate policy interventions. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Redefining Urban Centrality: Integrating Economic Complexity Indices into Central Place Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a metric designed to measure urban structures through the economic complexity lens, building on the foundational theories of urban spatial structure, the Central Place Theory (CPT) (Christaller, 1933). Despite the significant contribution in the field of urban studies and geography, CPT has limited in suggesting an index that captures its key ideas. By analyzing various urban big data of Seoul, we demonstrate that PCI and ECI effectively identify the key ideas of CPT, capturing the spatial structure of a city that associated with the distribution of economic activities, infrastructure, and market orientation in line with the CPT. These metrics for urban centrality offer a modern approach to understanding the Central Place Theory and tool for urban planning and regional economic strategies without privacy issues.</description>

      <title>"How lonely are you?" The role of social contacts and farm characteristics in farmers' self-reported feelings of loneliness, and why it matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loneliness and social isolation among farmers are growing public health concerns. The contributing factors are manifold, and some of them are linked to structural change in agriculture, for instance because of higher workloads, rural depopulation, or reduced opportunities for collaboration. Our work explores the interconnections between loneliness, social contacts, and structural factors in agriculture based on a survey of 110 farm managers in the mountain region of Entlebuch, Switzerland combined with agricultural census data. We use path analysis, in which loneliness is the main outcome, and social contacts are an explanatory and explained variable. We find that 3% of respondents report that they feel lonely frequently or very frequently, and the rest sometimes (20%), rarely (40%) or never (38%). Managers with higher workloads report feeling lonely more frequently, and this relationship is direct, as well as indirect because of less frequent social contacts. However, physical isolation is not a significant predictor of loneliness. Moreover, short food supply chains correlate with less frequent loneliness feelings. Our study sheds light on the effects that structural change can have on the social fabric of rural areas.</description>

      <title>Emission Reduction in Urban Environments by Replacing Conventional City Buses with Electric Bus Technology: A Case Study of Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global transportation industry has become one of the main contributors to air pollution. Consequently, electric buses and green transportation are gaining popularity as crucial steps to reduce emission concerns. Many developed countries have already adopted the concept of Battery Electric Buses (BEBs), while the developing ones are just starting with it. However, BEB fleets have advantages, such as lower fuel, higher efficiency, lower maintenance, and energy security. Yet, several obstacles must be overcome to support the mass deployment of BEBs. These incorporate forthright expense charges, arranging loads, BEB reach, and newness to BEB innovation. Stakeholders like policymakers, private company owners, and government leaders have a lot to consider before introducing BEBs at any level in Pakistan. As a result, to operate an electric bus system profitably, it is crucial to develop a proper electric bus network and fleet, especially for bus operators who need to buy enough electric buses at the appropriate time. As a result, this paper aims to investigate if operating an electric bus could be an alternative to regular bus operations. The proposed methodology develops modeling software to cater to various scenarios to determine a proper-designed electric bus operating system in terms of the electric bus route, service frequency, and quantity. This research work simulates and financially analyses an operating Public Transport Infrastructure with a proposed Green Solution. The results show that regardless of the high upfront costs of BEB infrastructure, it becomes profitable in 6-7 years, resulting in a decreased Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of approximately 30% of its counterpart. The study also provides a clear policy pathway to help stakeholders make informed decisions related to the electrification of public transport in Pakistan.</description>

      <title>Temptation: Immediacy and certainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is an option especially tempting when it is both immediate and certain? I test the effect of risk on the present-bias factor given quasi-hyperbolic discounting. In my experiment, workers allocate about thirty to fifty minutes of real-effort tasks between two weeks. I study dynamic consistency by comparing choices made two days in advance of the workday with choices made when work is imminent. My novel design permits estimation of present-bias using a decision with a consequence that is both immediate and certain. I find greater present-bias when the consequence is certain. This finding has implications for any economic decision involving a present-biased individual, including labor contracting and consumer good pricing. Finally I offer a methodological remedy for experimental economists.</description>

      <title>Security Issuance, Institutional Investors and Quid Pro Quo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16643v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Securities issuance through intermediaries is subject to agency problems and informational frictions. We examine these effects using SPAC data. We identify ``premium'' investors whose participation is linked to lower liquidation risk, higher returns, and lower redemption rates, consistent with both informational rents and agency frictions. In contrast, ``non-premium'' investors engage in non-agency quid pro quo relationships. Specifically, they receive high returns from an intermediary (quid) in exchange for a tacit agreement to participate in weaker future deals (quo). These relationships serve as insurance for issuers and intermediaries, enabling more issuers to access markets.</description>
