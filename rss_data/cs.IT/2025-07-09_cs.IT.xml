      <title>Lower Bounds for Error Coefficients of Griesmer Optimal Linear Codes via Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The error coefficient of a linear code is defined as the number of minimum-weight codewords. In an additive white Gaussian noise channel, optimal linear codes with the smallest error coefficients achieve the best possible asymptotic frame error rate (AFER) among all optimal linear codes under maximum likelihood decoding. Such codes are referred to as AFER-optimal linear codes.
  The Griesmer bound is essential for determining the optimality of linear codes. However, establishing tight lower bounds on the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes is challenging, and the linear programming bound often performs inadequately. In this paper, we propose several iterative lower bounds for the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes. Specifically, for binary linear codes, our bounds are tight in most cases when the dimension does not exceed $5$. To evaluate the performance of our bounds when they are not tight, we also determine the parameters of the remaining 5-dimensional AFER-optimal linear codes. Our final comparison demonstrates that even when our bounds are not tight, they remain very close to the actual values, with a gap of less than or equal to $2$.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Mapping, Localization, and Beam Management via Multi-Modal SLAM in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for sixth-generation (6G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, enabling environmental awareness and precise user equipment (UE) positioning. While cooperative multi-user SLAM has demonstrated potential in leveraging distributed sensing, its application within multi-modal ISAC systems remains limited, particularly in terms of theoretical modeling and communication-layer integration. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal SLAM framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions. First, a Bayesian estimation framework is developed for cooperative multi-user SLAM, along with a two-stage algorithm for robust radio map construction under dynamic and heterogeneous sensing conditions. Second, a multi-modal localization strategy is introduced, fusing SLAM results with camera-based multi-object tracking and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data via an error-aware model, significantly improving UE localization in multi-user scenarios. Third, a sensing-aided beam management scheme is proposed, utilizing global radio maps and localization data to generate UE-specific prior information for beam selection, thereby reducing inter-user interference and enhancing downlink spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system improves radio map accuracy by up to 60%, enhances localization accuracy by 37.5%, and significantly outperforms traditional methods in both indoor and outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>Text-Guided Token Communication for Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of 6G networks and proliferation of visual applications, efficient image transmission under adverse channel conditions is critical. We present a text-guided token communication system leveraging pre-trained foundation models for wireless image transmission with low bandwidth. Our approach converts images to discrete tokens, applies 5G NR polar coding, and employs text-guided token prediction for reconstruction. Evaluations on ImageNet show our method outperforms Deep Source Channel Coding with Attention Modules (ADJSCC) in perceptual quality and semantic preservation at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) above 0 dB while mitigating the cliff effect at lower SNRs. Our system requires no scenario-specific retraining and exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization, establishing a new paradigm for efficient image transmission aligned with human perceptual priorities.</description>

      <title>Does Movable Antenna Present A Dual-edged Nature? From the Perspective of Physical Layer Security: A Joint Design of Fixed-position Antenna and Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional artificial noise (AN)-aided physical-layer security systems, fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays exhibit inherent vulnerability to coverage gaps due to their static spatial configuration. Adversarial eavesdroppers can strategically exploit their mobility to infiltrate these spatial nulls of AN radiation patterns, thereby evading interference suppression and successfully intercepting the confidential communication. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate a hybrid antenna deployment framework integrating FPA arrays and movable antenna (MA) arrays (denoted by FMA co-design) to address the security performance in dynamic wireless environments, based on the fact that MA arrays enable channel reconfiguration through localized antenna repositioning, achieving more higher spatial degree of freedom (DoF). Enabled by FMA co-design framework, FPA arrays ensure baseline connectivity for legitimate links while MA arrays function as dynamic security enhancers, replacing conventional static AN generation. Furthermore, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem of the secrecy rate maximization through jointly optimizing MA positioning, FPA beamforming, and MA beamforming under practical constraints. the solution employs a dual-algorithm approach: Nesterov momentum-based projected gradient ascent (NMPGA) accelerates convergence in continuous position optimization, while alternating optimization (AO) handles coupled beamforming design. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed FMA co-design framework achieves significant secrecy performance gains over individual optimization benchmarks, yielding 42.34% and 9.12% improvements in secrecy rate compared to isolated FPA for AN generation and MA for confidential information baselines, respectively.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Communication Through Exploiting RIS, SSK, and CIM for Improved Reliability and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel communication system model that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), spatial shift keying (SSK), and code index modulation (CIM) based on Hadamard coding called RIS based transmit SSK-CIM (RIS-CIM-TSSK). By leveraging RIS, the system adapts rapidly to dynamic environments, enhancing error rates and overall reliability. SSK facilitates the transmission of additional passive information while eliminating the need for multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, thereby reducing complexity. CIM enhances passive information transmission through frequency domain spreading, which may increase signal obfuscation. This proposed scheme not only improves energy efficiency but also offers a robust solution for reliable communication in modern wireless networks, paving the way for smarter and more adaptable implementations. We consider a suboptimal, low-complexity detector for the proposed scheme and also address the blind case for phase adjustment of the RIS. Finally, we present the simulation results for the proposed system model across various configurations, including different numbers of receive and transmit antennas, varying reflecting elements of the RIS, and different code lengths.</description>

      <title>An Effective Equivalence Model of Analyzing PLS of Multiple Eavesdroppers Facing Low-altitude Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low-altitude wireless communications, the increased complexity of wireless channels and the uncertainty of eavesdroppers (Eves)--caused by diverse altitudes, speeds, and obstacles--pose significant challenges to physical layer security (PLS) technologies based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), particularly in terms of beamforming capabilities and spatial efficiency. In contrast, movable antennas (MAs) offer a flexible solution by enabling channel reconstruction through antenna movement, effectively compensating for the limitations of FPAs. In this paper, we aim to derive a closed-form expression for the secrecy rate, a key metric in PLS, which is often unattainable in current studies due to the uncertainty of Eves. We construct an equivalent model that leverages the reconfigurable nature of MAs, equating the secrecy rates obtained by multiple Eves with single FPAs to those achieved by a single virtual Eve equipped with an MA array. To minimize the gap between these two types of secrecy rates, we formulate and solve an optimization problem by jointly designing the equivalent distance between the transmitter and the virtual Eve} and the antenna positions of MAs at the virtual Eve. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed equivalent model, offering a new perspective for PLS strategies. This work provides significant insights for network designers on how system parameters affect PLS performance.</description>

Abstract: A novel original procedure of encryption/decryption based on the polyadic algebraic structures and on signal processing methods is proposed. First, we use signals with integer amplitudes to send information. Then we use polyadic techniques to transfer the plaintext into series of special integers. The receiver restores the plaintext using special rules and systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Tight Bound for Quantum Unitary Time-Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound $\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Beating the Best Constant Rebalancing Portfolio in Long-Term Investment: A Generalization of the Kelly Criterion and Universal Learning Algorithm for Markets with Serial Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms generate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared to the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being consistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be improved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in feature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial dependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar effects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are commonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an algorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data, without any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that eventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing portfolio.
  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets' returns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as an independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such a stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary processes fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a strategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies, matching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly criterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the theoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as long as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the generalized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms the broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving efficient and cost-effective transmit beampattern control for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems is a significant challenge. This paper addresses this by proposing a dual-function radar communication (DFRC) transmitter based on a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) illuminated by a limited number of active sources. We formulate and solve the joint design of source waveforms and RIS phase shifts to match a desired space-frequency radiation pattern, and we evaluate the resulting ISAC system's performance in terms of radar detection probability and data transmission rate. Numerical results demonstrate the promising capabilities of this RIS-enabled transmitter for ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>Bounding quantum uncommon information with quantum neural estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-NOMA Systems Secrecy in the Presence of Active Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are highly efficient. Massive MIMO systems are inherently resistant to passive attackers (eavesdroppers), thanks to transmissions directed to the desired users. However, active attackers can transmit a combination of legitimate user pilot signals during the channel estimation phase. This way they can mislead the base station (BS) to rotate the transmission in their direction, and allow them to eavesdrop during the downlink data transmission phase. In this paper, we analyse this vulnerability in an improved system model and stronger adversary assumptions, and investigate how physical layer security can mitigate such attacks and ensure secure (confidential) communication. We derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity, using stochastic geometry tools when the number of antennas in the BSs tends to infinity. We adapt the result to evaluate the secrecy performance in massive orthogonal multiple access (OMA). We find that appropriate power allocation allows NOMA to outperform OMA in terms of ergodic secrecy rate and SOP.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless communications has demonstrated inherent robustness against wireless channel distortions. Most existing works empirically leverage this robustness to yield considerable performance gains through AI architectural designs. However, there is a lack of direct theoretical analysis of this robustness and its potential to enhance communication efficiency, which restricts the full exploitation of these advantages. In this paper, we adopt an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the robustness in wireless distributed learning by deriving an upper bound on the task performance loss due to imperfect wireless channels. Utilizing this insight, we define task outage probability and characterize the maximum transmission rate under task accuracy guarantees, referred to as the task-aware $\epsilon$-capacity resulting from the robustness. To achieve the utility of the theoretical results in practical settings, we present an efficient algorithm for the approximation of the upper bound. Subsequently, we devise a robust training framework that optimizes the trade-off between robustness and task accuracy, enhancing the robustness against channel distortions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed upper bound and task-aware $\epsilon$-capacity and demonstrate that the proposed robust training framework achieves high robustness, thus ensuring a high transmission rate while maintaining inference performance.</description>

      <title>Relative Phase Equivariant Deep Neural Systems for Physical Layer Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04730</link>

Abstract: In the era of telecommunications, the increasing demand for complex and specialized communication systems has led to a focus on improving physical layer communications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution avenue for doing so. Deep neural receivers have already shown significant promise in improving the performance of communications systems. However, a major challenge lies in developing deep neural receivers that match the energy efficiency and speed of traditional receivers. This work investigates the incorporation of inductive biases in the physical layer using group-equivariant deep learning to improve the parameter efficiency of deep neural receivers. We do so by constructing a deep neural receiver that is equivariant with respect to the phase of arrival. We show that the inclusion of relative phase equivariance significantly reduces the error rate of deep neural receivers at similar model sizes. Thus, we show the potential of group-equivariant deep learning in the domain of physical layer communications.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with Cyclic User Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04564v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is motivated by federated learning (FL) where a cloud server aims to compute an averaged model (i.e., weights of deep neural networks) of the locally-trained models of numerous clients, while adhering to data security requirements. Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this concept to a three-layer hierarchical network, where clustered users communicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated with only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster users to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we consider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to $B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient aggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by gradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in distributed computing-along with a highly non-trivial security key design. We also derive novel converse bounds on the minimum achievable communication and key rates using information-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Selective Modeling and Analysis for OFDM-Integrated Wideband Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates the integration of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to ensure their compatibility and to explore the frequency-selective behavior inherent to PASS. First, an end-to-end channel model for OFDM PASS is proposed based on electromagnetic-compliant modeling of waveguides and coupled-mode theory, which includes frequency-dependent waveguide attenuation, dispersion and antenna coupling effect. Furthermore, a critical dependence of the OFDM cyclic prefix (CP) overhead on the proximity of the operating frequency to the waveguide cutoff is revealed. Moreover, the phase misalignment effect across subcarriers in OFDM PASS is derived for an approximate pinching antenna location strategy based on path loss minimization, which reveals the phase misalignment is exacerbated for wider bandwidths and larger array size. Numerical results show that: 1) frequency-selective effects in OFDM PASS lead to substantial variations in subcarrier achievable rates, highlighting the necessity of operating above the waveguide cutoff frequency for effective communications; 2) waveguide dispersion mandates considerable CP overhead when operating near the cutoff frequency, severely impacting the spectral efficiency of OFDM PASS; and 3) the gentle linear waveguide attenuation in a practical PASS significantly more advantageous than the severe logarithmic path loss characteristic of fixed-location antennas.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna-Enhanced Physical-Layer Service Integration: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have drawn increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability to create favorable channel conditions via local movement within a confined region. In this letter, we investigate its application in physical-layer service integration (PHY-SI), where a multi-MA base station (BS) simultaneously transmits both confidential and multicast messages to two users. The multicast message is intended for both users, while the confidential message is intended only for one user and must remain perfectly secure from the other. Our goal is to jointly optimize the secrecy and multicast beamforming, as well as the MAs' positions at the BS to maximize the secrecy rate for one user while satisfying the multicast rate requirement for both users. To gain insights, we first conduct performance analysis of this MA-enhanced PHY-SI system in two special cases, revealing its unique characteristics compared to conventional PHY-SI with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). To address the secrecy rate maximization problem, we propose a two-layer optimization framework that integrates the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a discrete sampling algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that MAs can greatly enhance the achievable secrecy rate region for PHY-SI compared to FPAs.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Speculative Decoding via Sequential Approximate Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a recently proposed technique for faster inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing sequential approximate verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This reduces the number of calls to the larger LLM, achieving further speedups and lower computation cost. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency.</description>
