      <title>Fractional Artificial Neural Networks for Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a method to solve initial value problems for fractional growth models, such as generalizations of the exponential and logistic with periodic harvesting models. Using a discretization of the Caputo derivative we propose a fractional artificial neural network, which is implemented in the statistical software R. Moreover, we show examples where the analytical solutions and the approximation of the artificial neural network are compared.</description>

      <title>Jump-diffusion models of parametric volume-price distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework to model the stochastic evolution of volume-price distribution from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) equities. The empirical distributions are sampled every 10 minutes over 976 trading days, and fitted to different models, namely Gamma, Inverse Gamma, Weibull, and Log-Normal distributions. Each of these models is parameterized by a shape parameter, $\phi$, and a scale parameter, $\theta$, which are detrended from their daily average behavior. The time series of the detrended parameters is analyzed using adaptive binning and regression-based extraction of the Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients, up to their sixth order, enabling to classification of its intrinsic dynamics. We show that (i) $\phi$ is well described as a pure diffusion with a linear mean regression for the Gamma, Inverse Gamma, and Weibull models, while $\theta$ shows dominant jump-diffusion dynamics, with an elevated fourth- and sixth-order moment contributions; (ii) the log-normal model shows however the opposite: $\theta$ is predominantly diffusive, with $\phi$ showing weak jump signatures; (iii) global moment inversion yields jump rates and amplitudes that account for a large share of total variance for $\theta$, confirming that rare discontinuities dominate volatility.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Black Box of Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computers, based on large recurrent neural networks with fixed random connections, are known to perform a wide range of information processing tasks. However, the nature of data transformations within the reservoir, the interplay of input matrix, reservoir, and readout layer, as well as the effect of varying design parameters remain poorly understood. In this study, we shift the focus from performance maximization to systematic simplification, aiming to identify the minimal computational ingredients required for different model tasks. We examine how many neurons, how much nonlinearity, and which connective structure is necessary and sufficient to perform certain tasks, considering also neurons with non-sigmoidal activation functions and networks with non-random connectivity. Surprisingly, we find non-trivial cases where the readout layer performs the bulk of the computation, with the reservoir merely providing weak nonlinearity and memory. Furthermore, design aspects often considered secondary, such as the structure of the input matrix, the steepness of activation functions, or the precise input/output timing, emerge as critical determinants of system performance in certain tasks.</description>

      <title>TDSNNs: Competitive Topographic Deep Spiking Neural Networks for Visual Cortex Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this, we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy, compared to a 3% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep learning models.</description>

      <title>The Cooperative Network Architecture: Learning Structured Networks as Representation of Sensory Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05650v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and generalization to out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.</description>

      <title>MonoKAN: Certified Monotonic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have significantly advanced various fields by effectively recognizing patterns and solving complex problems. Despite these advancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet interpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model predictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified by partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in the literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face difficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial monotonicity. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture, based on learnable activation functions parametrized as splines, has been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to MLPs. Building on this, we introduce a novel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture and achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability. To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output. Our experiments demonstrate that MonoKAN not only enhances interpretability but also improves predictive performance across the majority of benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Attractor Analysis of High-Capacity Kernel Logistic Regression Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods such as Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, but the principles governing their performance and stability remain largely uncharacterized. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the attractor landscape in KLR-trained networks to establish a solid foundation for their design and application. Through extensive, statistically validated simulations, we address critical questions of generality, scalability, and robustness. Our comparative analysis reveals that KLR and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) exhibit similarly high storage capacities and clean attractor landscapes, suggesting this is a general property of kernel regression methods, though KRR is computationally much faster. We uncover a non-trivial, scale-dependent scaling law for the kernel width ($\gamma$), demonstrating that optimal capacity requires $\gamma$ to be scaled such that $\gamma \times N$ increases with network size $N$. This implies that larger networks necessitate more localized kernels -- where each pattern's influence is more spatially confined -- to manage inter-pattern interference. Under this optimized scaling, we provide definitive evidence that the storage capacity scales linearly with network size ($P \propto N$). Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that performance is remarkably robust to the choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Collectively, these findings provide a clear set of empirical principles for designing high-capacity, robust associative memories and clarify the mechanisms that enable kernel methods to overcome the classical limitations of Hopfield-type models.</description>

      <title>Brain-Like Processing Pathways Form in Models With Heterogeneous Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain is made up of a vast set of heterogeneous regions that dynamically organize into pathways as a function of task demands. Examples of such pathways can be found in the interactions between cortical and subcortical networks during learning, or in sub-networks specializing for task characteristics such as difficulty or modality. Despite the large role these pathways play in cognition, the mechanisms through which brain regions organize into pathways remain unclear. In this work, we use an extension of the Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts architecture to show that heterogeneous regions do not form processing pathways by themselves, implying that the brain likely implements specific constraints which result in the reliable formation of pathways. We identify three biologically relevant inductive biases that encourage pathway formation: a routing cost imposed on the use of more complex regions, a scaling factor that reduces this cost when task performance is low, and randomized expert dropout. When comparing our resulting \textit{Mixture-of-Pathways} model with the brain, we observe that the artificial pathways in our model match how the brain uses cortical and subcortical systems to learn and solve tasks of varying difficulty. In summary, we introduce a novel framework for investigating how the brain forms task-specific pathways through inductive biases, and the effects these biases have on the behavior of Mixture-of-Experts models.</description>
