      <title>Structural investigation of the quasi-one-dimensional topological insulator Bi$_4$I$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bismuth-halide Bi$_4$I$_4$ undergoes a structural transition around $T_P\sim 300$K, which separates a high-temperature $\beta$ phase ($T&gt;T_P$) from a low-temperature $\alpha$ phase ($T&lt;T_P$). $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases are suggested to host electronic band structures with distinct topological classifications. Rapid quenching was reported to stabilize a metastable $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ at $T&lt;T_P$, making possible a comparative study of the physical properties of the two phases in the same low-temperature range. In this work, we present a structural investigation of the Bi$_4$I$_4$ before and after quenching together with electrical resistivity measurements. We found that rapid cooling does not consistently lead to a metastable $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$, and a quick transition to $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ is observed. As a result, the comparison of putative signatures of different topologies attributed to a specific structural phase should be carefully considered. The observed phase instability is accompanied by an increase in iodine vacancies and by a change in the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, pointing to native defects as a possible origin of our finding. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the scenario that iodine vacancies, together with bismuth antisites and interstitials, are among the defects that are more likely to occur in Bi$_4$I$_4$ during the growth.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction collapse driven by non-Hermitian disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the measurement problem, we propose to model the interaction between a quantum particle and an "apparatus" through a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian term. We simulate the time evolution of a normalized quantum state split into two spin components (via a Stern-Gerlach experiment) and that undergoes a wave-function collapse driven by a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian. We further analyze how the strength and other parameters of the non-Hermitian perturbation influence the time-to-collapse of the wave function obtained under a Schr\"{o}dinger-type evolution. We finally discuss a thought experiment where manipulation of the apparatus could challenge standard quantum mechanics predictions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of depth-dose curves and water equivalent ratios of energetic proton beams in cortical bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have determined the depth-dose curve, the penetration range, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), for proton beams of clinical energies in cortical bone, by means of a detailed and accurate simulation that combines molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. The fundamental input quantities (stopping power and energy loss straggling) for the simulation were obtained from a reliable electronic excitation spectrum of the condensed-phase target, which takes into account the organic and mineral phases that form it. Our simulations with these inputs, that are in excellent agreement with the scarce data available for a cortical bone target, deviate from simulations performed using other stopping quantities, such as those provided in the widely used ICRU Report 49. The results of this work emphasize the importance of an accurate determination of the stopping quantities of cortical bone in order to advance towards the millimetric precision for the proton penetration ranges and deposited dose needed in radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Influence of Entropy Changes on First Passage Time in the Thermodynamics of trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07398v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For thermodynamics of trajectories, an ensemble containing dynamical activity and first-passage time (FPT) random variables is considered. The dependence of the average FPT on the total non-negative change in entropy is obtained. The same dependencies obtained for dynamic activity, dispersion of dynamic activity and FPT, as well as for the correlation of dynamic activity and FPT. Application of the obtained results to model systems makes it possible to obtain dependences of entropy changes containing a stationary nonequilibrium state and equilibrium states. To relate changes in entropy to the conjugate parameter of the FPT, three models of distribution functions are used, which are applied to classical two-level and three-level systems, as well as to a quantum two-level system.</description>
