      <title>Faster Algorithms for Structured Matrix Multiplication via Flip Graph Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit low-rank bilinear non-commutative schemes for multiplying structured $n \times n$ matrices with $2 \leq n \leq 5$, which serve as building blocks for recursive algorithms with improved multiplicative factors in asymptotic complexity. Our schemes are discovered over $\mathbb{F}_2$ or $\mathbb{F}_3$ and lifted to $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Q}$. Using a flip graph search over tensor decompositions, we derive schemes for general, upper-triangular, lower-triangular, symmetric, and skew-symmetric inputs, as well as products of a structured matrix with its transpose. In particular, we obtain $4 \times 4$ rank-34 schemes: (i) multiplying a general matrix by its transpose using 10 recursive calls, improving the factor from 26/41 (0.634) to 8/13 (0.615); and (ii) multiplying an upper-triangular matrix by a general matrix using 12 recursive calls, improving the factor from 8/13 (0.615) to 22/37 (0.595). Additionally, using $\mathbb{F}_3$ flip graphs, we discover schemes over $\mathbb{Q}$ that fundamentally require the inverse of 2, including a $2 \times 2$ symmetric-symmetric multiplication of rank 5 and a $3 \times 3$ skew-symmetric-general multiplication of rank 14 (improving upon AlphaTensor's 15).</description>

      <title>Fast polynomial computations with space constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The works presented in this habilitation concern the algorithmics of polynomials. This is a central topic in computer algebra, with numerous applications both within and outside the field - cryptography, error-correcting codes, etc. For many problems, extremely efficient algorithms have been developed since the 1960s. Here, we are interested in how this efficiency is affected when space constraints are introduced.
  The first part focuses on the time-space complexity of fundamental polynomial computations - multiplication, division, interpolation, ... While naive algorithms typically have constant space complexity, fast algorithms generally require linear space. We develop algorithms that are both time- and space-efficient. This leads us to discuss and refine definitions of space complexity for function computation.
  In the second part, the space constraints are put on the inputs and outputs. Algorithms for polynomials assume in general a dense representation for the polynomials, that is storing the full list of coefficients. In contrast, we work with sparse polynomials, in which most coefficients vanish. In particular, we describe the first quasi-linear algorithm for sparse interpolation, which plays a role analogous to the Fast Fourier Transform in the sparse settings. We also explore computationally hard problems concerning divisibility and factorization of sparse polynomials.</description>

      <title>Views: a hardware-friendly graph database model for storing semantic information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The graph database (GDB) is an increasingly common storage model for data involving relationships between entries. Beyond its widespread usage in database industries, the advantages of GDBs indicate a strong potential in constructing symbolic artificial intelligences (AIs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where knowledge of data inter-relationships takes a critical role in implementation. However, current GDB models are not optimised for hardware acceleration, leading to bottlenecks in storage capacity and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly GDB model, called Views. We show its data structure and organisation tailored for efficient storage and retrieval of graph data and demonstrate its functional equivalence and storage performance advantage compared to represent traditional graph representations. We further demonstrate its symbolic processing abilities in semantic reasoning and cognitive modelling with practical examples and provide a short perspective on future developments.</description>
