      <title>Polynomially effective equidistribution for unipotent orbits in products of $\mathrm{SL}_2$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We sketch the proof of an effective equidistribution theorem for one-parameter unipotent subgroups in $S$-arithmetic quotients arising from $\mathbf K$-forms of $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\mathsf n}$ where $\mathbf K$ is a number field. This gives an effective version of equidistribution results of Ratner and Shah with a polynomial rate.
  The key new phenomenon is the existence of many intermediate groups between the $\mathrm{SL}_2$ containing our unipotent and the ambient group, which introduces potential local and global obstruction to equidistribution.
  Our approach relies on a Bourgain-type projection theorem in the presence of obstructions, together with a careful analysis of these obstructions.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and Hopf Bifurcation in Stuart--Landau Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model has shaped our understanding of synchronization in complex systems, yet its phase-only formulation neglects amplitude dynamics that are intrinsic to many oscillatory networks. In this work, we revisit Kuramoto-type synchronization through networks of Stuart--Landau oscillators, which arise as the universal normal form near a Hopf bifurcation. For identical natural frequencies, we analyze synchronization in two complementary regimes. Away from criticality, we establish topology-robust complete synchronization for general connected networks under explicit sufficient conditions that preclude amplitude death. At criticality, we exploit network symmetries to analyze the onset of collective oscillations via Hopf bifurcation theory, demonstrating the emergence of synchronized periodic states in ring-symmetric networks. Our results clarify how amplitude dynamics enrich the structure of synchronized states and provide a bridge between classical Kuramoto synchronization and amplitude-inclusive models in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of piecewise linear mechanical systems using invariant cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology that extends invariant manifold theory to a class of autonomous piecewise linear systems with nonsmoothness at the equilibrium, providing a framework for model order reduction in mechanical structures with compliant contact laws. The key idea is to make the absence of a local linearization around the equilibrium tractable by leveraging the positive homogeneity property. This property simplifies the invariance equations defining the geometry of the invariant cones, from a set of partial differential equations to a system of ordinary differential equations, enabling their effective solution. We introduce two techniques to compute these invariant cones. First, an intuitive graph-style parametrization is proposed that utilizes Fourier expansions and Chebyshev polynomials to derive explicit reduced-order models in closed form. Second, an arc-length parametrization is introduced to robustly compute invariant cones with complex folding geometries, which are intractable with a standard graph-style technique. The approach is demonstrated on mechanical oscillators with unilateral visco-elastic supports, showcasing its applicability for systems with both continuous (unilateral elastic) and discontinuous (unilateral visco-elastic) unilateral force laws.</description>

      <title>Non-Intrusive Hyperreduction by a Physics-Augmented Neural Network with Second-Order Sobolev Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite element method is an indispensable tool in engineering, but its computational complexity prevents applications for control or at system-level. Model order reduction bridges this gap, creating highly efficient yet accurate surrogate models. Reducing nonlinear setups additionally requires hyperreduction. Compatibility with commercial finite element software requires non-intrusive methods based on data. Methods include the trajectory piecewise linear approach, or regression, typically via neural networks. Important aspects for these methods are accuracy, efficiency, generalization, including desired physical and mathematical properties, and extrapolation. Especially the last two aspects are problematic for neural networks. Therefore, several studies investigated how to incorporate physical knowledge or desirable properties. A promising approach from constitutive modeling is physics augmented neural networks. This concept has been elegantly transferred to hyperreduction by Fleres et al. in 2025 and guarantees several desired properties, incorporates physics, can include parameters, and results in smaller architectures. We augment this reference work by second-order Sobolev training, i.e., using a function and its first two derivatives. These are conveniently accessible and promise improved performance. Further modifications are proposed and studied. While Sobolev training does not meet expectations, several minor changes improve accuracy by up to an order of magnitude. Eventually, our best model is compared to reference work and the trajectory piecewise linear approach. The comparison relies on the same numerical case study as the reference work and additionally emphasizes extrapolation due to its critical role in typical applications. Our results indicate quick divergence of physics-augmented neural networks for extrapolation, preventing its deployment.</description>

      <title>The Wiener Wintner and Return Times Theorem Along the Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following Return Times Theorem along the sequence of prime times, the first extension of the Return Times Theorem to arithmetic sequences:
  For every probability space, $(\Omega,\nu)$, equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T \colon \Omega \to \Omega$, and every $f \in L^\infty(\Omega)$, there exists a set of full probability, $\Omega_f \subset \Omega$ with $\nu(\Omega_f) =1$, so that for all $\omega \in \Omega_f$, for any other probability space $(X,\mu)$, equipped with a measure-preserving transformation $S : X \to X$, for any $g \in L^{\infty}(X)$,
  \begin{align}
  \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} f(T^{p_n} \omega) g(S^{p_n} \cdot)
  \end{align}
  converges $\mu$-almost surely; above, $\{ 2=p_1 &lt; p_2 &lt; \dots \}$ are an enumeration of the primes. The Wiener-Wintner theorem along the primes
  is an immediate corollary.
  Our proof lives at the interface of classical Fourier analysis, combinatorial number theory, higher order Fourier analysis, and pointwise ergodic theory, with $U^3$ theory playing an important role; our $U^3$-estimates for \emph{Heath-Brown} models of the von Mangoldt function may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We establish a non-commutative version of the Intermediate Factor Theorem for crossed products associated with product lattices. Given an irreducible lattice $\Gamma &lt; G= G_1 \times \dots \times G_d$ in higher rank semisimple algebraic groups and a trace-preserving irreducible action $G \curvearrowright (\mathcal{N}, \tau)$, we show that every intermediate von Neumann algebra between $\mathcal{N}\rtimes\Gamma$ and $(L^\infty(G/P,\nu_P)\overline{\otimes}\mathcal{N})\rtimes\Gamma$ is again a crossed product of the form $(L^\infty(G/Q,\nu_Q)\overline{\otimes}\mathcal{N})\rtimes\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algebraic telic problem is a decision problem in $\textsf{NP}_\mathbb{R}$ formalizing finite-time reachability questions for one-dimensional dynamical systems. We prove that the existence of "natural" mapping reductions between algebraic telic problems coming from distinct dynamical systems implies the two dynamical systems exhibit similar behavior (in a precise sense). As a consequence, we obtain explicit barriers for algorithms solving algebraic telic problems coming from complex dynamical systems, such as those with positive topological entropy. For example, some telic problems cannot be decided by uniform arithmetic circuit families with only $+$ and $\times$ gates.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Model for Synergistic Oncolytic Virotherapy: Unveiling the Ping-Pong Mechanism and Optimal Timing of Combined Vesicular Stomatitis and Vaccinia Viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical model that describes the synergistic mechanism of combined Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Vaccinia Virus (VV). The model captures the dynamic interplay between tumor cells, viral replication, and the interferon-mediated immune response, revealing a `ping-pong' synergy where VV-infected cells produce B18R protein that neutralizes interferon-$\alpha$, thereby enhancing VSV replication within the tumor. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this combination achieves complete tumor clearance in approximately 50 days, representing an 11\% acceleration compared to VV monotherapy (56 days), while VSV alone fails to eradicate tumors. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical thresholds for viral burst size and B18R inhibition, while sensitivity analysis highlights infection rates and burst sizes as the most influential parameters for treatment efficacy. Temporal optimization reveals that therapeutic outcomes are maximized through immediate VSV administration followed by delayed VV injection within a 1-19 day window, offering a strategic approach to overcome the timing and dosing challenges inherent in OVT.</description>

      <title>$\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in number fields and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:1507.00855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010, Sarnak initiated the study of the dynamics of the system determined by the square of the M\"obius function (the characteristic function of the square-free integers). We deal with his program in the more general context of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in number fields, suggested 5 years later by Baake and Huck. This setting encompasses the classical square-free case and its generalizations. Given a number field $K$, let $\mathfrak{B}$ be a family of pairwise coprime ideals in its ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, such that $\sum_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}1/|\mathcal{O}_K / \mathfrak{b}|&lt;\infty$. We study the dynamical system determined by the set $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}=\mathcal{O}_K\setminus \bigcup_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}\mathfrak{b}$ of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in $\mathcal{O}_K$. We show that the characteristic function $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$ of $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ is generic along the natural F\o{}lner sequence for a probability measure on $\{0,1\}^{\mathcal{O}_K}$, invariant under the multidimensional shift. The corresponding measure-theoretical dynamical system is proved to be isomorphic to an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group. In particular, it is of zero Kolmogorov entropy. Moreover, we provide a description of ``patterns'' appearing in $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ and compute the topological entropy of the orbit closure of $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$. Finally, we show that this topological dynamical system has a non-trivial topological joining with an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group.</description>

Abstract: We perform a multifractal analysis of the growth rate of the number of cusp windings for the geodesic flow on hyperbolic surfaces with $m \geq 1$ cusps. Our main theorem establishes a conditional variational principle for the Hausdorff dimension spectrum of the multi-cusp winding process. Moreover, we show that the dimension spectrum defined on $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}^m$ is real analytic. To prove the main theorem we use a countable Markov shift with a finitely primitive transition matrix and thermodynamic formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15945v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel EDMD-type algorithm that captures the spectrum of the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic functions. This method, which we call analytic EDMD, relies on an orthogonal projection on polynomial subspaces, which is equivalent to a data-driven Taylor approximation. In the case of dynamics with a hyperbolic equilibrium, analytic EDMD demonstrates excellent performance to capture the lattice-structured Koopman spectrum based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system at the equilibrium. Moreover, it yields the Taylor approximation of associated principal eigenfunctions. Since the method preserves the triangular structure of the operator, it does not suffer from spectral pollution and, moreover, arbitrary accuracy on the spectrum can be reached with a fixed finite dimension of the approximation and with a (possibly non-uniform) sampling over an arbitrary set of nonzero measure. The performance of analytic EDMD is illustrated with numerical examples and is assessed through a comparative study with related methods. Finally, the method is complemented with theoretical results, proving strong convergence of the eigenfunctions and providing error bounds on the spectrum estimation.</description>

Abstract: We show that the convergence rate of the cusp winding spectrum to the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of a generalized Schottky group with one parabolic generator is polynomial. Our main theorem provides the new phenomenon in which differences in the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set generated by a Markov system cause essentially different results on multifractal analysis. This paper also provides a new characterization of the geodesic flow on the Poinca\'re disc model of two-dimensional hyperbolic space and the limit set of a generalized Schottky group. To prove our main theorem we use thermodynamic formalism on a countable Markov shift, gamma function, and zeta function.</description>

      <title>False Data-Injection Attack Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Reachability Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-physical system (CPS) is the foundational backbone of modern critical infrastructures, so ensuring its security and resilience against cyber-attacks is of pivotal importance. This paper addresses the challenge of designing anomaly detectors for CPS under false-data injection (FDI) attacks and stochastic disturbances governed by unknown probability distribution. By using the Wasserstein ambiguity set, a prevalent data-driven tool in distributionally robust optimization (DRO), we first propose a new security metric to deal with the absence of disturbance distribution. This metric is designed by asymptotic reachability analysis of state deviations caused by stealthy FDI attacks and disturbance in a distributionally robust confidence set. We then formulate the detector design as a DRO problem that optimizes this security metric while controlling the false alarm rate robustly under a set of distributions. This yields a trade-off between robustness to disturbance and performance degradation under stealthy attacks. The resulting design problem turns out to be a challenging semi-infinite program due to the existence of distributionally robust chance constraints. We derive its exact albeit non-convex reformulation and develop an effective solution algorithm based on sequential minimization. Finally, a case study on a simulated three-tank is illustrated to demonstrate the efficiency of our design in robustifying against unknown disturbance distribution.</description>

Abstract: We prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold under mild assumptions on the size of $m$. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show $m=2$ suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in \cite{D02} about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>A flux-based approach for analyzing the disguised toric locus of reaction networks</title>

Abstract: Dynamical systems with polynomial right-hand sides are very important in various applications, e.g., in biochemistry and population dynamics. The mathematical study of these dynamical systems is challenging due to the possibility of multistability, oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. One important tool for this study is the concept of reaction systems, which are dynamical systems generated by reaction networks for some choices of parameter values. Among these, disguised toric systems are remarkably stable: they have a unique attracting fixed point, and cannot give rise to oscillations or chaotic dynamics. The computation of the set of parameter values for which a network gives rise to disguised toric systems (i.e., the disguised toric locus of the network) is an important but difficult task. We introduce new ideas based on network fluxes for studying the disguised toric locus. We prove that the disguised toric locus of any network $G$ is a contractible manifold with boundary, and introduce an associated graph $G^{\max}$ that characterizes its interior. These theoretical tools allow us, for the first time, to compute the full disguised toric locus for many networks of interest.</description>

      <title>Global dynamical structures from infinitesimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientists and engineers alike target modeling of complex, high dimensional, and nonlinear dynamical systems as a central goal. Machine learning breakthroughs alongside mounting computation and data advance the efficacy of learning from trajectory measurements. However scientifically interpreting data-driven models, e.g., localizing attracting sets and their basins, remains elusive. Such limitations particularly afflict identification of system-level regulatory mechanisms characteristic of living systems, e.g., stabilizing control for whole-body locomotion, where discontinuous, transient, and multiscale phenomena are common and prior models are rare. As a next step towards theory-grounded discovery of behavioral mechanisms in biology and beyond, we introduce VERT, a framework for discovering attracting sets from trajectories without recourse to any global model. Our infinitesimal-local-global (ILG) pipeline estimates the proximity of any sampled state to an attracting set, if one exists, with formal accuracy guarantees. We demonstrate our approach on phenomenological and physical oscillators with hierarchical and impulsive dynamics, finding sensitivity to both global and intermediate attractors composed in sequence and parallel. Application of VERT to human running kinematics data reveals insight into control modules that stabilize task-level dynamics, supporting a longstanding neuromechanical control hypothesis. The VERT framework promotes rigorous inference of underlying dynamical structure even for systems where learning a global dynamics model is impractical or impossible.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising connection between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d,c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d,c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n &gt; 1$ and $d &gt; 2$ is an integer. As before, we wish to study counting problems which are inspired by exciting advances in arithmetic statistics, and again partly by point-counting result of Narkiewicz on real $K$-rational periodic points of any odd degree map $\varphi_{d,c}$ in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any real algebraic number field $K$ of degree $n \geq 2$, and for any prime $p \geq 3$ and integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell},c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $3$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting result of Benedetto on any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell},c}$ for any prime $p \geq 5$ and integer $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove unconditionally that for any number field (not necessarily real) $K$ of degree $n \geq 2$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell},c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials and number fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Orbit Elements from Kepler Solutions in Projective Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.</description>

      <title>Chamber zeta function and closed galleries in the standard non-uniform complex from $\operatorname{PGL}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $\Gamma\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $\Gamma=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</description>
