      <title>Modeling the dynamics of the Hepatitis B virus via a variable-order discrete system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the hepatitis B virus by integrating variable-order calculus and discrete analysis. Specifically, we utilize the Caputo variable-order difference operator in this study. To establish the existence and uniqueness results of the model, we employ a fixed-point technique. Furthermore, we prove that the model exhibits bounded and positive solutions. Additionally, we explore the local stability of the proposed model by determining the basic reproduction number. Finally, we present several numerical simulations to illustrate the richness of our results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behavior of Predator-Prey with Allee Effect on Both Populations and Disease in Predator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current study, we took into account a model of nonlinear ``predator-prey'' interactions including the ``Allee effect'' on both populations and disease in the predator population. The population as a whole is split into three: the prey population, susceptible predator, and diseased predator. The ``Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) impulsive control model'' and the Fuzzy impulsive control model have been used to test the stability of the three-dimensional ``Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system'' model. Following the model's formulation, the global-stability and the fuzzy solution are examined using numerical simulations and graphical displays, together with the necessary consultation, to help comprehend the effectiveness of our suggested model.</description>

      <title>Formulating human risk response in epidemic models: exogenous vs endogenous approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent pandemic emphasized the need to consider the role of human behavior in shaping epidemic dynamics. In particular, it is necessary to extend beyond the classical epidemiological structures to fully capture the interplay between the spread of disease and how people respond. Here, we focus on the challenge of incorporating change in human behavior in the form of "risk response" into compartmental epidemiological models, where humans adapt their actions in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The review examines over 40 compartmental models, categorizing them into two fundamentally distinct classes: exogenous and endogenous approaches to modeling risk response. While in exogenous approaches, human behavior is often included using different fixed parameter values for certain time periods, endogenous approaches seek for a mechanism internal to the model to explain changes in human behavior as a function of the state of disease. We further discuss two different formulations within endogenous models as implicit versus explicit representation of information diffusion. This comprehensive analysis provides modelers with guidance in selecting an appropriate framework for epidemic modeling.</description>

      <title>Generating-functional analysis of random Lotka-Volterra systems: A step-by-step guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides what is hopefully a self-contained set of notes describing the detailed steps of a generating-functional analysis of systems of generalised Lotka-Volterra equations with random interaction coefficients. Nothing in these notes is original, instead the generating-functional method (also known as the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominic-Janssen formalism) and the resulting dynamic mean field theories have been used for the study of disordered systems and spin glasses for decades. But it is hard to find unifying sources which would allow a beginner to learn step-by-step how these methods can be used. My aim is to provide such a source. Most of the calculations are specific to generalised Lotka-Volterra systems, but much can be transferred to disordered systems in more general.</description>
