      <title>Assessing the Effects of Container Handling Strategies on Enhancing Freight Throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global supply chains and freight volumes grow, the U.S. faces escalating transportation demands. The heavy reliance on road transport, coupled with the underutilization of the railway system, results in congested highways, prolonged transportation times, higher costs, and increased carbon emissions. California's San Pedro Port Complex (SPPC), the nation's busiest, incurs a significant share of these challenges. We utilize an agent-based simulation to replicate real-world scenarios, focusing on the intricacies of interactions in a modified intermodal inbound freight system for the SPPC. This involves relocating container classification to potential warehouses in California, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada, rather than exclusively at port areas. Our primary aim is to evaluate the proposed system's efficiency, considering cost and freight throughput, while also examining the effects of workforce shortages. Computational analysis suggests that strategically installing intermodal capabilities in select warehouses can reduce transportation costs, boost throughput, and foster resour</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous graph attention network improves cancer multiomics integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in high-dimensional multiomics data demands advanced integration models to capture the complexity of human diseases. Graph-based deep learning integration models, despite their promise, struggle with small patient cohorts and high-dimensional features, often applying independent feature selection without modeling relationships among omics. Furthermore, conventional graph-based omics models focus on homogeneous graphs, lacking multiple types of nodes and edges to capture diverse structures. We introduce a Heterogeneous Graph ATtention network for omics integration (HeteroGATomics) to improve cancer diagnosis. HeteroGATomics performs joint feature selection through a multi-agent system, creating dedicated networks of feature and patient similarity for each omic modality. These networks are then combined into one heterogeneous graph for learning holistic omic-specific representations and integrating predictions across modalities. Experiments on three cancer multiomics datasets demonstrate HeteroGATomics' superior performance in cancer diagnosis. Moreover, HeteroGATomics enhances interpretability by identifying important biomarkers contributing to the diagnosis outcomes.</description>

      <title>KAOS: Large Model Multi-Agent Operating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intelligent interaction model based on large models reduces the differences in user experience across various system platforms but faces challenges in multi-agent collaboration and resource sharing. To demonstrate a uniform user experience across different foundational software platforms and address resource coordination management challenges, this paper proposes KAOS, a multi-agent operating system based on the open-source Kylin. The research method involves empowering agents with large models to serve applications. First, by introducing management role agents and vertical multi-agent collaboration to construct or replace typical application software. Second, by studying system-level shared resource scheduling strategies to enhance user experience and optimize resource utilization. And finally, by validating the efficiency and superiority of the large model multi-agent operating system through real applications and scoring intelligence. The feasibility of this system is demonstrated, providing a new perspective for the development of multi-agent operating systems. Experimental results show significant advantages of multi-agent collaboration in various application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cooperation and Control in Delegation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many settings of interest involving humans and machines -- from virtual personal assistants to autonomous vehicles -- can naturally be modelled as principals (humans) delegating to agents (machines), which then interact with each other on their principals' behalf. We refer to these multi-principal, multi-agent scenarios as delegation games. In such games, there are two important failure modes: problems of control (where an agent fails to act in line their principal's preferences) and problems of cooperation (where the agents fail to work well together). In this paper we formalise and analyse these problems, further breaking them down into issues of alignment (do the players have similar preferences?) and capabilities (how competent are the players at satisfying those preferences?). We show -- theoretically and empirically -- how these measures determine the principals' welfare, how they can be estimated using limited observations, and thus how they might be used to help us design more aligned and cooperative AI systems.</description>

      <title>A Picture Is Worth a Graph: A Blueprint Debate Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study aimed at introducing multi-agent debate into multimodal reasoning. The study addresses two key challenges: the trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts. Extensive experiments validate that BDoG is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in ScienceQA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/thecharm/BDoG.</description>
