      <title>The effect of HVDC lines in power-grids via Kuramoto modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study on the synchronization and cascade failure behaviour by solving the adaptive second-order Kuramoto model on a large high voltage (HV) European power-grid. This non-perturbative analysis takes into account non-linear effects, which occur even when phase differences are large, when the system is away from the steady state, and even during a blackout cascade. Our dynamical simulations show that improvements in the phase synchronziation stabilization as well as the in the cascade sizes can be related to the finite size scaling behaviour of the second order Kuramoto on graphs with $d_s&lt;4$ spectral dimensions. On the other hand drawbacks in the frequency spread and Braess effects also occur by varying the total transmitted power at large and small global couplings, presumably when the fluctuations are small, causing a freezing in the dynamics. We compare simulations of the fully AC model with those of static or adaptive High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) line replacements. The adaptive (local frequency difference-based) HVDC lines are more efficient in the steady state, at the expense of very long relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Strategic Network Abandonment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socio-economic networks, from cities and firms to collaborative projects, often appear resilient for long periods before experiencing rapid, cascading decline as participation erodes. We explain such dynamics through a framework of strategic network abandonment, in which interconnected agents choose activity levels in a network game and remain active only if participation yields higher utility than an improving outside option. As outside opportunities rise, agents exit endogenously, triggering equilibrium readjustments that may either dissipate locally or propagate through the network. The resulting decay dynamics are governed by the strength of strategic complementarities, measuring how strongly an agent's incentives depend on the actions of others. When complementarities are weak, decay follows a heterogeneous threshold process analogous to bootstrap percolation: failures are driven by local neighborhoods, vulnerable clusters can be identified ex ante, and large cascades emerge only through bottom-up accumulation of fragility. When complementarities are strong, departures propagate globally, producing rupture-like dynamics characterized by metastable plateaus, abrupt system-wide collapse, and limited predictive power of standard spectral or structural indicators. The comparative effective of intervention depends on the strength of complementarity as well: Supporting central agents is most effective under strong complementarities, whereas targeting marginal agents is essential when complementarities are weak. Together, our results reveal how outside options, network structure, and strategic interdependence jointly determine both the fragility of socio-economic networks and the policies required to sustain them.</description>

      <title>Decarbonizing China's private passenger vehicles: A dynamic material flow assessment of metal demands and embodied emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous growth of China's private passenger vehicle fleet has intensified material demand and embodied carbon emissions, underscoring the need for effective decarbonization pathways. This study develops a transferable, dynamic material flow analysis framework to assess vehicle stocks, metal flows (steel, aluminum, and copper), and embodied emissions from 2000 to 2070, and to quantify the contributions of demand-side and technology-side efficiency measures. The results reveal that: (1) The vehicle fleet is projected to peak at 327-507 million vehicles by mid-century, with new energy vehicles dominating both in-use stocks and end-of-life flows by the 2040s. (2) Cumulative metal demand is projected to reach 1914-2990 million tonnes over the upcoming five decades, with 879-1320 million tonnes supplied from secondary sources under baseline conditions. Technology-oriented measures substantially enhance recycling performance, enabling secondary steel to fully meet manufacturing demand and allowing aluminum and copper cycles to approach near closure by 2070. (3) Correspondingly, cumulative embodied carbon emissions from vehicle metals by 2070 range from 4958 to 9218 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, with technological upgrading reducing emissions by 1051-1619 megatonnes. In collaborative scenarios, demand management accounts for 64.3% of total emission reductions, while technology-oriented measures become increasingly important over the medium to long term. Overall, the findings demonstrate that unmanaged demand growth can substantially offset technological mitigation gains, highlighting the necessity of integrated demand- and technology-oriented strategies. This study provides a systemic and transferable framework to guide circular economy development and deep decarbonization transitions in vehicle fleets in China and other emerging economies.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Oscillatory Regimes of Global Synchrony Induced by Secondary Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization systems with effective inertia, such as power grid networks and coupled electromechanical oscillators, are commonly modeled by the second-order Kuramoto model. In the forward process, numerical simulations exhibit a staircase-like growth of global synchrony, reflecting temporal oscillations induced by secondary synchronized clusters of whirling oscillators. While this behavior has been observed previously, its governing conditions have not been quantitatively determined in terms of analytical criteria. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that explicitly characterizes the secondary synchronized clusters. This analysis identifies an onset crossover mass $\tilde{m}^* \simeq 3.865$ for the emergence of secondary clusters and yields quantitative criteria for predicting both the crossover mass and the termination coupling strength at which they vanish. As a result, we determine the oscillatory regimes of coupling strengths over which global synchrony shows temporal oscillations, providing practical guidance for controlling and avoiding undesirable oscillatory behavior in inertial synchronization systems, such as power grids.</description>

      <title>Picture an Astronomer: Best Practices for Retaining Talent in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Women are consistently underrepresented in astrophysics yet are simultaneously subject to disproportionate attrition at every career stage. This disparity between demonstrated efficacy in job performance and ultimate career outcome was the primary motivation for the Picture an Astronomer series, which included both targeted public outreach to increase representation of women in astrophysics and high-level, solution-oriented discussions among professional astronomers. In March 2025, more than 200 astronomers came together in a hybrid-format symposium focused on the state of the field for female scientists, combining scientific exchange with discussions of policies and practices to strengthen retention of talent in the field. This white paper is the result of those discussions, offering a wide range of recommendations developed in the context of gendered attrition in astrophysics but which ultimately support a healthier climate for all scientists alike.</description>

      <title>Structured Production Systems: Viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for analysing equilibrium in structured production systems incorporating a static social division of labour by distinguishing between consumption goods traded in competitive markets and intermediate goods exchanged through bilateral relationships. We develop the concept of viability -- the requirement that all producers earn positive incomes -- as a foundational equilibrium prerequisite.
  Our main theoretical contribution establishes that acyclic production systems -- those without circular conversion processes among goods -- are always viable, a condition that implies coherence. We characterise completely viable systems through input restrictions demonstrating that prohibiting consumption goods as inputs for other consumption goods is necessary for ensuring viable prices exist for all consumption good price vectors. The analysis reveals fundamental relationships between production system architectural design and economic sustainability.
  The introduced framework bridges Leontief-Sraffa production theory with modern network economics while capturing institutional realities of contemporary production systems. This also results in a contribution of the literature on the existence of a positive output price system and the Hawkins-Simon condition.</description>

      <title>Reducibility of higher-order networks from dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08547v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical complex systems can be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions influencing collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' apparent superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost, challenging their application. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a valuable description of empirical systems. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework, accounting for how structure affect diffusion behaviors, quantifying the entropic cost and distinguishability of higher-order interactions to assess their reducibility to lower-order structures while preserving relevant functional information. Empirical analyses indicate that some systems retain essential higher-order structure, whereas in some technological and biological networks it collapses to pairwise interactions. With controlled randomization procedures, we investigate the role of nestedness and degree heterogeneity in this reducibility process. Our findings contribute to ongoing efforts to minimize the dimensionality of models for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Operational Validation of LLM-Agent Social Simulations: A Replicated Study of a Reddit-like Technology Forum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative social simulations that can capture culturally informed, norm-guided interaction on online social platforms. We build a technology community simulation modeled on Voat, a Reddit-like alt-right news aggregator and discussion platform active from 2014 to 2020. Using the YSocial framework, we seed the simulation with a fixed catalog of technology links sampled from Voat's shared URLs (covering 30+ domains) and calibrate parameters to Voat's v/technology using samples from the MADOC dataset. Agents use a base, uncensored model (Dolphin 3.0, based on Llama 3.1 8B) and concise personas (demographics, political leaning, interests, education, toxicity propensity) to generate posts, replies, and reactions under platform rules for link and text submissions, threaded replies and daily activity cycles. We run a 30-day simulation and evaluate operational validity by comparing distributions and structures with matched Voat data: activity patterns, interaction networks, toxicity, and topic coverage. Results indicate familiar online regularities: similar activity rhythms, heavy-tailed participation, sparse low-clustering interaction networks, core-periphery structure, topical alignment with Voat, and elevated toxicity. Limitations of the current study include the stateless agent design and evaluation based on a single 30-day run, which constrains external validity and variance estimates. The simulation generates realistic discussions, often featuring toxic language, primarily centered on technology topics such as Big Tech and AI. This approach offers a valuable method for examining toxicity dynamics and testing moderation strategies within a controlled environment.</description>
