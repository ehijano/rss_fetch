      <title>Bridging the Digital Divide: Small Language Models as a Pathway for Physics and Photonics Education in Underdeveloped Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited infrastructure, scarce educational resources, and unreliable internet access often hinder physics and photonics education in underdeveloped regions. These barriers create deep inequities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. This article explores how Small Language Models (SLMs)-compact, AI-powered tools that can run offline on low-power devices, offering a scalable solution. By acting as virtual tutors, enabling native-language instruction, and supporting interactive learning, SLMs can help address the shortage of trained educators and laboratory access. By narrowing the digital divide through targeted investment in AI technologies, SLMs present a scalable and inclusive solution to advance STEM education and foster scientific empowerment in marginalized communities.</description>

      <title>Improving Student Self-Confidence in Quantum Computing with the Qubit Touchdown Board Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit Touchdown is a two-player, competitive board game that was developed to introduce students to quantum computing. A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that is based on the laws of quantum physics, and it can solve certain problems faster than normal computers because it follows a different set of rules. Qubit Touchdown's game play mirrors the rules of (American) football, with players taking turns moving the football to score the most touchdowns, and no knowledge of quantum computing is needed to play the game. We evaluated the game with 107 public high school students in Precalculus, Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics, and/or AP Physics 1 courses, assessing whether their interest in and self-confidence in their ability to learn quantum computing changed as a result of playing the game and learning about its connections to quantum computing. We also assessed whether the game was easy to learn and enjoyable. We found that students' interest in quantum computing increased slightly ($p&lt;0.05$), but students' self-confidence in their ability to learn quantum computing saw greater gains ($p&lt;0.001$); students also widely considered the game accessible and fun. Thus, Qubit Touchdown could be an effective resource to introduce students to Quantum Computing and boost their confidence in learning about the field. Free printables of the game are available, and professionally produced copies can be purchased on demand.</description>

      <title>Interference of interference effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the interference of individual photons in a linear-optical setup comprised of two overlapping Mach-Zehnder interferometers joined via a common beam splitter. We show how, in this setup, two kinds of standard interference effects -- namely, single-photon Mach-Zehnder interference and two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference -- interfere with one another, partially canceling each other out. This new perspective, along with the overall pedagogical exposition of this work, is intended as an intuitive illustration of why quantum effects can combine nontrivially and, moreover, of the fundamental notion that quantum interference happens at measurement. This work can serve as a bridge to more advanced quantum mechanical concepts. For instance, analyses of this setup in terms of entanglement have a rich history and can be used to test the predictions of quantum mechanics versus local realism (e.g., as in Hardy's Paradox).</description>
