      <title>Safety and Security Dynamics in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries: A Machine Learning Approach to Forecasting Security Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GCC region includes Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman, which are of critical geopolitical and economic importance, being rich in oil and positioned along vital maritime routes. However, the region faces complex security challenges, ranging from traditional threats like interstate conflicts to nontraditional risks such as cyber-attacks, piracy, and environmental concerns. This study investigates the safety and security index for six GCC countries using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost, to forecast security trends for the next five years. Data from the Global Peace Index and World Bank development indicators were employed to construct the model. Key indicators related to economic, political, and environmental factors were selected using the Edit Distance on Real Sequence feature selection method. The model demonstrated high accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage error of less than 10% across all countries. The results indicate that Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are likely to experience improvements in their safety and security indexes. At the same time, Kuwait and Oman may face challenges in maintaining their current levels of security. The findings suggest that economic diversification, environmental sustainability, and social stability are critical for ensuring long-term security in the region. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers in designing proactive strategies to address emerging security threats.</description>

      <title>Why is it so hard to find a job now? Enter Ghost Jobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the emerging phenomenon of "ghost hiring" or "ghost jobs", where employers advertise job openings without intending to fill them. Using a novel dataset from Glassdoor and employing a LLM-BERT technique, I find that up to 21% of job ads may be ghost jobs, and this is particularly prevalent in specialized industries and in larger firms. The trend could be due to the low marginal cost of posting additional job ads and to maintain a pipeline of talents. After adjusting for yearly trends, I find that ghost jobs can explain the recent disconnect in the Beveridge Curve in the past fifteen years. The results show that policy-makers should be aware of such a practice as it causes significant job fatigue and distorts market signals.</description>

      <title>American Views About Election Fraud in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the opinions of American registered voters about election fraud and types of election fraud as we head into the final stages of the 2024 Presidential election? In this paper we use data from an online national survey of 2,211 U.S. registered voters interviewed between June 26 - July 3, 2024. Respondents were asked how common they thought that ten different types of election fraud might be in the U.S. In our analysis, we show that substantial proportions of U.S. registered voters believe that these types of election fraud are common. Our multivariate analysis shows that partisanship correlates strongly with endorsement of types of election fraud, with Republicans consistently more likely to state that types of election fraud are common, even when we control for a wide variety of other factors. We also find that conspiratorial thinking is strongly correlated with belief in the occurrence of types of election fraud, even when we control for partisanship. Our results reported in this paper provide important data regarding how American registered voters perceive the prevalence of types of election fraud, just months before the 2024 Presidential election.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Think Like Humans? A Behavioral Evaluation of LLM-Agents in Dictator Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly undertake real-world tasks and engage with human society, how well do we understand their behaviors? This study (1) investigates how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors -- a fundamental social norm -- can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduces a behavioral approach to evaluate the performance of LLM agents in complex decision-making scenarios. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. Our findings reveal substantial variations and inconsistencies among LLMs and notable differences compared to human behaviors. Merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. Despite being trained on extensive human-generated data, these AI agents cannot accurately predict human decisions. LLM agents are not able to capture the internal processes of human decision-making, and their alignment with human behavior is highly variable and dependent on specific model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern.</description>

      <title>EconoJax: A Fast &amp; Scalable Economic Simulation in Jax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate economic simulations often require many experimental runs, particularly when combined with reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, training reinforcement learning agents in multi-agent economic environments can be slow. This paper introduces EconoJax, a fast simulated economy, based on the AI economist. EconoJax, and its training pipeline, are completely written in JAX. This allows EconoJax to scale to large population sizes and perform large experiments, while keeping training times within minutes. Through experiments with populations of 100 agents, we show how real-world economic behavior emerges through training within 15 minutes, in contrast to previous work that required several days. To aid and inspire researchers to build more rich and dynamic economic simulations, we open-source EconoJax on Github at: https://github.com/ponseko/econojax.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, and low-pollution firms. Mechanism analysis shows that green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>
