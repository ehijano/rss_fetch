      <title>Underlying Core Inflation with Multiple Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for estimating core inflation indicators based on common factors across a broad range of price indices. Specifically, by utilizing procedures for detecting multiple regimes in high-dimensional factor models, we propose two types of core inflation indicators: one incorporating multiple structural breaks and another based on Markov switching. The structural breaks approach can eliminate revisions for past regimes, though it functions as an offline indicator, as real-time detection of breaks is not feasible with this method. On the other hand, the Markov switching approach can reduce revisions while being useful in real time, making it a simple and robust core inflation indicator suitable for real-time monitoring and as a short-term guide for monetary policy. Additionally, this approach allows us to estimate the probability of being in different inflationary regimes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these indicators, we apply them to Canadian price data. To compare the real-time performance of the Markov switching approach to the benchmark model without regime-switching, we assess their abilities to forecast headline inflation and minimize revisions. We find that the Markov switching model delivers superior predictive accuracy and significantly reduces revisions during periods of substantial inflation changes. Hence, our findings suggest that accounting for time-varying factors and parameters enhances inflation signal accuracy and reduces data requirements, especially following sudden economic shifts.</description>

      <title>Price Setting Rules, Rounding Tax, and Inattention Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the price rounding regulation in Israel, which outlawed non-0-ending prices, forcing retailers to round 9 ending prices, which in many stores, comprised more than 60 percent of all prices. The goal of the regulation was to eliminate the rounding tax, the extra amount consumers paid because of price rounding, which was necessitated by the abolition of low denomination coins, and the inattention tax, the extra amount consumers paid the retailers because of their inattention to the prices rightmost digits. Using 4 different datasets, we assess the success of the government in achieving these goals, focusing on fast moving consumer goods, a category of products strongly affected by the price rounding regulation. We focus on the response of the retailers to the price rounding regulation and find that although the government succeeded in eliminating the rounding tax, the bottom line is that shoppers end up paying more, not less, because of the regulation, underscoring, once again, the warning of Milton Friedman that policies should be judged by their results, not by their intentions.</description>

      <title>Trade, Trees, and Lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows a cascading mechanism through which international trade-induced deforestation results in a decline of health outcomes in cities distant from where trade activities occur. We examine Brazil, which has ramped up agricultural export over the last two decades to meet rising global demand. Using a shift-share research design, we first show that export shocks cause substantial local agricultural expansion and a virtual one-for-one decline in forest cover. We then construct a dynamic area-of-effect model that predicts where atmospheric changes should be felt - due to loss of forests that would otherwise serve to filter out and absorb air pollutants as they travel - downwind of the deforestation areas. Leveraging quasi-random variation in these atmospheric connections, we establish a causal link between deforestation upstream and subsequent rises in air pollution and premature deaths downstream, with the mortality effects predominantly driven by cardiovascular and respiratory causes. Our estimates reveal a large telecoupled health externality of trade deforestation: over 700,000 premature deaths in Brazil over the past two decades. This equates to $0.18 loss in statistical life value per $1 agricultural exports over the study period.</description>

      <title>Simulating Liquidity: Agent-Based Modeling of Illiquid Markets for Fractional Ownership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates liquidity dynamics in fractional ownership markets, focusing on illiquid alternative investments traded on a FinTech platform. By leveraging empirical data and employing agent-based modeling (ABM), the study simulates trading behaviors in sell offer-driven systems, providing a foundation for generating insights into how different market structures influence liquidity. The ABM-based simulation model provides a data augmentation environment which allows for the exploration of diverse trading architectures and rules, offering an alternative to direct experimentation. This approach bridges academic theory and practical application, supported by collaboration with industry and Swiss federal funding. The paper lays the foundation for planned extensions, including the identification of a liquidity-maximizing trading environment and the design of a market maker, by simulating the current functioning of the investment platform using an ABM specified with empirical data.</description>

      <title>The Role of Accuracy and Validation Effectiveness in Conversational Business Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines conversational business analytics, an approach that utilizes AI to address the technical competency gaps that hinder end users from effectively using traditional self-service analytics. By facilitating natural language interactions, conversational business analytics aims to empower end users to independently retrieve data and generate insights. The analysis focuses on Text-to-SQL as a representative technology for translating natural language requests into SQL statements. Developing theoretical models grounded in expected utility theory, the study identifies conditions under which conversational business analytics, through partial or full support, can outperform delegation to human experts. The results indicate that partial support, focusing solely on information generation by AI, is viable when the accuracy of AI-generated SQL queries leads to a profit that surpasses the performance of a human expert. In contrast, full support includes not only information generation but also validation through explanations provided by the AI, and requires sufficiently high validation effectiveness to be reliable. However, user-based validation presents challenges, such as misjudgment and rejection of valid SQL queries, which may limit the effectiveness of conversational business analytics. These challenges underscore the need for robust validation mechanisms, including improved user support, automated processes, and methods for assessing quality independently of end users' technical competencies.</description>
