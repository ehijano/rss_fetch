      <title>Neuromorphic Heart Rate Monitors: Neural State Machines for Monotonic Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting monotonic changes in heart rate (HR) is crucial for early identification of cardiac conditions and health management. This is particularly important for dementia patients, where HR trends can signal stress or agitation. Developing wearable technologies that can perform always-on monitoring of HRs is essential to effectively detect slow changes over extended periods of time. However, designing compact electronic circuits that can monitor and process bio-signals continuously, and that can operate in a low-power regime to ensure long-lasting performance, is still an open challenge. Neuromorphic technology offers an energy-efficient solution for real-time health monitoring. We propose a neuromorphic implementation of a Neural State Machine (NSM) network to encode different health states and switch between them based on the input stimuli. Our focus is on detecting monotonic state switches in electrocardiogram data to identify progressive HR increases. This innovative approach promises significant advancements in continuous health monitoring and management.</description>

      <title>FrameCorr: Adaptive, Autoencoder-based Neural Compression for Video Reconstruction in Resource and Timing Constrained Network Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of video processing via Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to their cost-effectiveness, transmitting captured data to nearby servers poses challenges due to varying timing constraints and scarcity of network bandwidth. Existing video compression methods face difficulties in recovering compressed data when incomplete data is provided. Here, we introduce \emph{\project}, a deep-learning based solution that utilizes previously received data to predict the missing segments of a frame, enabling the reconstruction of a frame from partially received data.</description>

      <title>A design of magnetic tunnel junctions for the deployment of neuromorphic hardware for edge computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrically readable complex dynamics of robust and scalable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) offer promising opportunities for advancing neuromorphic computing. In this work, we present an MTJ design with a free layer and two polarizers capable of computing the sigmoidal activation function and its gradient at the device level. This design enables both feedforward and backpropagation computations within a single device, extending neuromorphic computing frameworks previously explored in the literature by introducing the ability to perform backpropagation directly in hardware. Our algorithm implementation reveals two key findings: (i) the small discrepancies between the MTJ-generated curves and the exact software-generated curves have a negligible impact on the performance of the backpropagation algorithm, (ii) the device implementation is highly robust to inter-device variation and noise, and (iii) the proposed method effectively supports transfer learning and knowledge distillation. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the performance of an edge computing network using weights from a software-trained model implemented with our MTJ design. The results show a minimal loss of accuracy of only 0.1% for the Fashion MNIST dataset and 2% for the CIFAR-100 dataset compared to the original software implementation. These results highlight the potential of our MTJ design for compact, hardware-based neural networks in edge computing applications, particularly for transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Advancing Cyber Incident Timeline Analysis Through Rule Based AI and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timeline Analysis (TA) is a key part of Timeline Forensics (TF) in Digital Forensics (DF), focusing primarily on examining and analysing temporal digital artefacts such as timestamps, derived from event logs, file metadata, and other related data to correlate events resulting from cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological timeline. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently process the vast volume and variety of data acquired during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper presents a novel framework, GenDFIR, that combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to advance and automate the TA process. Our approach consists of two main stages (1) We use R-BAI to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then converted into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the help of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM consequently leverages its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident scenarios. To validate our framework, we evaluate GenDFIR performance, efficiency, and reliability using various metrics across synthetic cyber incident simulation scenarios. This paper presents a proof of concept, where the findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This novel approach highlights the power of Generative AI (GenAI), specifically LLMs, and opens new avenues for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, representing a significant step forward in the field.</description>

      <title>SoK: Bitcoin Layer Two (L2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on constructing Layer Two (L2) solutions for Bitcoin.
  We carefully examine a representative subset of ongoing Bitcoin L2 solutions (40 out of 335 extensively investigated cases) and provide a concise yet impactful identification of six classic design patterns through two approaches (i.e., modifying transactions \&amp; creating proofs). Notably, we are the first to incorporate the inscription technology (emerged in mid-2023), along with a series of related innovations. We further establish a reference framework that serves as a baseline criterion ideally suited for evaluating the security aspects of Bitcoin L2 solutions, and which can also be extended to broader L2 applications. We apply this framework to evaluate each of the projects we investigated.
  We find that the inscription-based approaches introduce new functionality (i.e., programability) to Bitcoin systems, whereas existing proof-based solutions primarily address scalability challenges. Our security analysis reveals new attack vectors targeting data/state (availability, verification), assets (withdrawal, recovery), and users (disputes, censorship).</description>

      <title>Enhancing 5G Performance: Reducing Service Time and Research Directions for 6G Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents several methods for minimizing packet service time in networks using 5G and beyond. We propose leveraging network coding alongside Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) to reduce service time as well as optimizing Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection based on the service time. Our network coding approach includes a method to increase the number of packets in flight, adhering to the current standard of the 16 HARQ process limit, demonstrating that these strategies can enhance throughput and reduce latency. Experimental results show that network coding reduces service times by up to 7% in low SNR regimes, with greater reduction across all SNR as the number of packets in flight increases, suggesting that future 6G standards should consider increasing the number of HARQ processes for better performance.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Inter-Core Qubit Traffic in Large-Scale Quantum Modular Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular quantum processor architectures are envisioned as a promising solution for the scalability of quantum computing systems beyond the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices era. Based upon interconnecting tens to hundreds of quantum cores via a quantum intranet, this approach unravels the pressing limitations of densely qubit-packed monolithic processors, mainly by mitigating the requirements of qubit control and enhancing qubit isolation, and therefore enables executing large-scale algorithms on quantum computers. In order to optimize such architectures, it is crucial to analyze the quantum state transfers occurring via inter-core communication networks, referred to as inter-core qubit traffic. This would also provide insights to improve the software and hardware stack for multi-core quantum computers. To this aim, we present a pioneering characterization of the spatio-temporal inter-core qubit traffic in large-scale circuits. The programs are executed on an all-to-all connected multi-core architecture that supports up to around 1000 qubits. We characterize the qubit traffic based on multiple performance metrics to assess the computational process and the communication overhead. Based on the showcased results, we conclude on the scalability of the presented algorithms, provide a set of guidelines to improve mapping quantum circuits to multi-core processors, and lay the foundations of benchmarking large-scale multi-core architectures.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02461v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. It facilitates effective AI training within sovereign data networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) extends the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) framework to address challenges in healthcare data sovereignty and AI utilization. Building upon DIN's core principles, DHIN introduces healthcare-specific components to tackle data fragmentation across providers and institutions, establishing a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision. It facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse health data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR), extending DIN's personal data stores concept to ensure health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, tailored for medical data; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism adapted from DIN to incentivize participation in healthcare AI development. DHIN operates on a public blockchain with an immutable record, ensuring that no entity can control access to health data or determine financial benefits. It supports effective AI training while allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized ecosystem. Unique to DHIN, patients receive rewards in digital wallets as an incentive to opt into the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to fund decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage, showcasing how DIN principles can transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>
