      <title>A global inverse-problem approach to quantitative photo-switching optoacoustic mesoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a global framework that includes a detailed model of the photo-switching and acoustic processes for photo-switching optoacoustic mesoscopy, based on the underlying physics. We efficiently implement two forward models as matrix-free linear operators and join them as one forward operator. Then, we reconstruct the concentration maps directly from the temporal series of acoustic signals through the resolution of one combined inverse problem. For robustness against noise and clean unmixing results, we adopt a hybrid regularization technique composed of the $l_1$ and total-variation regularizers applied to two different spaces. We use a proximal-gradient algorithm to solve the minimization problem. Our numerical results show that our regularized one-step approach is the most robust in terms of noise and experimental setup. It consistently achieves higher-quality images, as compared to two-step or unregularized methods.</description>

      <title>Addressing modulational instability in anti-resonant hollow-core fibers for pulse compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When pulses propagate in gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fibers (AR-HCFs) modulational instability (MI) can lead to pulse break-up and loss of coherence. In pulse broadening and compression schemes, MI is a parasitic effect that induces significant shot-to-shot fluctuations of the peak power of compressed pulses and increases rapidly over a narrow range of input pulse energies. In this work we use experimental studies and supporting numerical simulations to compare two AR-HCFs that are chosen to enhance or suppress MI. We demonstrate that judicious selection of the wall thickness of the anti-resonant elements (AREs) can drastically reduce the MI gain, thereby increasing the limit of pulse energy scaling of stable ultrafast pulse compression.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Reconstruction using Discrete LED-Structured Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the use of digital signal processing to reconstruct continuous reflectance spectra using a small finite set of randomly illuminated light emitting diodes (LEDs). We simulate the use of LEDs having identical spectral distance and Gaussian bandwidth whose illumination overlaps its nearest neighbors. An object, whose reflectance spectrum is to be determined, is illuminated by a series of random spectral patterns consisting of randomly chosen LEDs with random intensity. We quantify the information within the illumination patterns using the singular value decomposition (SVD) and reconstruct reflectance spectra, specifically hemoglobin and several green vegetation spectra using the pseudoinverse of the SVD for a given amount of noise. We show that for sparse plant spectra, it is possible to reconstruct the continuous green vegetation spectra with RMSE less than 1% with as few as 25 LEDs. Our study demonstrates that reconstructing sparse reflectance spectra based on random structured illumination can enable low-cost LED-based cameras to perform equally well as expensive cameras, especially for dedicated applications.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points and Lasing Thresholds: When Lower-Q Modes Win</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental questions in laser physics is the following: Which mode of an optical cavity will reach the lasing threshold first when gain is applied? Intuitively, the answer appears straightforward: When a particular mode is both temporally well confined (i.e., exhibits the highest quality factor) and experiences initially the largest increase of the modal gain, it is naturally expected to lase first. However, in this work, we demonstrate that this intuition can fail in surprising ways. Specifically, we show that in the presence of non-Hermitian degeneracies, known as exceptional points, the expected mode hierarchy can be dramatically altered. These spectral singularities can give rise to counterintuitive mode switching, where a mode with a lower quality factor and initially smaller increase of modal gain reaches the lasing threshold ahead of a more favorable competitor. Remarkably, this effect can occur even under spatially uniform pumping, underscoring the subtle and profound influence of non-Hermitian physics on lasing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared continua via spectral broadening and difference frequency generation in a nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically poled thin film lithium niobate waveguides provide simultaneous access to efficient second and third order nonlinear processes, enabling broadband generation of coherent laser light. Here, we demonstrate the generation of a broadband mid-infrared continuum in a nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguide pumped by a telecom-wavelength femtosecond source. Specifically, our dual-stage design includes both third-order nonlinear spectral broadening followed by a dedicated periodically poled waveguide section performing efficient broadband intrapulse difference frequency generation. Driven by sub-100 fs pulses with approximately 200 pJ pulse energy, the generated mid-infrared light covers wavelengths from 3200 to 4800 nm. Cascaded harmonic generation also extends the spectrum into the visible and ultraviolet domains, resulting in an overall spectral bandwidth ranging from 350 to 4800 nm.</description>

      <title>ME-FIRST: A Metasurface-Enhanced Fingerprint InfraRed Spectroscopic Tool for Fluid Analytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has emerged as a pivotal tool in biomedical diagnostics, offering label-free spectral biomarkers for the detection of numerous diseases, particularly in the fingerprint region. However, the lack of rapid and sensitive IR spectroscopic techniques for analyzing complex fluid analytes remains a critical challenge in clinical practice. To address this limitation, we present a Metasurface-Enhanced Fingerprint InfraRed Spectroscopic Tool (ME-FIRST) that enhances light-matter interactions in sub-wavelength volumes through plasmonic resonances across the entire fingerprint range from $1900 cm^{-1}$ to $1000 cm^{-1}$. Numerical simulations reveal confined and enhanced electric near-field, with an average probing depth of ~100 nm and enhancement factor $|E/E_0|$ of ~60-fold at resonant peaks. The ME-FIRST device is further experimentally fabricated and validated, and as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the sensing of molecular vibrational modes with a considerable sensitivity in L-lysine over the full fingerprint IR spectral range. The proposed ME-FIRST presents a promising platform for high-sensitivity IR spectroscopy of fluid analytes, paving the way for clinical applications of infrared spectroscopy in biofluid analysis and pathological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dual-Bus Resonator for Multi-Port Spectral Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microresonators are essential in integrated photonics, enabling optical filters, modulators, sensors, and frequency converters. Their spectral response is governed by bus-to-resonator coupling, typically classified as under-, critical-, or over-coupling. Conventional single-bus designs inevitably link the conditions for critical coupling, a transmission zero, and maximum intra-cavity power, preventing independent control of these phenomena and restricting the ability to engineer coupling regimes and resonance lineshapes. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a dual-bus racetrack resonator that breaks this constraint. Our design demonstrates complementary channel-specific coupling regimes and enables wavelength-dependent Lorentzian-to-Fano lineshaping. We model the device using three-waveguide coupled-mode theory and pole-zero analysis, which reveals that transmission zeros are decoupled from cavity-defined critical coupling and maximum intra-cavity power. Furthermore, the dual-bus scheme operates broadband, spanning visible to mid-infrared across all four transmission channels, highlighting its spectral richness and platform independence. These results establish a general framework for multi-port spectral engineering in integrated photonics, with broad implications for tunable filters, modulators, sensors, and nonlinear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging capabilities of incoherent diffractive imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensless X-ray imaging provides element-specific nanoscale insights into thick samples beyond the reach of conventional light and electron microscopy. Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) methods, such as ptychographic tomography, can recover three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale structures but require extensive sample rotation, adding complexity to experiments. X-ray elastic-scattering patterns from a single sample orientation are highly directional and provide limited 3D information about the structure. In contrast to X-ray elastic scattering, X-ray fluorescence is emitted mostly isotropically. However, first-order spatial coherence has traditionally limited nanoscale fluorescence imaging to single-crystalline samples. Here, we demonstrate that intensity correlations of X-ray fluorescence excited by ultrashort X-ray pulses contain 3D structural information of non-periodic, stationary objects. In our experiment, we illuminated a vanadium foil within a sub-200 nm X-ray laser beam focus. Without changing the sample orientation, we recorded 16 distinct specimen projections using detector regions covering different photon incidence angles relative to the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) beam. The projections varied systematically as the fluorescing volume was translated along an astigmatism, confirming that FEL-induced fluorescence reflects real-space structural changes. Our results establish a new approach for lensless 3D imaging of non-periodic specimens using fluorescence intensity correlations, with broad implications for materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Hot Carrier Relaxation and Coherent Phonon Dynamics in Type-II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique energy band and crystal structure of the layered type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 hold great promise for high-performance broadband anisotropic optoelectronic devices. Therefore, gaining an in-depth understanding of the interactions between internal microscopic particles is of vital importance. Here, we employ a two-color pump-probe system to reveal the anisotropic electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and coherent phonon dynamics in bulk TaIrTe4. The carrier relaxation exhibits a four-exponential decay process, with strong dependence on polarization of probe pulse, indicating that EPC strength is closely related to the crystal axes (a/b- axes). In addition, we observe three coherent phonon modes in bulk TaIrTe4: 38.5 GHz, 0.44 THz and 1.29 THz. Their oscillation amplitudes and dephasing times also show anisotropic responses to the probe polarization. We also investigate the in-plane cross-directional thermal conductivity coefficient of TaIrTe4 by beam-offset frequency-domain thermal reflection (FDTR). The thermal conductivity coefficient along the a-axis and b-axis directions are ka=14.4 W/mK and kb=3.8 W/mK, respectively. This represents a significant in-plane anisotropy. Our work not only reveals the key role of anisotropic EPC in controlling the thermal and optical properties of TaIrTe4, but also provides insights into designing polarization-sensitive optoelectronic devices based on topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Optimizing probes for multi-beam ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-beam ptychography (MBP) offers a scalable solution to improve the throughput of state-of-the-art ptychography by increasing the number of coherent beams that illuminate the sample simultaneously. However, increasing the number of beams in ptychography makes ptychographical reconstructions more challenging and less robust. It has been demonstrated that MBP reconstructions can be made more robust by using well-structured and mutually separable probes. Here, we present a quantitative framework to assess probe sets based on separability, uniformity, and fabrication feasibility. We show that Hadamard-based binary phase masks consistently outperform Zernike polynomials, experimentally feasible phase plates, and spiral phase masks across varying scan densities. While spiral masks yield comparable resolution, they scale less efficiently due to increased structural complexity. Our results establish practical criteria for evaluating and designing structured probes to enable more robust and scalable implementation of MBP in high-throughput coherent X-ray and EUV imaging.</description>

      <title>Two-step recording-development approaches in laser processing of materials. Photoinduced gold nanoparticles-carbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A short review on two-step laser processing of material is presented. The main focus is on the processes which can be called recording-development ones. Here, the first step of laser processing provides an initial pattern on the material surface, which is enhanced or developed at the second step. A new type of the recordingd-development process is considered. The first process is the UV third harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser initiated gold nanoparticle growth in a polystyrene film. A grating of 20-um period is recorded through the corresponding mask. The lines of the grating are of red color corresponding to the plasmon resonance absorption of gold nanoparticles. The second, development step is carbonization of the matrix just near the gold nanoparticles performed by homogeneous irradiation of the recorded pattern by the powerful radiation of the second harmonic of the same laser. As a result, a black carbonized grating is obtained. The patterns possessing both red and black parts are also presented, demonstrating the opportunity to combine within the same matrix the microstructures of nanocomposites of different kinds.</description>

      <title>Toward Photon-Induced Near-Field Electron Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New techniques for imaging electromagnetic near-fields in nanostructures drive advancements in nanotechnology, optoelectronics, materials science, and biochemistry. Most existing techniques probe near-fields along surfaces, lacking the ability to extract near-fields confined within the structure. Notable exceptions use free electrons to traverse through nanostructures, integrating the field along their trajectories, extracting 2D near-field projections rather than the complete field. Here, drawing inspiration from computed tomography (CT), we present a tomography concept providing full 3D reconstruction of vectorial time-harmonic near-fields. We develop a Radon-like algorithm incorporating the electron wave-nature and the time dependency of its interaction with vector fields. To show the prospects of electron near-field tomography, we propose and analyze its ability to resolve the sub-wavelength zigzag profile of highly confined hyperbolic polaritons and to reconstruct 3D phase singularities in a chiral near-field, raising exciting goals for next-generation experiments in ultrafast transmission electron microscopes.</description>

      <title>Topological protection of photon-pair generation in nonlinear waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing topological effects offers a promising route to protect quantum states of light from imperfections, potentially enabling more robust platforms for quantum information processing. This capability is particularly relevant for active photonic circuits that generate quantum light directly on-chip. Here, we explore topological effects on photon-pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear waveguide arrays, both theoretically and experimentally. A systematic comparison of homogeneous, trivial, and topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays reveals that only the topological configuration preserves a stable SPDC resonance spectrum under disorder in the tunnel couplings, with fluctuations in the resonance position reduced by more than one order of magnitude. An analytical model supports our experimental observations by linking this robustness to the band-structure properties of the interacting modes. These findings establish quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays as a promising platform to explore the interplay of nonlinearity, topology, and disorder in quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Predicting Wrist Osteoporosis from excised human finger bones using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy, A Cadaveric Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Osteoporosis and osteopenia remain vastly underdiagnosed. Current clinical screening relies almost exclusively on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which measures bone mineral density (BMD) but fails to capture the compositional changes that lead to BMD loss. We investigated whether Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) applied to excised finger bones can assess subsurface biochemical markers capable of diagnosing osteoporosis and osteopenia and predicting wrist DXA T-scores. Raman spectra were acquired ex vivo on the mid-shaft of the proximal phalanx of the second digit from 25 female cadavers spanning the three T-score categories (n=8 normal, n=6 osteopenic, and n=11 osteoporotic) at spatial offsets of 0, 3, and 6 mm from a laser irradiation spot. After normalizing spectra to the PO43- peak, group-averaged spectra of the three categories, measured at 3-mm offset, showed clear differences in the CO32-, Amide III, CH2, and Amide I bands. Quantitatively, four out of five mineral-to-matrix ratios differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) between normal and osteopenic bone, and between osteopenic and osteoporotic bone, and all five ratios showed significant differences between normal and osteoporotic bone. In contrast, the 0-mm offset suffered diminished contrast, and the 6-mm offset did not enhance discrimination between different groups, compared with the 3-mm offset. A leave-one-out, partial-least-squares regression model built from the 3-mm spectra predicted distal radius DXA T-score with a Pearson correlation of r = 0.85 and a root-mean-square error of cross-validation of 1 T-score units, correctly classifying 92% of specimens.</description>

Abstract: The development of extreme ultraviolet sources is critical for advancing angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a powerful technique for probing the electronic structure of materials. Here, we report the construction of a tabletop 10.8-eV femtosecond laser through cascaded third-harmonic generation, which operates at a repetition rate of 1 MHz and delivers a photon flux of approximately 1012 photons/s. The system achieves a high energy resolution of approximately 11.8 meV and tunable polarization. This flexibility enables detailed studies of orbitaland (pseudo)spin characteristics in quantum materials. We demonstrate the capabilities of this laser-ARPES system by investigating several prototypical materials, showcasing its potential for elucidating complex phenomena in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum evolution with classical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave guides for classical electromagnetic fields can realize the quantum evolution of the wave function for a system of qubits.
  Phase shifts, switches and beam splits allow for the construction of arbitrary quantum gates.
  They can act at once on a large number of qubits.
  For this correlation based photonic quantum computer the channels of the wave guides represent basis states of a multi-qubit system rather than individual qubits.
  The classical probabilistic implementation of a quantum evolution sheds new light on the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Spoofing resilience for simple-detection quantum illumination LIDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object detection and range finding using a weak light source is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks by an intruder. Quantum illumination with nonsimultaneous, phase-insensitive coincidence measurements can provide jamming resilience compared to identical measurements for classical illumination. We extend an experimentally-feasible object detection and range finding quantum illumination-based protocol to include spoofing resilience. This approach allows the system to be characterised by its experimental parameters and quantum states, rather than just its detector data. Therefore we can scope the parameter-space which provides some spoofing resilience without relying upon the prohibitive method of acquiring detector data for all combinations of the experimental parameters. We demonstrate that in certain regimes the intruder has an optimal relative detection basis angle to minimise the induced error. We also show that there are spoofing-vulnerable regimes where excessive background noise prevents any induced error, while it is still possible to perform object detection, i.e. our detectors have not been fully blinded. The sensing protocol which we describe can allow for the recognition of intrusion and the possible detection of our trustworthy return signal. Our results reinforce that quantum illumination is advantageous for spoofing resilience compared to a classical illumination-based protocol.</description>
