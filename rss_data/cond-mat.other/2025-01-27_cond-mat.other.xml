      <title>Anomalies in the electronic stopping of slow antiprotons in LiF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-principles theoretical calculations for the electronic stopping power (SP) of both protons and anti-protons in LiF. Our results show the presence of the Barkas effect: a higher stopping for positively charged particles than their negatively charged antiparticles. In contrast, a previous study has predicted an anti-Barkas effect (higher stopping for negative charges) at low velocity [Qi, Bruneval and Maliyov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 043401 (2022)]. We explain this discrepancy by showing that this anti-Barkas effect appears for highly symmetric trajectories and disappears when considering trajectories that better reproduce the experimental setup. Our low-velocity results show that the SP of both protons and anti-proton vanish for velocities under 0.1 a.u. .</description>

      <title>Origin of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ultra-thin metal films studied by in-situ neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays an important role in different spintronic devices. The rapid development of spintronics requires a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms of the PMA formation. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of studying PMA by in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry combined with pulsed laser deposition. Using these techniques, we show the formation of out-of-plane anisotropy in thin CoFeB films (1.8 nm) with a capping Mo layer. Investigating thick (5.3 nm}) and thin (0.5 nm) molybdenum films, we demonstrate that in both cases, PMA was established in bilayer structures without any thermal annealing. Also, we demonstrate how an additional silicon layer grown over the CoFeB/Mo bilayer can critically alter the magnetic properties of the sample. Such studies are possible only through the unique combination of the growth method with the in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry measurement technique. We believe that this approach will open up broad opportunities for the development and investigation of new spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 have provided a multiscale physics perspective based on Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between scale transformation by filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider that the spin angle momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the fluctuations at the microscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the fluctuations at the microscopic scale. In particular, the fluctuations can be reproduced at more macroscopic scales and amplified according to the size of kernel radius. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of cryogenic liquid helium4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity. In conclusion, we provide a new multiscale physical framework for cryogenic liquid helium-4.</description>

      <title>A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Centric Algorithm for Sample-Based Krylov Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>
