      <title>The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars. Over 75 000 Eclipsing and Ellipsoidal Binary Systems in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated collection of eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary systems in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), as observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. The catalog comprises a total of 75 400 binary systems, including 63 252 in the LMC and 12 148 in the SMC. The sample is categorized into 67 971 eclipsing and 7429 ellipsoidal variables. For all stars, we provide I-band and V-band photometric time series collected between 2010 and 2024 during the fourth phase of the OGLE project (OGLE-IV). We discuss methods used to identify binary systems in the OGLE data and present objects of particular interest, including double periodic variables, transient eclipsing binaries, double eclipsing binaries, and binary systems with pulsating stars. We present a comparative analysis based on the most comprehensive catalogs of variable stars in the Magellanic System, compiled from surveys like Gaia, ASAS-SN, and EROS-2, and included in the International Variable Star Index.</description>

      <title>A Homogeneous Catalog of Oscillating Solar-Type Stars Observed by the Kepler Mission and a New Amplitude Scaling Relation Including Chromospheric Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous catalog of global asteroseismic parameters and derived stellar parameters for 765 Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars. The catalog was produced by re-analyzing all available Kepler DR25 short-cadence data using pySYD, an automated pipeline to extract global asteroseismic parameters. We find 50 new detections, seven of which are also planet candidate host stars. We find excellent agreement between our $\nu_{\text{max}}$ and $\Delta \nu$ measurements and literature values, with an average offset of $0.2 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=5\%$) and $0.2 \pm 0.7\%$ ($\sigma=2\%$), respectively. In addition, we derive stellar radii and masses with an average precision of $2.7\%$ and $10.4\%$, respectively, and find a median offset of $0.4 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=10\%$) between our radii derived with asteroseismology and those from Gaia parallaxes. Using spectroscopic $\log{R'_{\text{HK}}}$ activity measurements from Keck/HIRES, we derive a new amplitude scaling relation with an activity term for main-sequence and subgiant stars, which reduces the offset between expected and observed oscillation amplitudes from $9.3 \pm 1.6\%$ to $1.7 \pm 0.9\%$. Our work is the largest and most homogeneous asteroseismic catalog of Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars to date, including a total of 101 stars hosting planet candidates and 451 stars with measured rotation periods.</description>

      <title>Simulating Chemical Abundances in the Circumstellar Nebula of the Late Stage Binary RY Scuti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RY Scuti, thought to be a Wolf-Rayet (WR) progenitor, is a massive, post-main-sequence, binary star system undergoing Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). SOFIA (+FORCAST) spectroscopy of the inner, ionized region of RY Scuti's double ringed toroidal nebula affirms the previous detection of the well-studied 12.81 $\mu$m Ne II forbidden transition and reveals four distinct emission lines, including three previously undetected transitions, S III, Fe III, and S III. Cloudy photoionization modeling of the four neon, sulfur, and iron lines was performed to derive fractional abundances (log($\frac{X}{H}$)) of neon at -3.19 $\pm$ 0.0251, sulfur at -3.76 $\pm$ 0.0487, and iron at -2.23 $\pm$ 0.0286. All three species are overabundant with respect to fiducial solar chemical abundances, especially iron. Our analysis suggests that the outer envelope of the primary star in the RY Scuti system is being stripped away via RLOF, leaving helium-rich and hydrogen-poor material visible to observation. This material also exhibits elevated neon, sulfur, and iron fractional abundances, consistent with RY Scuti evolving toward a WR object.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Classical Be Star Outbursts: A Multi-Epoch Study of the Be system EPIC 202060631</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through cross-matching the ASASSN photometric light curves and LAMOST spectroscopic observations, we serendipitously captured a rare major outburst event from the Be star EPIC 202060631, lasting over 1000 days. Fortuitously, the LAMOST ow-resolution spectra densely covered the flux rising stage with 20 epochs, while an additional 7 low-resolution and 11 medium esolution spectra monitored the subsequent decay phase. Moreover, this target was observed by Kepler telescope in its K2 mission when before the outburst and by TESS telescope while after returning to quiescence. Analyses of these datasets reveal pulsation behavior and mode amplitudes, indications of radial and tangential motions in the photosphere, and clear evidence of mass ejection and circumstellar disk formation. We modeled the central star using the BRUCE04 code and analyzed the disk structure using HDUST. Our results suggest episodic mass injection events from the central star triggered the disk buildup and carried imprints of the changing stellar pulsations. This study offers unique insights into the connections between photospheric activities, disk evolution, and stellar rotation during Be star outbursts.</description>

      <title>Velocity and Density Fluctuations in the Quiet Sun Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties and relationship between Doppler-velocity fluctuations and intensity fluctuations in the off-limb quiet Sun corona. These are expected to reflect the properties of Alfvenic and compressive waves, respectively. The data come from the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (COMP). These data were studied using spectral methods to estimate the power spectra, amplitudes, perpendicular correlation lengths, phases, trajectories, dispersion relations, and propagation speeds of both types of fluctuations. We find that most velocity fluctuations are due to Alfvenic waves, but that intensity fluctuations come from a variety of sources, likely including fast and slow mode waves, as well as aperiodic variations. The relation between the velocity and intensity fluctuations differs depending on the underlying coronal structure. On short closed loops, the velocity and intensity fluctuations have similar power spectra and speeds. In contrast, on longer nearly radial trajectories, the velocity and intensity fluctuations have different power spectra, with the velocity fluctuations propagating at much faster speeds than the intensity fluctuations. Considering the temperature sensitivity of COMP, these longer structures are more likely to be closed fields lines of the quiet Sun rather than cooler open field lines. That is, we find the character of the interactions of Alfvenic waves and density fluctuations depends on the length of the magnetic loop on which they are traveling.</description>

      <title>Pulsations and Pre-He White Dwarf in the Post-mass Transfer Eclipsing System WASP 1021-28</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from VLT/UVES spectra and TESS photometric observations of the pulsating EL CVn binary WASP 1021-28, containing a He-core white dwarf precursor (pre-He WD). Double-lined radial velocities were measured with the atmospheric parameters of $T_{\rm eff,A}$ = 7411$\pm40$ K, [M/H] = 0.34$\pm$0.05 dex, and $v_{\rm A}$$\sin i$ = 86.6$\pm$4.0 km s$^{-1}$ for the more massive primary. Combining these measurements and TESS data from four sectors allowed the direct calculation of accurate values for the absolute parameters of each component and the distance to the system. The third-light source of $l_3$ = 0.029 may be the outer tertiary object previously discovered by SPHERE/IRDIS observations. WASP 1021-28 A is located near the blue edge of the $\gamma$ Dor instability strip, and the less massive companion is concurrent with the He-core WD model for metallicity $Z$ = 0.02 and mass $M$ = 0.191 $M_\odot$. The $Z$ value and the Galactic kinematics demonstrate that the program target belongs to the thin-disk population. We iteratively prewhitened the entire TESS residuals and extracted four and nine significant signals in two ranges of 1.12$-$2.25 day$^{-1}$ and 111.25$-$139.24 day$^{-1}$, respectively. A signal of $f_2$ = 1.31865 day$^{-1}$ in the low-frequency region can be attributed to the $\gamma$ Dor pulsation of WASP 1021-28 A, and the high frequencies may be extremely low-mass pre-He WD oscillations. The results presented here provide valuable information on the evolution of short-period EL CVn stars proposed as inner binaries of hierarchical triple systems and the multiperiodic pulsations.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Energy Release Events in the Quiet Sun: A Possible Source for Coronal Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal heating problem remains one of the most challenging questions in solar physics. The energy driving coronal heating is widely understood to be associated with convective motions below the photosphere. Recent high-resolution observations reveal that photospheric magnetic fields in the quiet Sun undergo complex and rapid evolution. These photospheric dynamics are expected to be reflected in the coronal magnetic field. Motivated by these insights, our research aims to explore the relationship between magnetic energy and coronal heating. By combining observations from Solar Orbiter and SDO with a magnetic field extrapolation technique, we estimate the magnetic free energy of multi-scale energy release events in the quiet Sun. Interestingly, our results reveal a strong correlation between the evolution of free energy and the integrated intensity of extreme ultraviolet emission at 171 \AA~in these events. We quantitatively assess the potential energy flux budget of these events to evaluate their contribution to coronal heating. Our study implies a link between photospheric magnetic field evolution and coronal temperature variations, paving the way for further research into similar phenomena.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the SATIRE-S irradiance reconstruction: Heritage of Mt Wilson magnetograms and Ca II K observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate information on long-term variations in solar irradiance, important for understanding the solar influence on Earth's climate, cannot be derived from direct irradiance measurements due to the comparatively short lifetimes of space-borne experiments. Models using measurements of the solar photospheric magnetic field as input can provide an independent assessment of the changes. The SATIRE-S model does just that. Unfortunately, the magnetogram archives used by SATIRE-S to recover irradiance variations are also relatively short-lived and have short mutual overlapping periods, making it difficult to evaluate their consistency. We improve SATIRE-S total solar irradiance (TSI) reconstruction by firstly incorporating magnetograms from the Mt Wilson Observatory as well as unsigned magnetograms reconstructed from Meudon, Rome, and San Fernando Ca II K data, and secondly, by re-analysing all periods of overlaps between the various archives. Our combined daily irradiance reconstruction from all eight input archives returns an excellent agreement with direct measurements of irradiance, in particular we find a correlation coefficient of 0.98 when comparing to TSIS1/TIM (Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor Total Irradiance Monitor) data. The minimum-to-minimum TSI difference between 1976 and 2019 is -0.2$\pm0.17$~Wm$^{-2}$, while the TSI difference between the 1986 and 2019 minima is statistically insignificant (-0.06$\pm0.13$~Wm$^{-2}$). Our analysis also sheds light on the trend shown by the TSI over the so-called ACRIM gap, disfavouring a hypothesised increasing trend in TSI in that period. By including more direct and indirect magnetogram time series, we have made the TSI reconstructed by SATIRE-S more robust and accurate. The new series shows a reduced trend of decreasing TSI over the last half century, which agrees well with most composites of measured TSI.</description>

      <title>The theoretical pulsation spectra of hot B subdwarfs. Static and evolutionary STELUM models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Kepler and TESS space missions have revealed the rich gravity (g-)mode pulsation spectra of many hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars in detail. These spectra exhibit complex behaviors, with some stars exhibiting trapped modes interposing in the asymptotic period sequences of regular period spacing, while others do not. Methods. We used our STELlar modeling from the Universite de Montreal (STELUM) code to compute static (parametric) and evolutionary models of sdB stars, with different prescriptions for their chemical and thermal structures. We used our adiabatic PULSE code to compute the theoretical spectra of g-mode pulsations for degrees of l=1 to 4 and for periods between 1000 s and 15 000 s, amply covering the range of observed g-modes in these stars. Results. We show that g-mode pulsation spectra and, in particular, the appearance of trapped modes are highly dependent on the chemical and thermal structures in the models as the star evolves, particularly in the region just above the He-burning core. Depending on the prescriptions and specific evolutionary stage, we observe mainly three types of spectra for mid to high radial-order g-modes (the ones observed in sdB stars): flat spectra of nearly constant period spacing; spectra with deep minima of the period spacing interposing between modes with more regular spacing (which correspond to trapped modes); and spectra showing a wavy pattern in period spacing. For the two latter cases, we have identified the region where the modes are trapped in the star. Conclusions. Detailed comparisons with observed g-mode spectra ought to be carried out next to progress on this issue and constrain the internal structure of core-He burning stars via asteroseismology, in particular, for the region above the He-burning core.</description>

      <title>Evolution of binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars are pairs of stars that are gravitationally bound, providing in some cases accurate measurements of their masses and radii. As such, they serve as excellent testbeds for the theory of stellar structure and evolution. Moreover, binary stars that orbit each other at a sufficiently small distance will interact during their lifetimes, leading to a multitude of different evolutionary pathways that are not present in single star evolution. Among other outcomes, this can lead to the production of stellar mergers, rejuvenated and chemically contaminated accreting stars, stars stripped of their hydrogen envelopes and gravitational wave sources. For stars massive enough to undergo a supernova, binary interaction is expected to impact the evolution of most of them, making the understanding of binary evolution a critical element to comprehend stellar populations and their impact at large scales.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Morphology of Late-phase Stellar Flares From G-, K-, and M-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares occasionally present a $\textit{peak-bump}$ light curve morphology, consisting of an initial impulsive phase followed by a gradual late phase. Analyzing this specific morphology can uncover the underlying physics of stellar flare dynamics, particularly the plasma heating-evaporation-condensation process. While previous studies have mainly examined peak-bump occurrences on M-dwarfs, this report extends the investigation to G-, K-, and M-type stars. We utilize the flare catalog published by arXiv:2212.00993, encompassing 12,597 flares, detected by using $\textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite}$ (TESS) observations. Our analysis identifies 10,142 flares with discernible classical and complex morphology, of which 197 ($\sim1.9\%$) exhibit the peak-bump feature. We delve into the statistical properties of these TESS late-phase flares, noting that both the amplitude and full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) duration of both the peaks and bumps show positive correlations across all source-star spectral types, following a power law with indices 0.69 $\pm$ 0.09 and 1.0 $\pm$ 0.15, respectively. Additionally, a negative correlation between flare amplitude and the effective temperature of their host stars is observed. Compared to the other flares in our sample, peak-bump flares tend to have larger and longer initial peak amplitudes and FWHM durations, and possess energies ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{36}$ erg.</description>

      <title>Resolution of a paradox: SDSS J1257+5428 can be explained as a descendant of a cataclysmic variable with an evolved donor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of the binary system SDSS J1257+5428 has been described as paradoxical. Here we investigate under which conditions SDSS J1257+5428 could be understood as a descendant of a cataclysmic variable with an evolved donor star, which is a scenario that has never been explored in detail. We used the BSE code for pre-common-envelope (CE) evolution and the MESA code for post-CE evolution to run binary evolution simulations and searched for potential formation pathways for SDSS J1257+5428 that lead to its observed characteristics. For the post-CE evolution, we adopted a boosted version of the CARB model. We find that SDSS J1257+5428 can be explained as a post-cataclysmic-variable system if (i) the progenitor of the extremely low-mass WD was initially a solar-type star that evolved into a subgiant before the onset of mass transfer and underwent hydrogen shell flashes after the mass transfer stopped, (ii) the massive WD was highly or entirely rejuvenated during the cataclysmic variable evolution, and (iii) magnetic braking was strong enough to make the evolution convergent. In this case, the torques due to magnetic braking need to be stronger than those provided by the CARB model by a factor of ${\sim100}$. We conclude that SDSS J1257+5428 can be reasonably well explained as having originated from a cataclysmic variable that hosted an evolved donor star and should no longer be regarded as paradoxical. If our formation channel is correct, our findings provide further support that stronger magnetic braking acts on progenitors of (i) close detached WD binaries, (ii) close detached millisecond pulsar with extremely low-mass WDs, (iii) AM CVn binaries, and (iv) ultra-compact X-ray binaries, in comparison to the magnetic braking strength required to explain binaries hosting main-sequence stars and single main-sequence stars.</description>

      <title>Localized Heating and Dynamics of the Solar Corona due to a Symbiosis of Waves and Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, is maintained at mega-Kelvin temperatures and fills the heliosphere with a supersonic outflowing wind. The dissipation of magnetic waves and direct electric currents are likely to be the most significant processes for heating the corona, but a lively debate exists on their relative roles. Here, we suggest that the two are often intrinsically linked, since magnetic waves may trigger current dissipation, and impulsive reconnection can launch magnetic waves. We present a study of the first of these processes by using a 2D physics-based numerical simulation using the Adaptive Mesh Refined (AMR) Versatile Advection Code (VAC). Magnetic waves such as fast magnetoacoustic waves are often observed to propagate in the large-scale corona and interact with local magnetic structures. The present numerical simulations show how the propagation of magnetic disturbances towards a null point or separator can lead to the accumulation of the electric currents. Lorentz forces can laterally push and vertically stretch the magnetic fields, forming a current sheet with a strong magnetic-field gradient. The magnetic field lines then break and reconnect, and so contribute towards coronal heating. Numerical results are presented that support these ideas and support the concept of a symbiosis between waves and reconnection in heating the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Linking Photometry and spectroscopy: profiling multiple populations in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) largely comes from photometry and spectroscopy: appropriate photometric diagrams can disentangle first and second populations (1P and 2P)-1P having chemical signatures similar to field stars, and 2P stars showing unique light-element variations-while spectroscopy enables detailed chemical abundances analyses of these populations. We combine multi-band photometry with extensive spectroscopic data to investigate the chemical composition of multiple populations across 38 GCs, yielding a chemical abundance dataset for stars with precise population tagging. This dataset provides the most extensive analysis of C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al variations, revealing the largest sample yet of light-element spreads across GCs. GC mass correlates with light-element variations, supporting earlier photometric studies. We investigated iron differences among 1P stars, confirming their presence in 19 GCs, and finding a spread consistent with prediction based on photometry. Notably, in eight of them we detected a correlation between [Fe/H] and the position in iron-sensitive photometric diagrams. More massive GCs display larger lithium depletion among 2P stars, which is consistent with zero at smaller masses. Notably, some 2P stars with the most extreme chemical differences compared to 1P stars still show Li comparable to 1P, suggesting that the 1P polluters have produced some amount of this element. We analyzed the anomalous stars, a population characterized by enrichment in iron, s-process elements, and C+N+O, in ten GCs. NGC1851, NGC5139, NGC6656, and NGC 6715 display light-element inhomogeneities similar to 1P and 2P stars. Iron and barium enrichment varies widely-negligible in some clusters and much larger than errors in others. Generally, these elemental spreads correlate with GC mass.</description>

      <title>Subaru Hyper-Supreme Cam observations of IC 1396: Source catalogue, member population, and sub-clusters of the complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To identify member populations of IC 1396, we employ the random forest (RF) classifier of machine learning technique. Random forest classifier is an ensemble of individual decision trees suitable for large, high-dimensional datasets. The training set used in this work is derived from previous Gaia-based studies, where the member stars are younger than $\sim$ 10~Myr. However, its sensitivity is limited to $\sim$ 20~mag in the $\rm r_2$ band, making it challenging to identify candidates at the fainter end. In this analysis, in addition to magnitudes and colours, we incorporate several derived parameters from the magnitude and colour of the sources to identify candidate members of the star-forming complex. By employing this method, we are able to identify promising candidate member populations of the star-forming complex. We discuss the associated limitations and caveats in the method and for improvment in future studies.
  In this analysis, we identify 2425 high-probability low-mass stars distributed within the entire star-forming complex, of which 1331 are new detections. Comparison of these identified member populations shows a high retrieval rate with Gaia-based literature sources, as well as sources detected through methods based on optical spectroscopy, Spitzer, $\rm H_{\alpha}/X-ray$ emissions, optical, and 2MASS photometry. The mean age of the member populations is $\rm \sim 2-4~Myr$, consistent with findings from previous studies. Considering the identified member populations, we present preliminary results by exploring the presence of sub-clusters within IC 1396, assessing the possible mass limit of the member populations, and providing a brief discussion on the star formation history of the complex.</description>

      <title>The role of absorption and scattering in shaping ice bands. Spatially-resolved spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope now enables the spectral study of ices with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. Water ice plays a crucial role in the growth of grains and in planetary formation but its spatial distribution in protoplanetary disks is poorly constrained. To help the interpretation of future observations, we study here for the first time how the water ice band depends on the observer's perspective and the location where spectra are measured within protoplanetary disks. Based on a standard protoplanetary disk model around a T Tauri star, we used the radiative transfer code MCFOST to extract water-ice spectra and to measure the depth and central wavelength of the water-ice band at different locations in the disk. Even in the context of a spatially homogeneous ice mixture, the observed properties of water-ice bands depend on the inclination of the system as well as on the location in the disk from which the spectra are extracted. In particular, the wavelength of the band minimum can change by up to 0.17 {\mu}m comparable to the difference expected between amorphous and crystalline ices, for instance. This phenomenon stems from a balance between absorption and scattering and must be taken into account in detailed modeling of spatially-resolved infrared spectroscopy of ices, including CO and CO2.</description>

      <title>On the spatial distribution of luminous blue variables in the M33 galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current paper, we present a study of the spatial distribution of luminous blue variables (LBVs) and various LBV candidates (cLBVs) with respect to OB associations in the M33 galaxy. The identification of blue star groups was based on the LGGS data and was carried out by two clustering algorithms with initial parameters determined during simulations of random stellar fields. We have found that the distribution of distances to the nearest OB association obtained for the LBV/cLBV sample is close to that for massive stars with $M_{\rm init}&gt;20\,M_\odot$ and Wolf-Rayet stars. This result is in good agreement with the standard assumption that luminous blue variables represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of the most massive stars. However, some objects from the LBV/cLBV sample, particularly Fe$\,$II-emission stars, demonstrated severe isolation compared to other massive stars, which, together with certain features of their spectra, implicitly indicates that the nature of these objects and other LBVs/cLBVs may differ radically.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>A new mass estimate method with hydrodynamical atmospheres for very massive WNh stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.</description>

      <title>How the CME on 21 April 2023 Triggered the First Severe Geomagnetic Storm of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first severe (G4) geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 25 occurred on 23-24 April 2023, following the arrival of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on 23 April. The characteristics of this CME, measured from coronagraphs (speed and mass), did not indicate that it would trigger such an intense geomagnetic storm. In this work, our aim is to understand why this CME led to such a geoeffective outcome. Our analysis spans from the source active region to the corona and inner heliosphere through 1 au using multiwavelength, multi-viewpoint remote sensing observations and in situ data. We find that rotation and possibly deflection of the CME resulted in an axial magnetic field nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane during the Earth encounter, which might explain the storm's severity. Additionally, we find that imaging away from the Sun-Earth line is crucial in hindcasting the CME Time-of-Arrival at Earth. The position (0.39 au) and detailed images from the SoloHI telescope onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, in combination with SOHO and STEREO images, helped decisively with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CME.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. V. Clustered Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $\sim8-40\,\mu$m SOFIA-FORCAST images of seven regions of ``clustered" star formation as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. We identify a total of 34 protostar candidates and build their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We fit these SEDs with a grid of radiative transfer models based on the Turbulent Core Accretion (TCA) theory to derive key protostellar properties, including initial core mass, $M_c$, clump environment mass surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and current protostellar mass, $m_*$. We also carry out empirical graybody (GB) estimation of $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, which allows a case of restricted SED fitting within the TCA model grid. We also release version 2.0 of the open-source Python package \emph{sedcreator}, designed to automate the aperture photometry and SED building and fitting process for sources in clustered environments, where flux contamination from close neighbors typically complicates the process. Using these updated methods, SED fitting yields values of $M_c\sim30-200\:M_{\odot}$, $\Sigma_{\text{cl,SED}}\sim0.1-3\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$, and $m_*\sim4-50\:M_{\odot}$. The graybody fitting yields smaller values of $\Sigma_{\text{cl,GB}}\lesssim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$. From these results, we do not find evidence for a critical $\Sigma_{\rm{cl}}$ needed to form massive ($\gtrsim 8\:M_\odot$) stars. However, we do find tentative evidence for a dearth of the most massive ($m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$) protostars in the clustered regions suggesting a potential impact of environment on the stellar initial mass function.</description>

      <title>SpecDis: Value added distance catalogue for 4 million stars from DESI Year-1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the SpecDis value added stellar distance catalogue accompanying DESI DR1. SpecDis trains a feed-forward Neural Network (NN) on a large sample of stars with Gaia parallaxes, but without applying selections on parallax error or signal-to-noise (S/N) of the stellar spectra. We incorporate parallax error into the loss function for training. This approach ensures the training sample not suffering from biases. Moreover, SpecDis predicts the reciprocal of the square root of luminosity, which is linearly proportional to parallax and helps to avoid excluding negative parallaxes. To enhance the precision of distance predictions, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the noise and dimensionality of stellar spectra. Validated by independent external samples of member stars with precise distances from globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and stellar streams, combined with BHB stars, we demonstrate that our distance measurements show no significant bias up to 100 kpc, and are much more precise than Gaia parallax beyond 7 kpc. The median distance uncertainties are 23 %, 19 %, 11 % and 7 % for S/N$&lt;$20, 20$\leq$S/N$&lt;$ 60, 60$\leq$ S/N $&lt;$ 100 and S/N$\geq$100. Selecting stars with $\log g&lt;3.8$ and distance uncertainties smaller than 25 %, we have more than 74,000 giant candidates within 50 kpc to the Galactic center and 1,500 candidates beyond this distance. Additionally, we develop a Gaussian mixture model to identify binaries and identify 120,000 possible binaries, and discover that the binary fraction increases with [Fe/H] and $\log g$ and declines with [$\alpha$/Fe] and $T_\mathrm{eff}$, indicating stars with low Fe and high $\alpha$, which form early, may have experienced more encounters and tidal effects to disrupt binaries. Our final catalogue provides distances and distance uncertainties for $&gt;$4 million stars, offering a valuable resource for Galactic astronomy.</description>

      <title>The nebular spectra of SN 2023ixf: A lower mass, partially stripped progenitor may be the result of binary interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the brightest Core Collapse Supernovae of the 21st century and offers a rare opportunity to investigate the late stage of a Supernova through nebular phase spectroscopy. We present four nebular phase spectra from day +291 to +413 after explosion. This is supplemented with high cadence early phase spectroscopic observations and photometry covering the first 500 days to investigate explosion parameters. The narrow and blue-shifted nebular Oxygen emission lines are used to infer an ejected Oxygen mass of $&lt;0.65M_\odot$, consistent with models of a relatively low mass ($M_{ZAMS}&lt;15M_\odot$) progenitor. An energy of 0.3 to $1.4 \times10^{51}$ erg and a light curve powered by an initial $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.049 \pm 0.005 M_\odot$ appear consistent with a relatively standard Type II explosion, while an incomplete $\gamma$-ray trapping (with timescale of $240\pm4$ days) suggests a lower ejecta mass. Assuming a typical explosion, the broad Hydrogen and Calcium profiles suggest a common origin within a lower mass, partially stripped envelope. Hydrogen emission broadens with time, indicating contribution from an additional power source at an extended distance; while the emergence of high velocity ($\sim$6,000 km s$^{-1}$) Hydrogen emission features (beginning around day +200) may be explained by Shock Interaction with a dense Hydrogen-rich region located at $\sim1.5 \times 10^{16}$cm. Such envelope mass loss for a low mass progenitor may be explained through theoretical models of Binary interaction.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Stellar Flares on the Atmospheric Escape of Exoplanets orbiting M stars I: Insights from the AU Mic System</title>

Abstract: The X-rays and Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) emission from M stars can drive the atmospheric escape on planets orbiting them. M stars are also known for their frequent emission of stellar flares, which will increase the high-energy flux received by their orbiting planets. To understand how stellar flares impact the primordial atmospheres of planets orbiting young M stars, we use UV spectroscopic data of flares from the Habitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time (HAZMAT) and Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) programs as a proxy to the XUV flare emission. Using the software package VPLanet, we simulate the young AU Mic planetary system composed of two Neptune-sized and one Earth-sized planet orbiting a 23-Myr-old M1 star. Our findings show that the Earth-sized planet AU Mic d should be in the process of losing completely its atmosphere in the next couple million years, solely due to the quiescent emission, with flares not significantly contributing to its atmospheric escape due to the small size of AU mic d and its close-in distance from the star. However, our results indicate that flares would play a crucial role for such planets further away, in the habitable zone (i.e. 0.2935 AU) of AU Mic-like stars during the post-saturation phase, accelerating the total atmospheric loss process by a few billion years. For planets between 0.365 AU and the HZ outer edge, the additional XUV from flares is necessary to deplete primordial atmospheres fully since the quiescent emission alone is insufficient.</description>

      <title>A method of Extracting Flat Field from Real Time Solar Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for obtaining flat field rely on observed data collected under specific observation conditions to determine the flat field. However, the telescope pointing and the column fixed pattern noise of the CMOS detector change during actual observations, causing residual signals in real time observation data after flat field correction, such as interference fringes and column fixed pattern noise. In actual observations, the slight wobble of the telescope caused by the wind leads to shifts in the observed data. In this paper, a method of extracting the flat field from the real time solar observation data is proposed. Firstly, the average flat field obtained by multi-frame averaging is used as the initial value. A set of real-time observation data is input into the KLL method to calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. Secondly, the average flat field is corrected using the calculated correction amount to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. To overcome the residual solar structures caused by atmospheric turbulence in the correction amount, real-time observation data are grouped to calculate the correction amounts. These residual solar structures are suppressed by averaging multiple groups, improving the accuracy of the correction amount. The test results from space and ground-based simulated data demonstrate that our method can effectively calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. The NVST 10830 A/Ha data were also tested. High-resolution reconstruction confirms that the correction amount effectively corrects the average flat field to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. Our method works for chromosphere and photosphere data.</description>

      <title>Fine-tunings in nucleosynthesis and the emergence of life: Status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>
