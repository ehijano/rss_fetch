      <title>Determining a credit transition matrix from cumulative default probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To quantify the changes in the credit rating of a bond is an important mathematical problem for the credit rating industry. To think of the credit rating as the state a Markov chain is an interesting proposal leading to challenges in mathematical modeling. Since cumulative default rates are more readily measurable than credit migrations, a natural question is whether the credit transition matrix (CTM) can be determined from the knowledge of the cumulative default probabilities.
  Here we use a connection between the CTM and the cumulative default probabilities to setup an ill-posed, linear inverse problem with box constraints, which we solve by an entropy minimization procedure. This approach is interesting on several counts. On the one hand, we may have less data that unknowns, and on the other hand, even when we have as much data as unknowns, the matrix connecting them may not be invertible, which makes the problem ill-posed.
  Besides developing the tools to solve the problem, we apply it to several test cases to check the performance of the method. The results are quite satisfactory.</description>

      <title>Decoding Financial Health in Kenyas' Medical Insurance Sector: A Data-Driven Cluster Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines insurance companies' financial performance and reporting trends within the medical sector using advanced clustering techniques to identify distinct patterns. Four clusters were identified by analyzing financial ratios and time series data, each representing unique financial performance and reporting consistency combinations. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and KMeans clustering were employed to capture temporal variations and uncover key insights into company behaviors. The findings reveal that resilient performers consistently report and have financial stability, making them reliable options for policyholders. In contrast, clusters of underperforming companies and those with reporting gaps highlight operational challenges and issues related to data consistency. These insights emphasize the importance of transparency and timely reporting to ensure the sector's resilience. This study contributes to the literature by integrating time series analysis into financial clustering, offering practical recommendations for improving data governance and financial stability in the insurance sector. Future research could further investigate non-financial indicators and explore alternative clustering methods to provide a deeper understanding of performance dynamics.</description>
