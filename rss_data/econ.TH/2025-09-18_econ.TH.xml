      <title>Strategic Pricing and Ranking in Recommendation Systems with Seller Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a recommendation system where sellers compete for visibility by strategically offering commissions to a platform that optimally curates a ranked menu of items and their respective prices for each customer. Customers interact sequentially with the menu following a cascade click model, and their purchase decisions are influenced by price sensitivity and positions of various items in the menu. We model the seller-platform interaction as a Stackelberg game with sellers as leaders and consider two different games depending on whether the prices are set by the platform or prefixed by the sellers. It is complicated to find the optimal policy of the platform in complete generality; hence, we solve the problem in an important asymptotic regime.
  The core contribution of this paper lies in characterizing the equilibrium structure of the limit game. We show that when sellers are of different strengths, the standard Nash equilibrium does not exist due to discontinuities in utilities. We instead establish the existence of a novel equilibrium solution, namely `$\mu$-connected equilibrium cycle' ($\mu$-EC), which captures oscillatory strategic responses at the equilibrium. Unlike the (pure) Nash equilibrium, which defines a fixed point of mutual best responses, this is a set-valued solution concept of connected components. This novel equilibrium concept identifies a Cartesian product set of connected action profiles in the continuous action space that satisfies four important properties: stability against external deviations, no external chains, instability against internal deviations, and minimality. We extend a recently introduced solution concept equilibrium cycle to include stability against measure-zero violations and, by avoiding topological difficulties to propose $\mu$-EC.</description>

      <title>Efficient Major Transition Exchange under Distributional and Dual Priority-respecting Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real matching markets encounter distributional and fairness constraints. Motivated by the Chinese Major Transition Program (CMT), this paper studies the design of exchange mechanisms within a fresh framework of both distributional and dual priority-respecting constraints. Specifically, each student has an initial assigned major and applies to transfer to a more desirable one. A student can successfully transfer majors only if they obtain eligibility from both their initial major and the applied major. Each major has a dual priority: a strict priority over current students who wish to transfer out and a strict priority over students from other majors who wish to transfer in. Additionally, each major faces a ceiling constraint and a floor constraint to regulate student distribution. We show that the existing mechanisms of CMT result in avoidable inefficiencies, and propose two mechanisms that can match students to majors in an efficient way as well as respecting each major's distributional and dual priority. The efficient mechanisms are based on a proposed solution concept: eligibility maximization (EM), and two processes for identifying improvement cycles--specifically, transfer-in exchangeable cycles and transfer-out exchangeable cycles.</description>

      <title>Land and Infinite Debt Rollover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since McCallum (1987), it is well known that in an overlapping generations (OLG) economy with land, the equilibrium is Pareto efficient because with balanced growth, the interest rate exceeds the economic growth rate ($R&gt;G$), which rules out infinite debt rollover (a Ponzi scheme). We show that once we remove knife-edge restrictions on the production function and allow unbalanced growth, under some conditions an efficient equilibrium with land bubbles necessarily emerges and infinite debt rollover becomes possible, which is a markedly different insight from the conventional view derived from the Diamond (1965) landless economy. We also examine the possibility of Pareto inefficient equilibria.</description>

      <title>The infinite information gap between mathematical and physical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial orders have been used to model several experimental setups, going from classical thermodynamics and general relativity to the quantum realm with its resource theories. In order to study such experimental setups, one typically characterizes them via a (numerical) representation, that is, a set of real-valued functions. In the context of resource theory, it is customary to use \textbf{mathematical} representations, i.e. a set of \textbf{measurement outcomes} which characterize the achievable transitions within the experimental setup. However, in line with the minimum energy and maximum entropy principles in classical mechanics and thermodynamics, respectively, one would expect an optimization interpretation for a representation to be called \textbf{physical}. More specifically, a physical representation could consist of a set of competing \textbf{optimization principles} such that a transition happens provided they are all optimized by it. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that this distinction can result in an \textbf{infinite information gap}, with some partial orders having mathematical representations that involve a finite amount of information and requiring infinite information to build a physical representation. We connect this phenomenon with well-known resource-theoretic scenarios like majorization, and develop notions of partial order dimension that run in parallel to the representations that we consider. Our results improve on the classification of preordered spaces in terms of real-valued functions.</description>

      <title>A primal-dual price-optimization method for computing equilibrium prices in mean-field games models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple yet efficient Lagrangian method for computing equilibrium prices in a mean-field game price-formation model. We prove that equilibrium prices are optimal in terms of a suitable criterion and derive a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm for computing them. One of the highlights of our computational framework is the efficient, simple, and flexible implementation of the algorithm using modern automatic differentiation techniques. Our implementation is modular and admits a seamless extension to high-dimensional settings with more complex dynamics, costs, and equilibrium conditions. Additionally, automatic differentiation enables a versatile algorithm that requires only coding the cost functions of agents. It automatically handles the gradients of the costs, thereby eliminating the need to manually form the adjoint equations.</description>
