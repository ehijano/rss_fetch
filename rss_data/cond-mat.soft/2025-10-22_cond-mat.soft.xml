      <title>Geometric Field Theory for Elastohydrodynamics of Cosserat Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slender structures are ubiquitous in biological and physical systems, from bacterial flagella to soft robotic arms. The Cosserat rod provides a mathematical framework for slender bodies that can stretch, shear, twist and bend. In viscous fluid environments at low Reynolds numbers - as encountered in soft matter physics, biophysics, and soft continuum robotics - inertial effects become negligible, and hydrodynamic forces are well approximated by Stokes friction. We demonstrate that the resulting elastohydrodynamic equations of motion, when formulated using Cartan's method of moving frames, possess the structure of a geometric field theory in which the configuration field takes values in SE(3), the Lie group of rigid body motions. This geometric formulation yields coordinate-independent equations that are manifestly invariant under spatial isometries and naturally suited to constitutive modeling based on Curie's principle. We derive integrability conditions that determine when constitutive laws can be derived from an energy functional, thereby distinguishing between passive and active material responses. We also obtain the beam limit for small deformations. Our results establish a unified geometric framework for the nonlinear mechanics of slender structures in slow viscous flow and enable efficient numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Elastohydrodynamic instabilities of a soft robotic arm in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and control of soft robots operating in fluid environments requires a careful understanding of the interplay between large elastic body deformations and hydrodynamic forces. Here we show that this interplay leads to novel elastohydrodynamic instabilities in a clamped soft robotic arm driven terminally by a constant pressure in a viscous fluid. We model the arm as a Cosserat rod that can stretch, shear and bend. We obtain invariant, geometrically exact, non-linear equations of motion by using Cartan's method of moving frames. Stability to small perturbations of a straight rod is governed by a non-Hermitian linear operator. Eigenanalysis shows that stability is lost through a Hopf bifurcation with the increase of pressure above a first threshold. A surprising return to stability is obtained with further increase of pressure beyond a second threshold. Numerical solutions of the non-linear equations, using a geometrically exact spectral method, confirms stable limit-cycle oscillations between these two pressure thresholds. An asymptotic analysis in the beam limit rationalizes these results analytically. This counterintuitive sequence of bifurcations underscores the subtle nature of the elastohydrodynamic coupling in Cosserat rods and emphasizes their importance for the control of the viscous dynamics of soft robots.</description>

      <title>Granular fluid in an arbitrary external potential: spontaneous convection, self-phoresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic stationary states of a granular fluid are addressed theoretically when subject to energy injection and a time-independent, but otherwise arbitrary external potential force. When the latter is not too symmetrical in a well defined sense, we show that a quiescent stationary state does not exist, rather than simply being unstable and, correspondingly, a steady convective state emerges spontaneously. We also unveil an unexpected connection of this feature with the self-diffusiophoresis of catalytically active particles: if an intruder in the granular fluid is the source of the potential, it will self-propel according to a recently proposed mechanism that lies beyond linear response theory, and that highlights the role of the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of the state of the granular bath. In both scenarios, a state-dependent characteristic length of the granular fluid is identified which sets the scale at which the induced flow is the largest.</description>

      <title>Flat quasicrystalline tilings in terms of density wave approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Landau theory considers structural phase transitions and crystallization as a condensation of several critical density waves whose wave vectors are symmetrically equivalent. Analyzing the simplest nonequilibrium Landau potentials obtained for decagonal and dodecagonal cases, we derive constraints on the phases of the critical waves and deduce two pairs of flat tilings that are the simplest from the viewpoint of our theory. Each pair corresponds to the same irreducible interference pattern: the vertices of the first and second tilings are located at its minima and maxima, respectively. The first decagonal pair consists of the Penrose P1 tiling and the Tie and Navette one. The second pair is represented by dodecagonal tiling of squares, triangles, and shields, and previously unidentified one formed by regular dodecagons and identical deformed pentagons. Surprisingly, the proposed method for finding extrema of interference patterns provides a straightforward way to generate the Penrose tiling P3 and its more complicated analogues with 2n-fold symmetries. Within Landau theory, we discuss the assembly of the square-triangular tiling and its relationship with the dodecagonal tiling that includes shields. Then we develop a nonequilibrium assembly approach that is based on Landau theory and allows us to produce tilings with random phason strain characteristic of quasicrystals. Interestingly, the approach can generate tilings without or with a minimum number of defective tiles. Examples of real systems rationalized within Landau theory are considered as well. Finally, the derivation of other tilings arising from the reducible interference patterns is discussed, and the relative complexity of non-phenomenological interactions required for the assembly of decagonal and dodecagonal structures is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Multiscale transitional flow in anisotropic nanoparticle suspensions revealed by time-resolved x-ray scatter microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex fluids transition from laminar to transitory flow above a critical control parameter, akin to their Newtonian counterparts. In a continuum mechanics sense, fluid elements follow the ensuing complex trajectories, giving rise to secondary flows in terms of macroscopic vortices and patterns thereof. However, if we replace idealized fluid elements with actual anisotropic nanoparticles, would their trajectories still reveal the same spatiotemporal behavior as the macroscopic flow field? This question is fundamental for complex fluids, where fully developed turbulence is suppressed by high viscosities and where understanding particle-flow coupling is central to transport, processing, and structure formation. To address this question, we develop small-angle x-ray scatter microscopy of unprecedented temporal resolution combined with polarized light imaging, thereby bridging seven orders of magnitude in lengtscales. Proof-of-principle is demonstrated on a classical stability problem, Taylor-Couette flow, of platelet-like graphene oxide nanoparticle and rod-like cellulose nanocrystal suspensions. The analysis shows hitherto hidden, markedly different multiscale dynamics underlying flow stability; while the platelet-like particles follow the wavy motion of the macroscopic, secondary flow field, the rod-like particles exhibit high-frequency motion that is uncorrelated with the vortex instabilities.</description>

      <title>Mechanical activity enables patterning and discrimination at the immune synapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immune cells recognize and discriminate antigens through immunological synapses - dynamic intercellular junctions exhibiting highly organized receptor-ligand patterns. While much work has focused on molecular kinetics and passive mechanisms of pattern formation, the role of active mechanical control in patterning and discrimination remains underexplored. We develop a minimal continuum model coupling receptor binding kinetics, membrane deformation, and cytoskeletal forces, with elastohydrodynamic flow in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations and scaling analysis reveal that contractile cortical flows arrest coarsening and stabilize long-lived multifocal clusters, whereas active pulling accelerates cluster dissolution and elevates background receptor binding. Nonequilibrium mechanical forces enable adaptive control over the speed, sensitivity, and dynamic range of affinity discrimination in a pattern-dependent manner. Our results highlight how immune cells exploit cytoskeletal remodeling to robustly regulate antigen recognition through synaptic patterning.</description>

      <title>An Encoder-Decoder Foundation Chemical Language Model for Generative Polymer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning has advanced polymer discovery, yet direct generation of chemically valid and synthesizable polymers without exhaustive enumeration remains a challenge. Here we present polyT5, an encoder-decoder chemical language model based on the T5 architecture, trained to understand and generate polymer structures. polyT5 enables both property prediction and the targeted generation of polymers conditioned on desired property values. We demonstrate its utility for dielectric polymer design, seeking candidates with dielectric constant &gt;3, bandgap &gt;4 eV, and glass transition temperature &gt;400 K, alongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000 generated promising candidates, one was experimentally synthesized and validated, showing strong agreement with predictions. To further enhance usability, we integrated polyT5 within an agentic AI framework that couples it with a general-purpose LLM, allowing natural language interaction for property prediction and generative design. Together, these advances establish a versatile and accessible framework for accelerated polymer discovery.</description>

      <title>Mean first passage time of active Brownian particles in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean first passage time (MFPT) is a key metric for understanding transport, search, and escape processes in stochastic systems. While well characterized for passive Brownian particles, its behavior in active systems-such as active Brownian particles (ABPs)-remains less understood due to their self-propelled, nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we formulate and analyze an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) to characterize the MFPT of ABPs in two-dimensional domains, including circular, annular, and elliptical regions. For annular regions, we analyze the MFPT of ABPs under various boundary conditions. Our results reveal rich behaviors in the MFPT of ABPs that differ fundamentally from those of passive particles. Notably, the MFPT exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the initial position and orientation of the particle, with maxima often occurring away from the domain center. We also find that increasing swimming speed can either increase or decrease the MFPT depending on the geometry and initial orientation. Asymptotic analysis of the PDE in the weak-activity regime provides insight into how activity modifies escape statistics of the particles in different geometries. Finally, our numerical solutions of the PDE are validated against Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.</description>

      <title>A Proliferating Nematic That Collectively Senses an Anisotropic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on growing fibroblasts, we examine the development of nematic order in a colony of elongated cells proliferating on a nematic elastomer substrate. After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.</description>

      <title>Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.</description>
