      <title>Multivariate data analysis using recurrence measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent dynamics of complex systems often arise from the internal dynamical interactions among different elements and hence is to be modeled using multiple variables that represent the different dynamical processes. When such systems are to be studied using observational or measured data, we may benefit from using data from all variables or observations of the system rather than using that from a single variable. In this study, we try to bring out the relative effectiveness of the analysis of data from multiple variables in revealing the underlying dynamical features. For this, we derive the recurrence measures from the multivariate data of standard systems in periodic, chaotic and hyper chaotic states and compare them with that from noisy data. We identify Entropy computed from Recurrence Plot and Characteristic Path Length from recurrence network as the most effective measures that can identify the nature of the dynamical state of the system, and differentiate it from stochastic or noisy behaviour. We find that for different variables, the recurrence measures to be mostly similar for data from periodic states, while they differ for chaotic and hyperchaotic states, indicating that multi-variate analysis is useful for real world systems in the latter states.</description>

      <title>Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude/phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents in fundamental models of nonlinear resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of analytical estimation of the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov timescales of the motion in multiplets of interacting nonlinear resonances is considered. To this end, we elaborate a unified framework, based on the separatrix map theory, which incorporates both an earlier approach for the first fundamental model of perturbed resonance (given by the perturbed pendulum Hamiltonian) and a new one for its second fundamental model (given by the perturbed Andoyer Hamiltonian). Within this framework, new accurate estimates for the Lyapunov timescales of the inner and outer subsystems of the Solar planetary system are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling and dynamics in a two-dimensional lattice of identical oscillators with frustrated couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional lattice of oscillators with identical (zero) intrinsic frequencies and Kuramoto type of interactions with randomly frustrated couplings is considered. Starting the time evolution from slightly perturbed synchronized states, we study numerically the relaxation properties, as well as properties at the stable fixed point which can also be viewed as a metastable state of the closely related XY spin glass model. According to our results, the order parameter at the stable fixed point shows generally a slow, reciprocal logarithmic convergence to its limiting value with the system size. The infinite-size limit is found to be close to zero for zero-centered Gaussian couplings, whereas, for a binary $\pm 1$ distribution with a sufficiently high concentration of positive couplings, it is significantly above zero. Besides, the relaxation time is found to grow algebraically with the system size. Thus, the order parameter in an infinite system approaches its limiting value inversely proportionally to $\ln t$ at late times $t$, similarly to that found in the model with all-to-all couplings [Daido, Chaos {\bf 28}, 045102 (2018)]. As opposed to the order parameter, the energy of the corresponding XY model is found to converge algebraically to its infinite-size limit.</description>

      <title>Temporal Convolution Derived Multi-Layered Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of time series is a challenging task relevant in such diverse applications as analyzing financial data, forecasting flow dynamics or understanding biological processes. Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep Recurrent Neural Networks. Alternative, when using a Reservoir Computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we focus on the Reservoir Computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior as well as the SantaFe Laser dataset and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to Echo State Networks, Autoencoder connected Echo State Networks and Gated Recurrent Units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ compared to Echo State Networks and $90.72\%$ compared to Gated Recurrent Units. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to the existing approaches.</description>
