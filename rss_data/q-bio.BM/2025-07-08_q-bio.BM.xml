      <title>DISPROTBENCH: A Disorder-Aware, Task-Rich Benchmark for Evaluating Protein Structure Prediction in Realistic Biological Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction have achieved near-atomic accuracy for well-folded proteins. However, current benchmarks inadequately assess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those involving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in applications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and protein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural disorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes: (1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking twelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification, regression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the DisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error analyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under disorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures. Notably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in disordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation. DisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded framework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Olfaction: New Insights into Human Odorant Binding Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until today, the exact function of mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) remains a topic of debate. Although their main established function lacks direct evidence in human olfaction, OBPs are traditionally believed to act as odorant transporters in the olfactory sense, which led to the exploration of OBPs as biomimetic sensor units in artificial noses. Now, available RNA-seq and proteomics data identified the expression of human OBPs (hOBP2A and hOBP2B) in both, male and female reproductive tissues. This observation prompted the conjecture that OBPs may possess functions that go beyond the olfactory sense, potentially as hormone transporters. Such a function could further link them to the tumorigenesis and cancer progression of hormone dependent cancer types including ovarian, breast, prostate and uterine cancer. In this structured review, we use available data to explore the effects of genetic alterations such as somatic copy number aberrations and single nucleotide variants on OBP function and their corresponding gene expression profiles. Our computational analyses suggest that somatic copy number aberrations in OBPs are associated with large changes in gene expression in reproductive cancers while point mutations have little to no effect. Additionally, the structural characteristics of OBPs, together with other lipocalin family members, allow us to explore putative functions within the context of cancer biology. Our overview consolidates current knowledge on putative human OBP functions, their expression patterns, and structural features. Finally, it provides an overview on applications, highlighting emerging hypotheses and future research directions within olfactory and non-olfactory roles.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Single-particle Profiling of Extracellular Vesicles via Fluorescent Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have drawn rapidly increasing attention as the next-generation diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. However, the heterogeneous nature of EVs necessitates advanced methods for profiling EVs at the single-particle level. While nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) is a widely used technique for quantifying particle size and concentration, conventional scattering-based systems are non-specific. In this study, we present an optimised protocol for quantitative profiling of EVs at the single-particle level by fluorescent NTA (F-NTA). The protocol integrates fluorescent immunolabeling of EVs with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to efficiently remove unbound labels, enabling the precise quantification of EV concentration, size distribution, and surface immunophenotype. We first validated this approach using biotinylated liposomes and EVs from cultured human cell lines, confirming effective removal of unbound labels and assessing labelling efficiency. We then demonstrated that F-NTA can distinguish EV subpopulations with distinct surface marker expression, exemplified by the differentiation of EpCAM-positive EVs derived from HT29 and HEK293 cells. Finally, we applied dual labelling to human plasma isolates to simultaneously profile EVs and non-vesicular extracellular particles, providing a quantitative quality assessment of EV purity at the single-particle level. The robustness of this method was further supported by comparative analysis with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This validated workflow enables robust, quantitative profiling of EV subpopulations, providing a critical tool for diverse EV applications, including biomarker discovery, therapeutic monitoring, and quality control for engineered vesicles.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent for Modular Task Execution in Drug Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED &gt; 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction in Transformers for Interpreting TCR-pMHC Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CD8+ "killer" T cells and CD4+ "helper" T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs). Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods; we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.</description>

      <title>Molecular Machine Learning Using Euler Characteristic Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor. Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features, offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance}, outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and code used in this work.</description>

      <title>PRING: Rethinking Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction from Pairs to Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce IntFold, a controllable foundation model for general and specialized biomolecular structure prediction. Utilizing a high-performance custom attention kernel, IntFold achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art AlphaFold 3 on a comprehensive benchmark of diverse biomolecular structures, while also significantly outperforming other leading all-atom prediction approaches. The model's key innovation is its controllability, enabling downstream applications critical for drug screening and design. Through specialized adapters, it can be precisely guided to predict complex allosteric states, apply user-defined structural constraints, and estimate binding affinity. Furthermore, we present a training-free, similarity-based method for ranking predictions that improves success rates in a model-agnostic manner. This report details these advancements and shares insights from the training and development of this large-scale model.</description>
