      <title>Expressive Symbolic Regression for Interpretable Models of Discrete-Time Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretable mathematical expressions defining discrete-time dynamical systems (iterated maps) can model many phenomena of scientific interest, enabling a deeper understanding of system behaviors. Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor. These performances offer significant promise for data-driven scientific discovery and interpretation.</description>

      <title>clauseSMT: A NLSAT-Based Clause-Level Framework for Satisfiability Modulo Nonlinear Real Arithmetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework has been applied to SMT problems on different arithmetic theories. NLSAT, an implementation using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for explanation, is especially competitive among nonlinear real arithmetic constraints. However, current Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)-style algorithms only consider literal information for decision, and thus ignore clause-level influence on arithmetic variables. As a consequence, NLSAT encounters unnecessary conflicts caused by improper literal decisions.
  In this work, we analyze the literal decision caused conflicts, and introduce clause-level information with a direct effect on arithmetic variables. Two main algorithm improvements are presented: clause-level feasible-set based look-ahead mechanism and arithmetic propagation based branching heuristic. We implement our solver named clauseSMT on our dynamic variable ordering framework. Experiments show that clauseSMT is competitive on nonlinear real arithmetic theory against existing SMT solvers (cvc5, Z3, Yices2), and outperforms all these solvers on satisfiable instances of SMT(QF_NRA) in SMT-LIB. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are also studied.</description>
