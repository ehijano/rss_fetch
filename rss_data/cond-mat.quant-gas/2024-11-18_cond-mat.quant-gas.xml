      <title>Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hall effect has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms, where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Distribution Function for $n \ge g$ Quantum Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new quantum mechanical distribution function $n^I(\varepsilon)$, is derived for the condition $n \ge g$, where in contrast to the exclusion principle $n \le g$ for fermions, each energy state must be populated by at least one particle. Although the particles share many features with bosons, the anomalous behavior of $n^I(\varepsilon)$ precludes Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) due to the required occupancy of the excited states, which creates a permanently pressurized background at $T=0$, similar to the degeneracy pressure of fermions. An exhaustive classification scheme is presented for both distinguishable and indistinguishable, particles and energy levels based on Richard Stanley's twelvefold way in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy dynamics of non-Gaussian states in free boson systems: random sampling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from an insulating state in free boson systems. Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial state, calculating the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy calls for the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent. We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an $N_{\mathrm{s}}\times N_{\mathrm{s}}$ matrix corresponding to $N_{\mathrm{s}}$ sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes $\mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ with a constant $\alpha\ll 1$, in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the $\mathcal{O}(2^{N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ number of summations requiring the exponential-time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than $100$ sites. We present several examples of the entanglement entropy dynamics in low-dimensional free boson systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant stroboscopic Rydberg dressing: electron-motion coupling and multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg dressing traditionally refers to a technique where interactions between cold atoms are imprinted through the far off-resonant continuous-wave excitation of high-lying Rydberg states. Dipolar interactions between these electronic states are then translated into effective interactions among ground state atoms. Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate two dressing protocols, in which Rydberg atoms are resonantly excited in a stroboscopic fashion. The first one is non-adiabatic, meaning Rydberg states are excited by fast pulses. In this case, mechanical forces among Rydberg atoms result in electron-motion coupling, which generates effective multi-body interactions. In the second, adiabatic protocol, Rydberg states are excited by smoothly varying laser pulses. We show that also in this protocol substantial multi-body interactions emerge.</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $6 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>

      <title>Insulator phases of Bose-Fermi mixtures induced by intraspecies next-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional mixture of two-color fermions and scalar bosons at the hardcore limit, focusing on the effect that the intraspecies next-neighbor interactions have on the zero-temperature ground state of the system for different fillings of each carrier. Exploring the problem's parameters, we observed that the non-local interaction could favor or harm the well-known mixed Mott and spin-selective Mott insulators. We also found the emergence of three unusual insulating states with charge density wave (CDW) structures in which the orders of the carriers are out of phase with each other. For instance, the immiscible CDW appears only at half-filling bosonic density, whereas the mixed CDW state is characterized by equal densities of bosons and fermions. Finally, the spin-selective CDW couples the bosons and only one kind of fermions. Appropriate order parameters were proposed for each phase to obtain the critical parameters for the corresponding superfluid-insulator transition. Our results can inspire or contribute to understanding experiments in cold-atom setups with long-range interactions or recent reports involving quasiparticles in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Fast manipulation of a quantum gas on an atom chip with a strong microwave field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental platform based on an atom chip encompassing a coplanar waveguide which enables to manipulate a quantum gas of sodium atoms with strong microwave fields. We describe the production with this setup of a very elongated degenerate quantum gas with typically 10^6 atoms, that can be prepared all along the cross-over from the three-dimensional to the one-dimensional regime depending on the atom number and trapping geometry. Using the microwave field radiated by the waveguide, we drive Rabi oscillations between the hyperfine ground states, with the atoms trapped at various distances from the waveguide. At the closest position explored, the field amplitude exceeds 5 G, corresponding to a Rabi frequency larger than 6 MHz. This enables fast manipulation of the atomic internal state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent three-photon excitation of the strontium clock transition with a contrast of 51(12)% using a Bose-Einstein condensate. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer, overcoming the typical limitations of this technique to odd-level numbers. We also measure the two-body loss coefficient of $^{84}$Sr clock-state atoms. Our work constitutes an essential step towards outcoupling a continuous atom laser beam and provides a fast excitation mechanism for quantum simulation using bosonic alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paraxial propagation of a quasi-monochromatic light wave with two circular polarizations in a defocusing Kerr medium with anomalous dispersion inside a waveguide of annular cross-section was considered. In the phase-separated mode, the dynamics is similar to a flow of immiscible fluids. For some initial conditions with relative gliding of the fluids along the interface, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in its ``quantum'' variant is developed. Numerical simulations of the corresponding coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations have shown formation of specific structures at the nonlinear stage of the instability. Similar structures have been known in the theory of binary Bose-Einstein condensates, but for optics they were presented for the first time.</description>

      <title>Quantum wires with local particle loss: Transport manifestations of fluctuation-induced effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of a quantum wire of weakly interacting fermions in the presence of local particle loss. We calculate current and conductance in this system due to applied external chemical potential bias that can be measured in experimental realizations of ultracold fermions in quasi one-dimensional traps. Using a Keldysh field theory approach based on the Lindblad equation, we establish a perturbative scheme to study the effect of imbalanced reservoirs. Logarithmically divergent terms are resummed using a renormalization group method, and a novel powerlaw behavior for the conductance as a function of the potential bias across the wire is found. In contrast to the equilibrium case of a potential barrier in a Luttinger liquid, the conductance exhibits a scaling behavior, which depends on the interaction strength and on the loss probability. Repulsive interactions reduce the conductance of the wire while attractive interactions enhance it. However, perfect reflectivity and transparency are only reached in the absence of particle loss.</description>

      <title>Floquet Flux Attachment in Cold Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux attachment provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding certain forms of topological order, including most notably the fractional quantum Hall effect. Despite its ubiquitous use as a theoretical tool, directly realizing flux attachment in a microscopic setting remains an open challenge. Here, we propose a simple approach to realizing flux attachment in a periodically-driven (Floquet) system of either spins or hard-core bosons. We demonstrate that such a system naturally realizes correlated hopping interactions and provides a sharp connection between such interactions and flux attachment. Starting with a simple, nearest-neighbor, free boson model, we find evidence -- from both a coupled wire analysis and large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations -- that Floquet flux attachment stabilizes the bosonic integer quantum Hall state at $1/4$ filling (on a square lattice), and the Halperin-221 fractional quantum Hall state at $1/6$ filling (on a honeycomb lattice). At $1/2$ filling on the square lattice, time-reversal symmetry is instead spontaneously broken and bosonic integer quantum Hall states with opposite Hall conductances are degenerate. Finally, we propose an optical-lattice-based implementation of our model on a square lattice and discuss prospects for adiabatic preparation as well as effects of Floquet heating.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Boundary Effects through Quantum Trajectories in Dissipative SSH Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>
