      <title>Nested superposition principle for random measures and the geometry of the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of the space of random measures $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(X))$, endowed with the Wasserstein on Wasserstein metric, where $(X, d)$ is a complete separable metric space. In this setting, we prove a metric superposition principle, in the spirit of the result by S. Lisini, that will allow us to recover important geometric features of the space. When $X$ is $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the differential structure of $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d))$ in analogy with the simpler Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We show that continuity equations for random measures involving the abstract concept of derivation acting on cylinder functions can be more conveniently described by suitable non-local vector fields $b:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}^d$. In this way, we can: 1) characterize the absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space; 2) define and characterize its tangent bundle; 3) prove a superposition principle for the solutions to the standard non-local continuity equation in terms of solutions of interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Spans and convex combinations of boundary-valued continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $(n\ge 2)$-dimensional real Banach space $E$ with unit ball $E_{\le 1}$ and a topological space $X$ arbitrary elements in $C(X,E_{\le 1})$ are always expressible as linear combinations of at most three functions valued in the unit sphere $\partial E_{\le 1}$. On the other hand, for normal $X$, $C(X,E_{\le 1})$ can only be the convex hull of $C(X,\partial E_{\le 1})$ if the covering dimension of $X$ is strictly smaller than $\dim E$. A variant of this remark is the characterization of normal $X$ with $\dim X&lt;\dim E$ as precisely those for which $C(X,E_{\le 1})$ is the convex hull of nowhere-vanishing continuous $X\to E_{\le 1}$ or, equivalently, that of continuous functions $X\to E_{[r,1]}$, $r\in (0,1)$ valued in arbitrarily thin spherical shells.
  This extends a number of results due to Peck, Cantwell, Bogachev, Mena-Jurado, Navarro-Pascual and Jim\'enez-Vargas and others revolving around the realizability of the unit ball of $C(X,E)$ as a convex hull of its extreme points for strictly convex and/or complex $E$.</description>

      <title>Maximum principles for matrix-valued regular functions of a quaternionic variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quaternionic matrix-valued regular function is a map $F: \Omega \rightarrow M_n(\mathbb{H})$ whose entries are regular functions of a quaternion variable, where $\Omega$ is a domain in $\mathbb{H}$. Our aim is to bring out some maximum norm principles for such functions. We derive a decomposition theorem for such functions and also prove a Caratheodory-Rudin type approximation theorem for functions in the quaternionic right Schur class. This in turn yields that a $2 \times 2$ norm one matrix-valued function can be approximated by quaternionic rational inner functions.</description>

      <title>Separability and Submetrizability in Locally Convex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the property of countable separation for a locally convex Hausdorff space $X$ and relate it to the existence of a metrizable coarser topology. Building on this, we demonstrate how the separability of $X$ is equivalent to the existence of a locally convex topology on the dual $X'$ that is metrizable and coarser than the weak topology $\sigma(X', X)$. This result generalizes known conditions for separability and provides a precise duality between separability and metrizability. We also show how to derive new and known conditions for the separability of $X$ from this characterization.</description>

      <title>The Two-Sided Clifford Dunkl Transform and Miyachi's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have extended the Dunkl transform to the setting of Clifford algebras. In particular, the two-sided quaternionic Dunkl transform has been introduced as a Dunkl analogue of the two-dimensional quaternionic Fourier transform. In this paper, we develop the two-sided Clifford Dunkl transform, defined using two square roots of -1 in Cl_{p,q}. We establish its fundamental properties, including the inversion and Plancherel formulas, and provide two explicit expressions for the associated translation operator. Moreover, we prove an analogue of Miyachi's theorem for this transform, thereby extending a classical result in harmonic analysis to the Clifford-Dunkl framework.</description>

      <title>Determination of Range Conditions for General Projection Pair Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomographic techniques are vital in modern medicine, allowing doctors to observe patients' interior features. Individual steps in the measurement process are modeled by `single projection operators' $p$. These are line integral operators over a collection of curves that covers the regions of interest. Then, the entire measurement process can be understood as a finite collection of such single projections, and thus be modeled by an $N$-projections operator $P=(p_1,\dots,p_N)$. The most well-known example of an $N$-projections operator is the restriction of the Radon transform to finitely many projection angles. Characterizations of the range of $N$-projections operators are of intrinsic mathematical interest and can also help in practical applications such as geometric calibration, motion detection, or model parameter identification. In this work, we investigate the range of projection pair operators $\mathcal{P}$ in the plane, i.e., operators formed by two projections ($N=2$) applied to functions in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We find that the set of annihilators to $\mathrm{rg}(\mathcal{P})$ that are regular distributions contains at most one dimension and a range condition can be explicitly determined by what we refer to as `kernel conditions'. With this tool, we examine the exponential fanbeam transform for which no range conditions were known, finding that no (regular) range condition exists, and therefore, arbitrary data can be approximated in an $L^2$ sense by projections of smooth functions. We also illustrate the use of this theory on a mixed parallel-fanbeam projection pair operator.</description>

      <title>First order equation on random measures as superposition of weak solutions to the McKean-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define an evolution equation for a curve of random probability measures $(M_t)_{t\in[0,T]}\subset \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ associated to a non-local drift $b:[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a non-local diffusion term $a:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \operatorname{Sym}_+(\mathbb{R}^{d\times d})$. Then, we show that any solution to that equation can be lifted to a superposition of solutions to a non-linear Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation and also to a superposition of weak solutions to the McKean-Vlasov equations. Finally, we use this superposition result to show how existence and uniqueness can be transferred from the equation on random measures to the associated non-linear Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation and to the McKean-Vlasov equation, assuming uniqueness of the linearized KFP.</description>

      <title>Variational formulae for entropy-like functionals for states in von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents variational formulae for entropy-like functionals, including Segal and R\'enyi entropies, for normal states on semifinite von Neumann algebras. The considered functionals are of the form $\tau(f(h))$ where $\tau$ is a normal faithful semifinite trace on this algebra, $h$ is a positive selfadjoint operator from $L^1(\M,\tau)$, and $f$ is an appropriate convex or concave function. The results cover both finite and semifinite algebras, and the obtained formulae generalise known results, in particular, those concerning relative entropy. Moreover, the connection between quantum entropies and the structure of abelian subalgebras is highlighted, providing new interpretations in the context of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Frictional martingale optimal transport and robust hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study martingale optimal transport (MOT) with state-dependent trading frictions and develop a geometric-duality framework that extends from one time-step to the multi-marginal setting. Building on the frictionless left-monotone structure (Beiglb\"ock and Juillet, Ann. Probab. 2016; Henry-Labord\`ere and Touzi, Finance Stoch. 2016; Beiglb\"ock et al, Ann. Probab. 2017), we penalize trade increments by a convex cost and prove a frictional monotonicity principle. Optimal couplings admit bi-atomic disintegrations on active components, while a trade band emerges as a no-transaction region where the identity coupling is optimal. The band is characterized in dual variables by a subgradient condition at the origin; off the band, transport moves along two monotone graphs whose endpoints solve an equal-slope system balancing continuation values and marginal trading costs.
  We establish strong duality with attainment for state-dependent frictions, a dynamic programming identity that aggregates the one time-step problem, and stability of optimal couplings and endpoints under perturbations of marginals and friction. In the vanishing-friction limit the transport maps converge to the frictionless left-curtain coupling. For linear-quadratic frictions, motivated by spread and transient impact (Almgren and Chriss, J. Risk 2001; Obizhaeva and Wang, J. Financ. Mark. 2013), we obtain explicit off-band displacements and comparative statics in liquidity parameters. Applications include model-independent pricing/superhedging of lookback, barrier, and Asian options. Overall, the results link robust superhedging duality (Beiglb\"ock et al, Finance Stoch. 2013; Dolinsky and Soner, Finance Stoch. 2014) with the fine geometry of frictional MOT, providing a unified basis for analysis, stability, and computation in multi-marginal robust pricing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a Space-Time Connectivity Theorem for normal currents. In analogy to classical results by Federer and Fleming as well as a recent theorem for integral currents by the second author, this result allows one to witness the weak* convergence of a uniformly bounded sequence of boundaryless normal currents with a space-time normal current that connects the elements of the sequence with their limit. The space-time setting is distinguished from the classical case in that this connecting current has a time coordinate and thus constitutes a progressive-in-time way to deform an element of the sequence to the limit.</description>

Abstract: Let $C$ be a conjugation on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. A densely defined linear operator $A$ on $\mathcal{H}$ is called $C$-symmetric if $CAC\subseteq A^*$ and $C$-self-adjoint if $CAC=A^*$. Our main results describe all $C$-self-adjoint extensions of $A$ on $\mathcal{H}$. Further, we prove a $C$-self-adjointness criterion based on quasi-analytic vectors and we characterize $C$-self-adjoint operators in terms of their polar decompositions.</description>

      <title>Twisted crossed products of Banach algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a locally compact group $G$, a nondegenerate Banach algebra $A$ with a contractive approximate identity, a twisted action $(\alpha, \sigma)$ of $G$ on $A$, and a family $\mathcal{R}$ of uniformly bounded representations of $A$ on Banach spaces, we define the twisted crossed product $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$. When $\mathcal{R}$ consists of contractive representations, we show that $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$ is a Banach algebra with a contractive approximate identity, which can also be characterized by an isometric universal property.
  As an application, we specialize to the $L^p$-operator algebra setting, defining both the $L^p$-twisted crossed product and the reduced version. Finally, we give a generalization of the so-called Packer-Raeburn trick to the $L^p$-setting, showing that any $L^p$-twisted crossed product is "stably" isometrically isomorphic to an untwisted one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frames allow all elements of a Hilbert space to be reconstructed by inner product data in a stable manner. Recently, there is interest in relaxing the definition of frames to understand the implications for stable signal recovery. In this paper, we relax the definition of a frame by allowing the operator in the frame decomposition formula to not be invertible. We provide a complete classification of sequences that allow this decomposition via a type of frame operator. Additionally, we provide several examples of sequences that allow this reconstruction property that are not frames and illustrate in which ways they fail to be frames. Furthermore, we provide a Paley-Wiener type stability result for sequences that do this frame-like reconstruction, which is also stable under the non-frame property. Finally, we classify certain Schauder bases-such as unconditional and exponential bases-that satisfy this relaxed frame reconstruction condition.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of operator systems: tight extensions and noncommutative measurable structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra generated by some separable operator system $S$. More than a decade ago, Arveson conjectured that $S$ is hyperrigid in $A$ if all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$. Recently, a counterexample to the conjecture was found by Bilich and Dor-On. To circumvent the difficulties hidden in this counterexample, we exploit some of Pedersen's seminal ideas on noncommutative measurable structures and establish an amended version of Arveson's conjecture. More precisely, we show that all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$ precisely when all representations of $A$ admit a unique "tight" completely positive extension from $S$. In addition, we prove an equivalence between uniqueness of such tight extensions and rigidity of completely positive approximations for representations of nuclear $C^*$-algebras, thereby extending the classical principle of Korovkin--Saskin for commutative algebras of continuous functions.</description>
