      <title>Non-solitary wave response generated by "soft" striker impact on strongly nonlinear weakly dissipative granular chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that striker impact on strongly nonlinear, non-dissipative or weakly dissipative granular chains assembled from spheres (or cylinders with flat ends and spheres) having similar masses results in strongly nonlinear Nesterenko solitary waves on a very short distance from the impacted end. This paper presents the first experimental results on the nature of the wave response excited by striker impact on strongly nonlinear weakly dissipative discrete chains assembled from cylinders with flat ends and spheres having similar masses depending on the ramp time of the incoming pulse. Variation of the pulse ramp time was accomplished using "hard" and "soft" striker impact. In the case of "hard" impact, the incoming pulse with relatively short ramp time was split into Nesterenko solitary waves after traveling about 20 particles as in previous publications. The "soft" impact by the same striker with the same velocity was achieved by placing a small mass PTFE spherical particle inside a PTFE O-ring at the top of the first cylinder resulting in significantly longer ramp time of incoming pulse. The incoming pulse generated by "soft" impact did not split into a train of solitary waves despite the initial steepening of the leading front due to strong nonlinearity. Instead, it traveled as a shock-like stress wave a long distance of 131 particles. Thus, the generation of a train of solitary waves or shock-like stress wave in a weakly dissipative, strongly nonlinear discrete chain depends on the duration of the incoming pulse ramp. Ramping incoming pulse resulted in dramatic decrease of shock-like stress wave amplitude in comparison with amplitude of the leading solitary wave in case of "hard" impact.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark breathers on an elliptic wave in the defocusing mKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.</description>
