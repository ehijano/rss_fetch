      <title>Closed-loop geothermal systems: Modeling and predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geothermal energy is a sustainable baseload source recognized for its ability to provide clean energy on a large scale. Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS) -- offer promising prototypes -- employ a closed-loop vascular layout that runs deep beneath the Earth's surface. A working fluid (e.g., water or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2)) circulates through the vasculature, entering the subsurface at the inlet and exiting at the outlet with an elevated temperature. For designing and performing cost-benefit analysis before deploying large-scale projects and maintaining efficiency while enabling real-time monitoring during the operational phase, modeling offers cost-effective solutions; often, it is the only available option for performance assessment. A knowledge gap exists due to the lack of a fast predictive modeling framework that considers the vascular intricacies, particularly the jumps in the solution fields across the channel. Noting that the channel diameter is considerably smaller in scale compared to the surrounding geological domain, we develop a reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for closed-loop geothermal systems. This ROM incorporates the jump conditions and provides a quick and accurate prediction of the temperature field, including the outlet temperature, which directly correlates with the power production capacity and thermal draw-down. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the framework by establishing the uniqueness of the solutions and reporting representative numerical solutions. The modeling framework and the predictions reported in this paper benefit the closed-loop geothermal community, enabling them to determine the system's performance and optimal capacity.</description>

      <title>TopoLedgerBERT: Topological Learning of Ledger Description Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a long-standing problem in the field of accounting: mapping company-specific ledger accounts to a standardized chart of accounts. We propose a novel solution, TopoLedgerBERT, a unique sentence embedding method devised specifically for ledger account mapping. This model integrates hierarchical information from the charts of accounts into the sentence embedding process, aiming to accurately capture both the semantic similarity and the hierarchical structure of the ledger accounts. In addition, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that enriches the training data and, as a result, increases the performance of our proposed model. Compared to benchmark methods, TopoLedgerBERT demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and mean reciprocal rank.</description>

      <title>Abdominal aortic aneurysm wall stress: A 7-line code in MATLAB and a one-click software application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the irreversible dilation of the lower aorta, usually detected incidentally during imaging for other health issues. Current clinical practice for managing AAA relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, based on the aneurysm's maximum diameter and growth rate, which can lead to underestimation or overestimation of AAA rupture risk. Patient-specific AAA wall stress, computed using biomechanical models derived from medical images without needing patient-specific material properties, has been widely investigated for developing individualized AAA rupture risk predictors. Therefore, AAA wall stress, determined reliably and quickly, has the potential to enhance patient-specific treatment plans. This paper presents a 7-line code, written in MATLAB using the Partial Differential Equation Toolbox, for AAA wall stress computations via finite element analysis. The code takes AAA wall geometry as input and outputs stress components over the AAA wall domain. Additionally, we present a one-click standalone software application for AAA wall stress computation, developed based on our 7-line code using MATLAB Compiler. After verification, we used our code to compute AAA wall stress in ten patients. Our analysis indicated that the 99th percentile of maximum principal stress across all patients ranged from 0.320 MPa to 0.522 MPa, with an average of 0.401 MPa and a standard deviation of 0.056 MPa. Moreover, for every case, the MATLAB simulation time was less than a minute on a laptop workstation.</description>

      <title>An efficient pipeline to compute patient-specific cerebral aneurysm wall tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral aneurysm rupture, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage with a high mortality rate, disproportionately affects younger populations, resulting in a significant loss of productive life years. A significant proportion of these deaths is due to aneurysmal re-bleeding within the first three days following the initial bleed, prior to treatment. While early aneurysm treatment is recommended, there is no consensus on the ideal timing, and emergency treatment offers only an incremental benefit at a significant cost. Although various multivariable prediction models have been proposed to provide personalized risk assessments, no validated patient-specific predictor is available to rationalize emergency treatment. Furthermore, no model has yet incorporated emerging computational biomechanics-based biomarkers such as wall tension. In this paper, we proposed and validated an efficient semi-automatic pipeline to compute patient-specific cerebral aneurysm wall tension as a potential biomarker for the likelihood of re-bleeding. Our pipeline uses the patient's computed tomography angiography (CTA) image obtained at the time of subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosis to create a patient-specific biomechanical model of the cerebral aneurysm using the finite element method. A distinctive feature of our approach is the straightforward model creation and wall tension computation using shell finite elements, without requiring patient-specific material properties or aneurysm wall thickness. Our non-invasive, patient-specific method for cerebral aneurysm wall tension can potentially provide individualized risk prediction and enhance clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Wideband Beamforming with RIS: A Unified Framework via Space-Frequency Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum shift from the sub-6G band to the high-frequency band has posed an ever-increasing demand on the paradigm shift from narrowband beamforming to wideband beamforming. Despite recent research efforts, the problem of wideband beamforming design is particularly challenging in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems, due to that RIS is not capable of performing frequency-dependent phase shift, therefore inducing high signal processing complexity. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-efficient wideband beamforming design for RIS-assisted systems, in which a transmitter sends wideband signals to a desired target, through the aid of the RIS. In our proposed design, we exploit space-frequency Fourier transformation and stationary phase method to yield an approximate closed-form solution of the RIS phase shifts which significantly reduces the signal processing complexity, compared to the existing approaches. The obtained solution is then used to generate a large and flat beampattern over the desired frequency band. Through numerical results, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed beamforming design and demonstrate how it can improve system performances in terms of communication rate and sensing resolution. Beyond generating the flat beampattern, we highlight that our proposed design is capable of mimicking any desired beampattern by matching the RIS phase shift with the amplitude modulation function, thus providing valuable insights into the design of novel wideband beamforming for RIS-assisted systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Neural Network for Uncertainty Quantification in Transonic Aerodynamic Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity models are becoming more prevalent in engineering, particularly in aerospace, as they combine both the computational efficiency of low-fidelity models with the high accuracy of higher-fidelity simulations. Various state-of-the-art techniques exist for fusing data from different fidelity sources, including Co-Kriging and transfer learning in neural networks. This paper aims to implement a multi-fidelity Bayesian neural network model that applies transfer learning to fuse data generated by models at different fidelities. Bayesian neural networks use probability distributions over network weights, enabling them to provide predictions along with estimates of their confidence. This approach harnesses the predictive and data fusion capabilities of neural networks while also quantifying uncertainty. The results demonstrate that the multi-fidelity Bayesian model outperforms the state-of-the-art Co-Kriging in terms of overall accuracy and robustness on unseen data.</description>

      <title>Auto-PICNN: Automated machine learning for physics-informed convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) have introduced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which integrate machine learning with physical laws. Physics-informed convolutional neural networks (PICNNs) extend PINNs by leveraging CNNs for enhanced generalization and efficiency. However, current PICNNs depend on manual design, and inappropriate designs may not effectively solve PDEs. Furthermore, due to the diversity of physical problems, the ideal network architectures and loss functions vary across different PDEs. It is impractical to find the optimal PICNN architecture and loss function for each specific physical problem through extensive manual experimentation. To surmount these challenges, this paper uses automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically and efficiently search for the loss functions and network architectures of PICNNs. We introduce novel search spaces for loss functions and network architectures and propose a two-stage search strategy. The first stage focuses on searching for factors and residual adjustment operations that influence the loss function, while the second stage aims to find the best CNN architecture. Experimental results show that our automatic searching method significantly outperforms the manually-designed model on multiple datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Agtrup (BlueKolding) dataset, collected from Denmark's Agtrup wastewater treatment plant, specifically designed to enhance phosphorus removal via chemical and biological methods. This rich dataset is assembled through a high-frequency Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system data collection process, which captures a wide range of variables related to the operational dynamics of nutrient removal. It comprises time-series data featuring measurements sampled to a frequency of two minutes across various control, process, and environmental variables. The comprehensive dataset aims to foster significant advancements in wastewater management by supporting the development of sophisticated predictive models and optimizing operational strategies. By providing detailed insights into the interactions and efficiencies of chemical and biological phosphorus removal processes, the dataset serves as a vital resource for environmental researchers and engineers focused on improving the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment operations. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to facilitate the creation of digital twins and the application of machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, to predict and enhance system performance under varying operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Discriminating Serotonergic Neurons using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei exhibit diverse electrophysiological properties and functional roles, yet conventional identification methods rely on restrictive criteria that likely overlook atypical serotonergic cells. The use of convolutional neural network (CNN) for comprehensive classification of both typical and atypical serotonergic neurons is an interesting one, but the key challenge is often given by the limited experimental data available for training. This study presents a procedure for synthetic data generation that combines smoothed spike waveforms with heterogeneous noise masks from real recordings. This approach expanded the training set while mitigating overfitting of background noise signatures. CNN models trained on the augmented dataset achieved high accuracy (96.2% true positive rate, 88.8% true negative rate) on non-homogeneous test data collected under different experimental conditions than the training, validation and testing data.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning Towards A Real-Time Spacecraft Thermal Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling thermal states for complex space missions, such as the surface exploration of airless bodies, requires high computation, whether used in ground-based analysis for spacecraft design or during onboard reasoning for autonomous operations. For example, a finite-element thermal model with hundreds of elements can take significant time to simulate, which makes it unsuitable for onboard reasoning during time-sensitive scenarios such as descent and landing, proximity operations, or in-space assembly. Further, the lack of fast and accurate thermal modeling drives thermal designs to be more conservative and leads to spacecraft with larger mass and higher power budgets. The emerging paradigm of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a class of hybrid modeling architectures that address this challenge by combining simplified physics models with machine learning (ML) models resulting in models which maintain both interpretability and robustness. Such techniques enable designs with reduced mass and power through onboard thermal-state estimation and control and may lead to improved onboard handling of off-nominal states, including unplanned down-time. The PIML model or hybrid model presented here consists of a neural network which predicts reduced nodalizations (distribution and size of coarse mesh) given on-orbit thermal load conditions, and subsequently a (relatively coarse) finite-difference model operates on this mesh to predict thermal states. We compare the computational performance and accuracy of the hybrid model to a data-driven neural net model, and a high-fidelity finite-difference model of a prototype Earth-orbiting small spacecraft. The PIML based active nodalization approach provides significantly better generalization than the neural net model and coarse mesh model, while reducing computing cost by up to 1.7x compared to the high-fidelity model.</description>

Abstract: Mining of formulaic alpha factors refers to the process of discovering and developing specific factors or indicators (referred to as alpha factors) for quantitative trading in stock market. To efficiently discover alpha factors in vast search space, reinforcement learning (RL) is commonly employed. This paper proposes a method to enhance existing alpha factor mining approaches by expanding a search space and utilizing pretrained formulaic alpha set as initial seed values to generate synergistic formulaic alpha. We employ information coefficient (IC) and rank information coefficient (Rank IC) as performance evaluation metrics for the model. Using CSI300 market data, we conducted real investment simulations and observed significant performance improvement compared to existing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Unleashing the synergies among rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder setting presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method that critically leverages large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with higher controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than that generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, this approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable transportation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent industrial applications in risk prediction still heavily rely on extensively manually-tuned, statistical learning methods. Real-world financial data, characterized by its high dimensionality, sparsity, high noise levels, and significant imbalance, poses unique challenges for the effective application of deep neural network models. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning risk prediction framework, FinLangNet, which conceptualizes credit loan trajectories in a structure that mirrors linguistic constructs. This framework is tailored for credit risk prediction using real-world financial data, drawing on structural similarities to language by adapting natural language processing techniques. It particularly emphasizes analyzing the development and forecastability of mid-term credit histories through multi-head and sequences of detailed financial events. Our research demonstrates that FinLangNet surpasses traditional statistical methods in predicting credit risk and that its integration with these methods enhances credit overdue prediction models, achieving a significant improvement of over 4.24\% in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Phase Field Simulations Through a Hybrid Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator with U-Net Backbone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prolonged contact between a corrosive liquid and metal alloys can cause progressive dealloying. For such liquid-metal dealloying (LMD) process, phase field models have been developed. However, the governing equations often involve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are challenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires an extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational bottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late time horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models capable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps at-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural operator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing local features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through a vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use U-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a later time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI) describing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal interface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately predict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model reproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy on-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the opportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in time using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that while advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO model in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid schemes.</description>

      <title>SimLOB: Learning Representations of Limited Order Book for Financial Market Simulation</title>

Abstract: Financial market simulation (FMS) serves as a promising tool for understanding market anomalies and the underlying trading behaviors. To ensure high-fidelity simulations, it is crucial to calibrate the FMS model for generating data closely resembling the observed market data. Previous efforts primarily focused on calibrating the mid-price data, leading to essential information loss of the market activities and thus biasing the calibrated model. The Limit Order Book (LOB) data is the fundamental data fully capturing the market micro-structure and is adopted by worldwide exchanges. However, LOB is not applicable to existing calibration objective functions due to its tabular structure not suitable for the vectorized input requirement. This paper proposes to explicitly learn the vectorized representations of LOB with a Transformer-based autoencoder. Then the latent vector, which captures the major information of LOB, can be applied for calibration. Extensive experiments show that the learned latent representation not only preserves the non-linear auto-correlation in the temporal axis, but the precedence between successive price levels of LOB. Besides, it is verified that the performance of the representation learning stage is consistent with the downstream calibration tasks.

Abstract: A backward stable numerical calculation of a function with condition number $\kappa$ will have a relative accuracy of $\kappa\epsilon_{\text{machine}}$. Standard formulations and software implementations of finite-strain elastic materials models make use of the deformation gradient $\boldsymbol F = I + \partial \boldsymbol u/\partial \boldsymbol X$ and Cauchy-Green tensors. These formulations are not numerically stable, leading to loss of several digits of accuracy when used in the small strain regime, and often precluding the use of single precision floating point arithmetic. We trace the source of this instability to specific points of numerical cancellation, interpretable as ill-conditioned steps. We show how to compute various strain measures in a stable way and how to transform common constitutive models to their stable representations, formulated in either initial or current configuration. The stable formulations all provide accuracy of order $\epsilon_{\text{machine}}$. In many cases, the stable formulations have elegant representations in terms of appropriate strain measures and offer geometric intuition that is lacking in their standard representation. We show that algorithmic differentiation can stably compute stresses so long as the strain energy is expressed stably, and give principles for stable computation that can be applied to inelastic materials.</description>

      <title>Correlations versus noise in the NFT market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-fungible token (NFT) market emerges as a recent trading innovation leveraging blockchain technology, mirroring the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. The current study is based on the capitalization changes and transaction volumes across a large number of token collections on the Ethereum platform. In order to deepen the understanding of the market dynamics, the collection-collection dependencies are examined by using the multivariate formalism of detrended correlation coefficient and correlation matrix. It appears that correlation strength is lower here than that observed in previously studied markets. Consequently, the eigenvalue spectra of the correlation matrix more closely follow the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, still, some departures indicating the existence of correlations remain. The comparison of results obtained from the correlation matrix built from the Pearson coefficients and, independently, from the detrended cross-correlation coefficients suggests that the global correlations in the NFT market arise from higher frequency fluctuations. Corresponding minimal spanning trees (MSTs) for capitalization variability exhibit a scale-free character while, for the number of transactions, they are somewhat more decentralized.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Global Carbon Inequality Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: International trading networks significantly influence global economic conditions and environmental outcomes. A notable imbalance between economic gains and emissions transfers persists, manifesting as carbon inequality. This study introduces a novel metric, the Ecological Economic Equality Index, integrated with complex network dynamics analysis, to quantitatively evaluate the evolving roles within the global trading network and to pinpoint inequities in trade relationships from 1995 to 2022. Utilising high spatiotemporal resolution data from the Environmentally Extended Multi-regional Input-output model, our findings reveal a widening disparity in carbon inequality and dynamic patterns. This analysis emphasises the gap in regional carbon inequality and identifies unequal trade. The study underscores that carbon inequality is a critical challenge affecting both developing and developed regions, demanding widespread attention and action.</description>

      <title>UniFIDES: Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equation Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of data-driven approaches for solving differential equations has been followed by a plethora of applications in science and engineering across a multitude of disciplines and remains a central focus of active scientific inquiry. However, a large body of natural phenomena incorporates memory effects that are best described via fractional integro-differential equations (FIDEs), in which the integral or differential operators accept non-integer orders. Addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear FIDEs is a recognized difficulty, necessitating the application of generic methods with immediate practical relevance. This work introduces the Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equation Solvers (UniFIDES), a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to expeditiously solve a variety of FIDEs in both forward and inverse directions, without the need for ad hoc manipulation of the equations. The effectiveness of UniFIDES is demonstrated through a collection of integer-order and fractional problems in science and engineering. Our results highlight UniFIDES' ability to accurately solve a wide spectrum of integro-differential equations and offer the prospect of using machine learning platforms universally for discovering and describing dynamical and complex systems.</description>
