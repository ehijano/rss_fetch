      <title>Electron and phonon topology in transition metal material TaSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plethora of multifold quasiparticles in topological materials has led to significant advancements in condensed matter physics, inspiring the investigation for materials that host both electronic and bosonic multifold excitations. In this work, we explore the electronic and phononic properties of TaSi, a non symmorphic chiral topological material crystallizing in space group P 2 1 3 (No. 198). This system exhibits multifold fermions, which are higher spin generalizations of Weyl fermions, protected by the unique crystalline symmetries of the structure. Using first principles calculations, we predict that electronic band possesses fourfold spin 3/2 Rarita Schwinger (RSW) fermions, sixfold excitations (double spin 1), all possessing large Chern numbers C = +4 and Weyl fermions of spin 1/2 with Chern no. -1 in the presence of spin orbit coupling (SOC). Additionally, the phononic band structure hosts chiral bosonic excitations characterized by Chern numbers C = +-2. The coexistence of chiral electronic and bosonic quasiparticles give rise to exotic transport phenomena, rendering the material as promising candidate for future applications in quantum materials, topological electronics, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computational framework for lattice dynamics and thermal transport including high-order anharmonicity: an application to cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting lattice thermal conductivity (kL) from first principles remains a challenge in identifying materials with extreme thermal behavior. While modern lattice dynamics methods enable routine predictions of kL within the harmonic approximation and three-phonon scattering framework (HA+3ph), reliable results, especially for low-kL compounds, require higher-order anharmonic effects, including self-consistent phonon renormalization, four-phonon scattering, and off-diagonal heat flux (SCPH+3,4ph+OD). We present a high-throughput workflow integrating these effects into a unified framework. Using this, we compute kL for 773 cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds across diverse chemistries and structures. From 562 dynamically stable compounds, we assess the hierarchical effects of higher-order anharmonicity. For about 60% of materials, HA+3ph predictions closely match those from SCPH+3,4ph+OD. However, SCPH corrections often increase kL, sometimes by over 8 times, while four-phonon scattering universally reduces it, occasionally to 15% of the HA+3ph value. Off-diagonal contributions are minor in high-kL systems but can exceed 50% of total kL in highly anharmonic, low-kL compounds. We highlight four cases-Rb2TlAlH6, Cu3VS4, CuBr, and Cl2O-exhibiting distinct anharmonic behaviors. This work delivers not only a robust workflow for high-fidelity kL dataset but also a quantitative framework to determine when higher-order effects are essential. The hierarchy of kL results, from the HA+3ph to SCPH+3,4ph+OD level, offers a scalable, interpretable route to discovering next-generation extreme thermal materials.</description>

      <title>MOFSimBench: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials In Metal--Organic Framework Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials, including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of uMLIPs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stabilization and electronic effects of oxygen vacancies at BiFeO$_3$ neutral ferroelectric domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO$_3$ has been widely observed, yet the microscopic origins of this effect, including electronic contributions from domain-wall defects, are incompletely understood at the atomistic level. Here, we carry out first-principles simulations to quantify the thermodynamic stability and electronic impact of oxygen vacancies at charge-neutral 71$^\circ$, 109$^\circ$, and 180$^\circ$ domain walls of BiFeO$_3$. We find that vacancies are energetically favored at domain walls by up to 0.3 eV compared to the bulk, leading to orders-of-magnitude increase in vacancy equilibrium concentration. The corresponding formation energy landscapes are discontinued and explained by local bond weakening. The vacancies induce localized electronic intragap states corresponding to small polarons, which promote thermally activated n-type conduction in the low-current regime, and their tendency to aggregate facilitate Schottky emission in the high-current regime. Our results provide a quantitative foundation for interpreting domain-wall conduction, offer guidance for defect engineering in ferroelectrics, and provide important information to phase-field simulations of defect-domain wall interactions in a ferroelectric domain structure.</description>

      <title>Single domain spectroscopic signatures of a magnetic Kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin- and orbital-resolved access to the electronic bands is necessary to establish key properties of quantum materials such as the quantum-geometric tensor. Despite recent revival on magnetic Kagome compounds, no spectroscopic access to their magnetic properties has been available so far due to small domain sizes and lack of appropriate techniques. Furthermore, their real space magnetic texture is often complex and temperature-dependent. We investigate the magnetic Kagome metal DyMn$_6$Sn$_6$ using high-resolution micro-focused circular-dichroic angle-resolved photoemission ($\mu$-CD-ARPES) to probe its magnetic and electronic properties. By tuning the kinetic energy to various features of the Dy $4f$ multiplet, we resolve magnetic domains in samples cryo-cooled down to 20 K. Smaller, but clear signatures are detected in the Mn $3p$ levels. The behavior of both Dy $4f$ and Mn $3p$ features are in remarkable agreement with our modeling based on the Hartree-Fock method, revealing ferrimagnetic alignment of Dy and Mn local moments, and further strengthening our interpretation. Adjusting the energy to the Mn $3d$-dominated valence bands reveals signatures which we relate to the orbital magnetization through a comparison to {\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations. Our study establishes the spectroscopic access to a single magnetic domain in a Kagome metal, paving the way for further research into imaging magnetic phases of novel magnetic materials using $\mu$-CD-ARPES.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in the photoelectron angular distribution of achiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism in the angular distribution (CDAD) is the effect that the angular intensity distribution of photoemitted electrons depends on the handedness of the incident circularly polarized light. A CDAD may arise from intrinsic material properties like chirality, spin-orbit interaction, or quantum-geometrical effects on the electronic structure. In addition, CDAD has also been reported for achiral organic molecules at the interface to metallic substrates. For this latter case, we investigate two prototypical $\pi$-conjugated molecules, namely tetracene and pentacene, whose frontier orbitals have a similar shape but exhibit distinctly different symmetries. By comparing experimental CDAD momentum maps with simulations within time-dependent density functional theory, we show how the final state of the photoelectron must be regarded as the source of the CDAD in such otherwise achiral systems. We gain additional insight into the mechanism by employing a simple scattering model for the final state, which allows us to decompose the CDAD signal into partial wave contributions.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic spin 3/2 nuclear quadrupole resonance: Spin relaxation and electric field gradient via Rabi frequency goniometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A straightforward way to determine the electric field gradient $-$ principal axes frame (EFG-PAF) on single crystal samples with spin 3/2 nuclei is demonstrated. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy is used to determine the Rabi frequency for $^{35}$Cl in a single crystal of potassium chlorate (KClO$_3$) by comparing the NQR signal for powder and single crystal samples. By exploiting the geometrical dependence of the Rabi frequency with respect to the excitation direction, EFG-PAF is readily determined. Furthermore, relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$ were measured at multiple temperatures ranging from $17~\textrm{K}$ to $200 ~$K, extending the results of previous works to colder temperatures where new relaxation mechanisms become dominant. The experiments were performed in a cryogen-free cryostat, which posed distinct challenges compared to a conventional cryogenic cooling setup. The successful operation of the NQR probe within a cryogen-free cryostat has the potential to make the technique more accessible and widen applications.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of flexoelectricity in MXene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate flexoelectricity in MXene monolayers from first principles. Specifically, we compute the transverse flexoelectric coefficients of 126 MXene monolayers along their two principal directions using Kohn-Sham density functional theory. The values span a wide range from 0.19$e$ to 1.3$e$ and are nearly isotropic with respect to bending direction. The transition metal is found to play a significant role in the flexoelectric response, with nitride-based MXenes consistently displaying larger coefficients than their carbide counterparts. Moreover, the coefficients increase with structural thickness, but when normalized by the bending modulus, which is also computed for all 126 monolayers, they exhibit the opposite trend.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and ferroelectric phase diagram of twisted CrI$_3$ layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisting layers provide a rich ore for exotic physics in low dimensions. Despite the abundant discoveries of twistronics from the aspect of electronic structures, ferroic moir\'e textures are more plain and thus less concerned. Rigid lattice models are straightforward which can give a rough but intuitional description in most cases. However, taking CrI$_3$ as a model system, here we will demonstrate that the interlayer stacking potential can spontaneously lead to structural relaxation, which plays a vital role to understand the ferroicity in the twisted superlattices. The magnetic ground state is sensitive to the stacking mode and twisting angles, which can be seriously affected by the structural relaxation. In particular, the expected magnetic bubbles are annihilated in its bilayer. In contrast, due to topological protection, the ferroelectric vortices are more robust to structural relaxation, as well as twisting angle and thickness.Due to the universal existence of spontaneous structural relaxation in twisted superlattices, our work may lead to a general revisitation of emerging physics of twistronics.</description>

      <title>Material-Limited Switching in Nanoscale Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferroelectric switching speed has been experimentally obfuscated by the interaction between the measurement circuit and the ferroelectric switching itself. This has prohibited the observation of real material responses at nanosecond timescales and lower. Here, fundamental polarization switching speeds in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite, fluorite, and wurtzite structures are reported. Upon lateral scaling of island capacitors from micron to nanoscales, a clear transition from circuit-limited switching to a material-limited switching regime is observed. In La$_{0.15}$Bi$_{0.85}$FeO$_{3}$ capacitors, switching is as fast as ~150 ps, the fastest switching time reported. For polycrystalline Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ capacitors, a fundamental switching limit of ~210 ps is observed. Switching times for Al$_{0.92}$B$_{0.08}$N are near 20 ns, limited by the coercive and breakdown electric fields. The activation field, instantaneous pseudo-resistivity, and energy-delay are reported in this material-limited regime. Lastly, a criterion for reaching the material-limited regime is provided. This regime enables observation of intrinsic material properties and favorable scaling trends for high-performance computing.</description>

      <title>Towards dislocation-driven quantum interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in the deployment of quantum technologies is the realization of robust architectures for quantum interconnects. We propose to engineer interconnects in semiconductors and insulators by patterning spin qubits at dislocations, thus forming quasi one-dimensional lines of entangled point defects. To gain insight into the feasibility and control of dislocation-driven interconnects, we investigate the optical cycle and coherence properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, in proximity of dislocations, using a combination of advanced first-principles calculations. We show that one can engineer spin defects with properties similar to those of their bulk counterparts, including charge stability and a favorable optical cycle, and that NV centers close to dislocations have much improved coherence properties. Finally, we predict optically detected magnetic resonance spectra that may facilitate the experimental identification of specific defect configurations. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the engineering of one-dimensional arrays of spin defects in the solid state.</description>

      <title>Revealing the impact of chemical short-range order on radiation damage in MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloys using a machine-learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of chemical short-range order (CSRO) on primary radiation damage in MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloys is investigated using hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations with a machine-learned potential. We show that CSRO enhances radiation tolerance by promoting interstitial diffusion while suppressing vacancy migration, thereby increasing defect recombination efficiency during recovery stage. However, CSRO is rapidly degraded under cumulative irradiation, with Warren-Cowley parameters dropping below 0.3 at a dose of only 0.03~dpa. This loss of ordering reduces the long-term enhancement of CSRO on radiation resistance. Our results highlight that while CSRO can effectively improve the radiation tolerance of MoNbTaVW, its stability under irradiation is critical to realizing and sustaining this benefit.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum materials: kagome, chiral, and square-net frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics as well as in materials science, with intriguing electronic states that are robust to perturbations. Among the diverse structural motifs, kagome, chiral, and square-net structures offer a wide range of topological phases and physical phenomena. These include Dirac and Weyl fermions, nodal-line semimetals, flat bands, van Hove singularities, charge density waves, superconductivity, nontrivial Berry phase, nonlinear electrical and thermal transports. This review explores the distinct roles of geometry, symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlations in these three classes of materials. It also highlights how their crystallographic features give rise to unique electronic band structures, topologically protected states and different physical properties, which require high-quality-single crystals. The present discussion comprises recent experimental discoveries and identification of the synthesis routes of key materials within each framework. Finally, the review outlines the current challenges and future directions in the design and exploration of topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Alkali doping of Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O alloys for $p$-type conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly all ultrawide-bandgap oxides are affected by hole localization that limits $p$-type conductivity and thus potential applications for these materials. Highly localized holes, also known as hole polarons, trap in the vicinity of acceptor dopants, giving rise to large ionization energies and severely constraining free hole concentrations. Though this hole-trapping behavior affects wurtzite zinc oxide, rocksalt zinc oxide was recently found to be resistant to the formation of hole polarons. Moreover, $p$-type doping using lithium acceptors was predicted to be achievable. While rocksalt zinc oxide is metastable and has a band gap near $\sim$3 eV, here it is found that zinc magnesium oxide (Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O) alloys remain $p$-type dopable within the stable rocksalt crystal structure, in addition to exhibiting band gaps in excess of 4 eV. As in rocksalt zinc oxide, alkali acceptors are shallow in zinc magnesium oxide and do not appear to be affected by donor compensation. These results indicate that alkali-doped Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O alloys are a promising system for achieving a $p$-type dopable ultrawide-bandgap oxide.</description>

      <title>Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact (trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dual Effect of L-Cysteine on the Reorientation and Relaxation of Fe3O4-Decorated Graphene Oxide Liquid Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we study the dynamics of Fe3O4-decorated L-Cysteine-functionalized GOLC director under an external magnetic field and analyze L-Cysteine's influence on the reorientation and relaxation time of the director. In particular, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by solution-combustion method and added for altering orientational properties of GO which we synthesized electrochemically and functionalized by L-Cysteine. In addition, a comprehensive comparison of the director behaviour of GOLC and Fe3O4-decorated L-Cysteine-GOLC was undertaken to verify the tunability of the aforementioned systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate dual-effect of L-Cysteine on the magnetic field-induced alignment and relaxation time of GOLC systems, namely decrease in reorientation time and at the same time increase in relaxation time. Besides, micropattern creation and controlling in the drying drops of GOLC (net- and knit-like, flower-like, radial- and parallel-strip etc.) using a magnetic field were shown. The results of our studies could facilitate the fabrication of ordered and patterned tunable GOLC assemblies for a range of advanced applications.

      <title>Electrically tunable heavy fermion and quantum criticality in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems. Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds. While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Guided Symbolic Regression for Interpretable Descriptor Discovery in Perovskite Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Utilizing a machine-learned potential to explore enhanced radiation tolerance in the MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on tungsten (W) have emerged as promising candidates for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors, owing to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this study, we construct an efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the MoNbTaVW quinary system. This potential achieves computational speeds comparable to the embedded-atom method (EAM) potential, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the primary radiation damage through molecular dynamics simulations. Threshold displacement energies (TDEs) in the MoNbTaVW HEA are investigated and compared with pure metals. A series of displacement cascade simulations at primary knock-on atom energies ranging from 10 to 150 keV reveal significant differences in defect generation and clustering between MoNbTaVW HEA and pure W. In HEAs, we observe more surviving Frenkel pairs (FPs) but fewer and smaller interstitial clusters compared to W, indicating superior radiation tolerance. We propose extended damage models to quantify the radiation dose in the MoNbTaVW HEA, and suggest that one reason for their enhanced resistance is subcascade splitting, which reduces the formation of interstitial clusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the fundamental irradiation resistance mechanisms in refractory body-centered cubic alloys, offering guidance for the design of future radiation-tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of topology by electric field in breathing kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome lattices have attracted much attention recently due to the interplay of band topology with magnetism and electronic correlations, which give rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. A common structural distortion of the kagome lattice is the breathing mode, which can significantly influence the magnetism and band characteristics. However, the modulation of breathing mode and the associated topological phenomena remain rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate that the coupling of breathing modes with ferroelectricity, magnetism, and band topology in the M3X8 monolayer system enables electric field manipulation of topological spin structure and electronic states. The breathing mode mainly occurs in materials containing early 4d/5d transition metal elements and can be reversed or even suppressed via ferroelectric switching in low-barrier materials. Importantly, electric field-induced switching of the breathing mode can alter the chirality of the topological spin structure, or trigger a transition from a topological trivial insulator to a Chern insulator. This work paves the way for exploring novel physical phenomena driven by breathing modes in kagome materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents generated via the nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) exhibit significant potential for spintronics applications, with both computational and experimental validations. Addressing the scarcity of conductive altermagnets, we propose strain engineering as a reliable method for inducing altermagnetism. Focusing on rutile-structured $\mathrm{OsO}_2$, first-principles calculations show that minor equibiaxial tensile strain ($\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$=3\%) induces nonmagnetic-to-altermagnetic transitions, achieving an ASSE-driven spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim$7\% -- far surpassing conventional spin Hall angles ($\theta_{\text{IS}}$). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to nonrelativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's nonrelativistic origin. Further investigation reveals that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>SymPlex Plots for Visualizing Properties in High-Dimensional Alloy Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional visualization tools such as phase diagrams and convex hulls are ill-suited to visualize multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs) due to their large compositional space that cannot be easily projected onto two dimensions. Here, SymPlex plots are introduced to enable the visualization of various properties along special paths in high-dimensional phase spaces of MPEAs. These are polar heatmaps that plot properties along high-symmetry paths radiating from the parent equimolar MPEA to a set of chosen lower-order compositions. SymPlex plots capture the changes in the energy landscape along the special paths and help visualize the effect of addition or substitution of components on the alloy stability, which can be especially useful to assess processing pathways for additive manufacturing. Thus, SymPlex plots can help guide design of MPEAs by showing connections between compositions and their properties in the high-dimensional phase space with more information concentrated near the equimolar region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For all collinear altermagnets, we sort out piezomagnetic free-energy invariants allowed in the nonrelativistic limit and relativistic piezomagnetic invariants bilinear in the N\'eel vector $\mathbf{L}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, which include strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The symmetry-allowed responses are fully determined by the nonrelativistic spin Laue group. In the nonrelativistic limit, two distinct mechanisms are discussed: the band-filling mechanism, which exists in metals and is illustrated using the simple two-dimensional Lieb lattice model, and the temperature-dependent exchange-driven mechanism, which is illustrated using first-principles calculations for transition-metal fluorides. The leading second-order nonrelativistic term in the strain-induced magnetization is also obtained for CrSb. Piezomagnetism due to the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is calculated from first principles for transition-metal fluorides, MnTe, and CrSb. Finally, we discuss triplet superconducting correlations supported by altermagnets and protected by inversion rather than time-reversal symmetry. We apply the nonrelativistic classification of Cooper pairs to describe the interplay between strain and superconductivity in the two-dimensional Lieb lattice and in bulk rutile structures. We show that triplet superconductivity is, on average, unitary in an unstrained altermagnet, but becomes non-unitary under piezomagnetically active strain.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Anisotropic Magnetoresistance with Collinear and Non-Collinear Magnetic Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) arises from symmetry lowering of the conductivity tensor induced by magnetic order. In simple ferromagnets, AMR is a relativistic effect, relying on spin-orbit interaction (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a comparable symmetry lowering can also occur in a non-relativistic limit. Using tight-binding models, density functional theory calculations, and Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate systems with multiple magnetic sublattices, including both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnets, as well as ferrimagnetic configurations. We show that AMR and related anisotropies can emerge purely from magnetic order, without the need for SOC, and may reach significant magnitudes. The findings are supported by case studies on toy-model lattices and real materials such as MnN, Mn$_3$Sn, and are further interpreted using a symmetry analysis based on Neumann's principle. Material candidates that exhibit non-relativistic anisotropic magnetoresistance are identified by symmetry analysis applied to entries in the MAGNDATA database.</description>

Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides (TMO) are widely used as cathode materials in Na/Li batteries. The open-circuit voltage (OCV), which determines the energy density (together with capacity), is among the key physical and chemical factors influencing the performance of cathodes. The shape of the voltage profile is also influenced by the formation energy of intermediate phases during cycling. From a theoretical perspective, the formation energy (and voltage) are defined as internal energy differences between phases. Therefore, an accurate prediction of internal energy is crucial for the calculation of OCV. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that decomposes the internal energy of a given TMO into distinct contributions with clear physical significance. Specifically, we break down the energy into parameters that can be more easily calculated (compared to DFT) and obtained from experimental databases. From these parameters, we define a potential term that can be calculated for different compositions, and can be used for calculation of voltage profile</description>

Abstract: The development of modern metal deposition techniques like Focused Ion/Electron Beam Induced Deposition FIBID/FEBID relies heavily on the availability of metal-organic precursors of particular properties. To create a new precursor, extensive testing under specialized gas injection systems is required along with time-consuming and costly chemical analysis typically conducted using scanning electron microscopes. This process can be quite challenging due to its complexity and expense. Here, the response of new metal-organic precursors, in the form of supported thick layers, to the ion beam irradiation is studied through analysis of the chemical composition and morphology of the resulting structures. This is done using SEM BSE/EDX along with Machine Learning data processing techniques. This approach enables a comprehensive fast examination of precursor decomposition processes during FIB irradiation, and provides valuable insights into how the precursor's composition influences the final properties of the metal-rich deposits. Although solid-layer irradiation differs from gas-phase deposition, we think that our method, can be employed to optimize pre-screen and score new potential precursors for FIB applications by significantly reducing the time required and conserving valuable resources.</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. We show that active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic, signed parameter with units of curvature which we call curvity, that can be derived from first principles. Experiments with robots and numerical simulations show that properties of individual robots (radius and curvity) control pair cohesion in a binary system, and the stability of flocking and self-limiting clustering in a swarm, with applications in meta-materials and in embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional, time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Assisted Fourier Analysis for High-Efficiency Structural Design: A Case Study on Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric design of structures with optimized physical and chemical properties is one of the core topics in materials science. However, designing new functional materials is challenging due to the vast number of existing and the possible unknown structures to be enumerated and difficulties in mining the underlying correlations between structures and their properties. Here, we propose a universal method for periodic structural design and property optimization. The key in our approach is a deep-learning assisted inverse Fourier transform, which enables the creation of arbitrary geometries within crystallographic space groups. It effectively explores extensive parameter spaces to identify ideal structures with desired properties. Taking the research of three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures as a case study, this method is capable of modelling numerous structures and identifying their photonic bandgaps in just a few hours. We confirmed the established knowledge that the widest photonic bandgaps exist in network morphologies, among which the single diamond (dia net) reigns supreme. Additionally, this method identified a rarely-known lcs topology with excellent photonic properties, highlighting the infinitely extensible application boundaries of our approach. This work demonstrates the high efficiency and effectiveness of the Fourier-based method, advancing material design and providing insights for next-generation functional materials.</description>

      <title>Twist, splay, and uniform domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The newly-discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal exhibits a variety of unique defect phenomena. The depolarization field in the material favors spontaneous spatial variations in polarization, manifesting in diverse forms such as bulk twists and arrangements of alternating polarization domains. The configuration of these domains is governed by a balance between depolarization field reduction and molecular alignment at interfaces. We investigate a ferroelectric nematic confined in a thin cell with apolar surface anchoring, patterned using photoalignment. Under uniform planar alignment, the system forms stripes, while a radial +1 defect pattern results in pie-slice domains. Neighboring domains show either opposite directions of uniform polarization (thin cells) or opposite handedness of the spontaneous twist (thick cells). Our calculations and experiments demonstrate that electrostatic interactions tend to shrink domain size, whereas elastic and surface anchoring effects promote larger domains. In this work, we make predictions and measurements of the domain size as a function of cell thickness, and show that ionic screening suppresses domain formation.</description>

      <title>A low-background setup for in-situ X-ray total scattering combined with fast scanning calorimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

      <title>Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: Theoretical Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc. Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.</description>
