      <title>Detection of the Temperature Dependence of the White Dwarf Mass-Radius Relation with Gravitational Redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models predict that the well-studied mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars depends on the temperature of the star, with hotter white dwarfs having larger masses at a given radius than cooler stars. In this paper, we use a catalog of 26,041 DA white dwarfs observed in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Releases 1-19. We measure the radial velocity, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius for each object. By binning this catalog in radius or surface gravity, we average out the random motion component of the radial velocities for nearby white dwarfs to isolate the gravitational redshifts for these objects and use them to directly measure the mass-radius relation. For gravitational redshifts measured from binning in either radius or surface gravity, we find strong evidence for a temperature-dependent mass-radius relation, with warmer white dwarfs consistently having greater gravitational redshifts than cool objects at a fixed radius or surface gravity. For warm white dwarfs, we find that their mean radius is larger and mean surface gravity is smaller than those of cool white dwarfs at 5.2{\sigma} and 6.0{\sigma} significance, respectively. Selecting white dwarfs with similar radii or surface gravities, the significance of the difference in mean gravitational redshifts between the warm and cool samples is &gt;6.1{\sigma} and &gt;3.6{\sigma} for measurements binned in radius and surface gravity, respectively, in the direction predicted by theory. This is an improvement over previous implicit detections, and our technique can be expanded to precisely test the white dwarf mass-radius relation with future surveys.</description>

      <title>Correlations Between the Neutron Star Mass-Radius Relation and the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytic method of inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) relations to high accuracy. This method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5\% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <title>Coronal kink oscillations and photospheric driving: combining SolO/EUI and SST/CRISP high-resolution observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driving and excitation mechanisms of decay-less kink oscillations in coronal loops remain under debate. We aim to quantify and provide simple observational constraints on the photospheric driving of oscillating coronal loops in a few typical active region configurations: sunspot, plage, pores and enhanced-network regions. We then aim to investigate the possible interplay between photospheric driving and properties of kink oscillations in connected coronal loops. We analyse two unique datasets of the corona and photosphere taken at a high resolution during the first coordinated observation campaign between Solar Orbiter and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A local correlation tracking method is applied on the SST/CRISP data to quantify the photospheric motions at the base of coronal loops. The same loops are then analysed in the corona by exploiting data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on Solar Orbiter, and by using a wavelet analysis to characterize the kink oscillations. Each photospheric region shows dynamics with an overall increase in strength going from pore, plage, enhanced-network to sunspot regions. Differences are also seen in the kink-mode amplitudes of the corresponding coronal loops. This suggests the photosphere is involved in the driving of coronal kink oscillations. However, the few samples available does not allow to further establish the excitation mechanism yet. Despite oscillating coronal loops being anchored in seemingly "static" strong magnetic field regions as seen from coronal EUV observations, photospheric observations provide evidence for a continuous and significant driving at their base. The precise connection between photospheric driving and coronal kink oscillations remains to be further investigated. This study finally provides critical constraints on photospheric driving that can be tested in existing numerical models of coronal loops.</description>

      <title>Astrometry-Only Detection of Microlensing Events with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometric microlensing events occur when a massive object passes between a distant source and the observer, causing a shift of the light centroid. The precise astrometric measurements of the Gaia mission provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect and analyze these events, revealing properties of lensing objects such as their mass and distance. We develop and test the Gaia Astrometric Microlensing Events (GAME) Filter, a software tool to identify astrometric microlensing events and derive lensing object properties. We generated mock Gaia observations for different magnitudes, number of Gaia visits, and events extending beyond Gaia's observational run. We applied GAME Filter to these datasets and validated its performance. We also assessed the rate of false positives where binary astrometric systems are misidentified as microlensing events. GAME Filter successfully recovers microlensing parameters for strong events. Parameters are more difficult to recover for short events and those extending beyond Gaia's run, where only a fraction of the events is observed. The astrometric effect breaks the degeneracy in the microlensing parallax present in photometric microlensing. For fainter sources, the observed signal weakens, reducing recovered events and increasing parameter errors. However, even for Gaia G-band magnitude 19, parameters can be recovered for Einstein radii above two mas. Observing regions with varying numbers of Gaia visits has minimal impact on filter accuracy when the number of visits exceeds 90. Additionally, even if the peak of a microlensing event lies outside Gaia's run, microlensing parameters can still be recovered. We also tested the sensitivity to contamination and found that 5 percent of binary systems were misclassified. GAME Filter characterizes lenses with astrometry-only data for lens masses from approximately 1 to 20 solar masses and distances up to 6 kpc.</description>

      <title>The source of the 2017 cosmic ray half-year modulation event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, as the solar cycle approached solar minimum, an unusually long and large depression was observed in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) protons, detected with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02), lasting for the second half of that year. The depression, as seen in the Bartel rotation-averaged proton flux, has the form of a Forbush decrease (FD). Despite this resemblance, however, the cause of the observed depression does not have such a simple explanation as FDs, due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), typically last for a few days at 1 AU rather than half a year. In this work, we seek the cause of the observed depression and investigate two main possibilities. First, we consider a mini-cycle - a temporary change in the solar dynamo that changes the behavior of the global solar magnetic field and, by this, the modulation of GCRs. Secondly, we investigate the behavior of solar activity, both CMEs and co-rotating/stream interactions regions (C/SIRs), during this period. Our findings show that, although there is some evidence for mini-cycle behavior prior to the depression, the depression is ultimately due to a combination of recurrent CMEs, SIRs and CIRs. A particular characteristic of the depression is that the largest impacts that help to create and maintain it are due to four CMEs from the same, highly active, magnetic source that persists for several solar rotations. This active magnetic source is unusual given the closeness of the solar cycle to solar minimum, which also helps to make the depression more evident.</description>

      <title>The impact of rotation on the stochastic excitation of stellar acoustic modes in solar-like pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational results from asteroseismic studies show that an important fraction of solar-like stars do not present detectable stochastically excited acoustic oscillations. This non-detectability seems to correlate with a high rotation rate in the convective envelope and a high surface magnetic activity. At the same time, the properties of stellar convection are affected by rotation and magnetism. We investigate the role of rotation in the excitation of acoustic modes in the convective envelope of solar-like stars, to evaluate its impact on the energy injected in the oscillations. We derive theoretical prescriptions for the excitation of acoustic waves in the convective envelope of rotating solar-like stars. We adopt the Rotating Mixing-Length Theory to model the influence of rotation on convection. We use the MESA stellar evolution code and the GYRE stellar oscillation code to estimate the power injected in the oscillations from our theoretical prescriptions. We demonstrate that the power injected in the acoustic modes is insensitive to the rotation if a Gaussian time-correlation function is assumed, while it can decrease by up to 60 % for a Lorentzian time-correlation function, for a $20 \Omega_{\odot}$ rotation rate. This result can allow us to better constrain the properties of stellar convection by studying observationally acoustic modes excitation. These results demonstrate how important it is to take into account the modification of stellar convection by rotation when evaluating the amplitude of the stellar oscillations it stochastically excites. They open the path for understanding the large variety of observed acoustic-mode amplitudes at the surface of solar-like stars as a function of surface rotation rates.</description>

      <title>Spin-down of solar-mass protostars in magnetospheric accretion paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar spin is one of the fundamental quantities that characterize a star itself and its planetary system. Nevertheless, stellar spin-down mechanisms in protostellar and pre-main-sequence stellar phases have been a long-standing problem in the star formation theory. To realize the spin-down, previous axisymmetric models based on the conventional magnetospheric paradigm have to assume massive stellar winds or produce highly time-variable magnetospheric ejections. However, this picture has been challenged by both numerical simulations and observations. With a particular focus on the propeller regime for solar-mass stars, we propose a new picture of stellar spin-down based on our recent three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulation and stellar evolution calculation. We show that failed magnetospheric winds, unique to 3D models, significantly reduce the spin-up accretion torque, which make it easier for the star to spin-down. Additionally, the amplitude of time variability associated with magnetospheric ejections is reduced by 3D effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the star spins down by generating a conical disk wind, driven by a rotating stellar magnetosphere. Our theoretical estimates, inspired by the numerical model, suggest that the conical disk wind is likely to play a crucial role in extracting stellar angular momentum during the protostellar phase. As magnetospheric accretion is expected to occur in other accreting objects such as proto-giant planets, this study will also contribute to the understanding of the angular momentum of such objects.</description>

      <title>Glitches in solar-like oscillating F-type stars: Possible contribution of non-linear terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The glitch signatures in $r_{010}$ for F-type stars (higher amplitude and period of the oscillatory component) are very different from those of G-type stars. The aim of this work is to analyse the signatures of these glitches and understand the origin of the differences in these signatures between G-type and F-type stars. We fit the glitch signatures in the frequencies, second differences, and $r_{010}$ ratios while assuming either a sinusoidal variation or a more complex expression. The fit provides the acoustic depth, and hence the position, of the bottom of the convective envelope for nine \textit{Kepler} stars and the Sun. We find that for F-type stars, the most commonly used fitting expressions for the glitch of the bottom of the convective envelope provide different measurements of the position of the bottom of the convective envelope for the three seismic indicators, while it is not the case for G-type stars. When adding an additional term in the fitting expression with twice the acoustic depth of the standard term (a contribution that accounts for the highly non-sinusoidal shape of the signature in the $r_{010}$ ratios), we find better agreement between the three seismic indicators and with the prediction of stellar evolution models. While the origin of this additional term is not yet understood, this may be an indication that the transition between the convective envelope and the underlying radiative zone is different for G- and F-type stars. This outcome brings new insight into the physics in these regions.</description>

      <title>Cyclotron emitting magnetic white dwarfs in post common envelope binaries discovered with the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 14 new (and recovery of 4 known) low accretion rate magnetic white dwarfs in post-common envelope binaries that emit strong cyclotron emission using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, doubling the known sample size. In addition, we discovered a candidate magnetic period bouncer and recovered three known ones. We confirmed the presence of cyclotron emission using low-resolution spectra in 19 objects. Using the ZTF light curves, follow-up spectra, and the spectral energy distribution, we measured the orbital period, magnetic field strength, and white dwarf temperature of each system. Although the phase-folded light curves have diverse shapes and show a much larger variability amplitude, we show that their intrinsic properties (e.g. period distribution, magnetic field strength) are similar to those of previously known systems. The diversity in light curve shapes can be explained by differences in the optical depth of the accretion spot and geometric differences, the inclination angle and the magnetic spot latitude. The evolutionary states of the longer period binaries are somewhat uncertain but are vary; we found systems consistent with being pre-polars, detached polars, or low-state polars. In addition, we discovered two new low-state polars that likely have brown dwarf companions and could be magnetic period bouncers.</description>

      <title>Simulation of thermal conduction by asymmetric dark matter in realistic stars and planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter captured in stars can act as an additional heat transport mechanism, modifying fusion rates and asteroseismoloigcal observables. Calculations of heat transport rates rely on approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equation, which have never been verified in realistic stars. Here, we simulate heat transport in the Sun, the Earth, and a brown dwarf model, using realistic radial temperature, density, composition and gravitational potential profiles. We show that the formalism developed in arXiv:2111.06895 remains accurate across all celestial objects considered, across a wide range of kinematic regimes, for both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions where scattering with multiple species becomes important. We further investigate evaporation rates of dark matter from the Sun, finding that previous calculations appear robust. Our Monte Carlo simulation software Cosmion is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): Dynamical Evidence of a Spiral-Arm-Driving and Gap-Opening Protoplanet from SAO 206462 Spiral Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early stages of planetary system formation, young exoplanets gravitationally interact with their surrounding environments and leave observable signatures on protoplanetary disks. Among these structures, a pair of nearly symmetric spiral arms can be driven by a giant protoplanet. For the double-spiraled SAO 206462 protoplanetary disk, we obtained three epochs of observations spanning 7 yr using the Very Large Telescope's SPHERE instrument in near-infrared $J$-band polarized light. By jointly measuring the motion of the two spirals at three epochs, we obtained a rotation rate of $-0.85^\circ\pm0.05^\circ~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This rate corresponds to a protoplanet at $66\pm3$ au on a circular orbit dynamically driving both spirals. The derived location agrees with the gap in ALMA dust-continuum observations, indicating that the spiral driver may also carve the observed gap. What is more, a dust filament at $\sim$63 au observed by ALMA coincides with the predicted orbit of the spiral-arm-driving protoplanet. This double-spiraled system is an ideal target for protoplanet imaging.</description>

Abstract: We present high resolution WIYN/NEID echelle spectroscopy (R $\approx70$,000) of the supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, obtained 1.51 to 18.51 days after explosion over nine epochs. Daily monitoring for the first four days after explosion shows narrow emission features ($\leq200$ km s$^{-1}$), exhibiting predominantly blueshifted velocities, that rapidly weaken, broaden, and vanish in a manner consistent with radiative acceleration and the SN shock eventually overrunning or enveloping the full extent of dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The most rapid evolution is in the He I emission, which is visible on day 1.51 but disappears by day 2.62. We measure the maximum pre-SN speed of He I to be 25 $^{+0}_{-5} \pm2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the error is attributable to the uncertainty in how much the He I had already been radiatively accelerated, and to measurement of the emission line profile. The radiative acceleration of material is likely driven by the shock-CSM interaction, and the CSM is accelerated to $\geq200$ km s$^{-1}$ before being completely swept up by the SN shock to $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$. We compare the observed spectra with spherically-symmetric r16wb HERACLES/CMFGEN model spectra and find the line evolution to generally be consistent with radiative acceleration and optical depth effects. The progenitor of SN2023ixf underwent an enhanced mass loss phase $\gtrsim 4$ year prior to core-collapse, creating a dense, asymmetric CSM region extending out to approximately $r_{CSM} = 3.7 \times 10^{14}$ ($v_\textrm{shock}$/9500 km s$^{-1}$) cm.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from the detection of wide companions by radial velocity and astrometry</title>

Abstract: The detection and constraint of the orbits of long-period giant planets is essential for enabling their further study through direct imaging. Recently, Venner et al. (2024) highlighted discrepancies between the solutions presented by Feng et al. (2022) and those from other studies, which primarily use orvara. We address these concerns by reanalyzing the data for HD 28185, GJ 229, HD 211847, GJ 680, HD 111031, and eps Ind A, offering explanations for these discrepancies. Based on a comparison between the methods used by Feng et al. (2022) and orvara, we find the discrepancies are primarily data-related rather than methodology-related. Our re-analysis of HD 28185 highlights many of the data-related issues and particularly the importance of parallax modeling for year-long companions. The case of eps Ind A b is instructive to emphasize the value of an extended RV baseline for accurately determining orbits of long period companions. Our orbital solutions highlight other causes for discrepancies between solutions including the combination of absolute and relative astrometry, clear definitions of conventions, and efficient posterior sampling for the detection of wide-orbit giant planets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Near-Infrared Features of Kilonovae: The Importance of Gadolinium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of the kilonova AT2017gfo and investigations of its light curves and spectra confirmed that neutron star mergers are sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the identification of elements responsible for the spectral features is still challenging, particularly at the near-infrared wavelengths. In this study, we systematically searched for all possible near-infrared transitions of heavy elements using experimentally calibrated energy levels. Our analysis reveals that most candidate elements with strong absorption lines are lanthanides (Z=57-71) and actinides (Z=89-103). This is due to their complex structures leading to many low-lying energy levels, which results in strong transitions in the near-infrared range. Domoto et al. (2022) have shown that La III and Ce III can explain the absorption features at $\lambda\sim$ 12,000 - 15,000 A. While our results confirm that these two elements show strong infrared features, we additionally identify Gd III as the next most promising species. Due to its unique atomic structure involving the half-filled 4f and the outer 5d orbitals, Gd III has one of the lowest-lying energy levels, between which relatively strong transitions occur. We also find absorption lines caused by Gd III in the near-infrared spectrum of a chemically peculiar star HR 465, which supports their emergence in kilonova spectra. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we confirm that Gd III lines affect the feature at $\sim$ 12,000 A previously attributed to La III. Future space-based time-series observations of kilonova spectra will allow the identification of Gd III lines.</description>

      <title>Influence of ICME-driven Magnetic Cloud-like and Sheath Region induced Geomagnetic Storms in causing anomalous responses of the Low-latitude Ionosphere: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic conditions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06$^\circ$N, 72.54$^\circ$E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20$^\circ$), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It is shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it is the non-fluctuating southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind variations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background and Neutrino Non-Radiative Decay: a Bayesian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos being massive could undergo non-radiative decay, a property for which the diffuse supernova neutrino background has a unique sensitivity. We extend previous analyses to explore our ability to disentangle predictions for the diffuse supernova neutrino background in presence or absence of neutrino non-radiative two-body decay. In a three-neutrino framework, we give predictions of the corresponding neutrino fluxes and the expected number of events in the Super-Kamiokande+Gadolinium, the Hyper-Kamiokande, the JUNO and the DUNE experiments. In our analysis, we employ supernova simulations from different groups and include current uncertainties from both the evolving core-collapse supernova rate and the fraction of failed supernovae. We perform the first Bayesian analysis to see our ability to disentangle the cases in presence and absence of neutrino decay. To this aim we combine the expected events in inverse beta-decay and the neutrino-argon detection channels. We also discuss neutrino-electron, neutrino-proton and of neutrino-oxygen scattering. Our investigation covers the different possible decay patterns for normal mass ordering, both strongly-hierarchical and quasi-degenerate as well as the inverted neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Disk Structure Rrevealed by the Mono-age Populations of the LAMOST Red Clump Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of the Galactic disk is crucial for understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way. This study examines the structure of the Galactic disk by analyzing a sample of 138,667 primary red clump (RC) stars from the LAMOST and Gaia datasets. We have categorized these RC stars into mono-age populations and investigated their spatial distributions within the R - Z plane, estimating scale heights and lengths through the fitting of their vertical and radial density profiles. Our analysis indicates that the vertical profiles of these mono-age populations fit a dual-component disk model, where both components exhibit significant flaring, particularly in the outer disk regions. Within a constant Galactocentric radius R, the scale heights of the first component, representing the morphologically thin disk, rise with age. In contrast, the scale heights of the second component, corresponding to the morphologically thick disk, remain comparatively stable across different age groups. Additionally, the radial density profiles of both disk components predominantly peak within a radial range of 7.5-8.5 kpc. These findings underscore the importance of age as a crucial factor in shaping the spatial distribution and structural evolution of the Galactic disk, offering valuable insights into its complex dynamics and history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10$ MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Formation of supermassive stars and dense star clusters in metal-poor clouds exposed to strong FUV radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct collapse scenario, which predicts the formation of supermassive stars (SMSs) as precursors to supermassive black holes (SMBHs), has been explored primarily under the assumption of metal-free conditions. However, environments exposed to strong far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, which is another requirement for the direct collapse, are often chemically enriched to varying degrees. In this study, we perform radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star-cluster formation in clouds with finite metallicities, $Z=10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, incorporating detailed thermal and chemical processes and radiative feedback from forming stars. Extending the simulations to approximately two million years, we demonstrate that SMSs with masses exceeding $10^4~M_\odot$ can form even in metal-enriched clouds with $Z \lesssim 10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$. The accretion process in these cases, driven by "super-competitive accretion," preferentially channels gas into central massive stars in spite of small (sub-pc) scale fragmentation. At $Z \simeq 10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, however, enhanced cooling leads to intense fragmentation on larger scales, resulting in the formation of dense star clusters dominated by very massive stars with $10^3 M_{\odot}$ rather than SMSs. These clusters resemble young massive or globular clusters observed in the distant and local universe, exhibiting compact morphologies and high stellar surface densities. Our findings suggest that SMS formation is viable below a metallicity threshold of approximately $10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$, significantly increasing the number density of massive seed black holes to levels sufficient to account for the ubiquitous SMBHs observed in the local universe. Moreover, above this metallicity, this scenario naturally explains the transition from SMS formation to dense stellar cluster formation.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the origin of the broken misaligned circumtriple disk around GW Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the origin of the observed misaligned rings in the circumtriple disk around GW Ori. Previous studies appeared to disagree on whether disk breaking is caused by the differential precession driven in the disk by the triple star system. In this letter, we show that the previous studies are in agreement with each other when using the same set of parameters. But for observationally motivated parameters of a typical protoplanetary disk, the disk is unlikely to break due to interactions with the triple star system. We run 3-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a circumtriple disk around GW Ori with different disk aspect ratios. For a disk aspect ratio typical of protoplanetary disks, $H/r \gtrsim 0.05$, the disk does not break. An alternative scenario for the gap's origin consistent with the expected disk aspect ratio involves the presence of giant circumtriple planets orbiting GW Ori.</description>

      <title>Polytropic Gas Effects in Parker's Solar Wind Model and Coronal Hole Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed and systematic investigation of polytropic gas effects in Parker's solar wind model and coronal-hole flows is given. We present a viable equation governing the acceleration of solar wind of a polytropic gas and give its exact analytical and numerical solutions and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties (i) near the sun, (ii) far away from the sun, (iii) near the Parker sonic critical point (where the wind speed is equal to the speed of sound in the wind). We proceed to give a detailed and systematic investigation of coronal-hole polytropic gas outflows which contribute to bulk of the solar wind. We will model coronal-hole outflow by considering a single radial stream tube and invoke phenomenological considerations to represent its rapidly-diverging flow geometry. We give analytical and numerical solutions for this outflow and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties in the three flow regimes above. We find that, in general, the polytropic effects cause the Parker sonic critical point to move closer to the sun than that for the case with isothermal gas. Furthermore, the flow acceleration is found to exhibit (even for an infinitesimal deviation from isothermality of the gas) a power-law behavior rather than an exponential-law behavior near the sun or a logarithmic-law behavior far away from the sun, thus implying a certain robustness of the power-law behavior. The Parker sonic critical point is shown to continue to be of X-type, hence facilitating a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic wind flow through the transonic regime. Our analytical and numerical solutions for coronal-hole outflows show that the super-radiality of the stream tube causes the Parker sonic critical point to move further down in the corona, and the gas to become more diabatic (the polytropic exponent $\gamma$ drops further below 5/3), and the flow acceleration to be enhanced further.</description>

      <title>Effect of Turbulent Kinetic Helicity on Diffusive beta effect for Large Scale Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated a plasma system with kinematic viscosity ($\nu = 0.006$) and magnetic diffusivity ($\eta = 0.006$), driven by helical kinetic energy, to study the dynamics of energy and helicity in magnetic diffusion. Using the numerical data obtained, we explored methods to determine the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients that linearize the nonlinear electromotive force (EMF) and the dynamo process. Initially, we applied conventional statistical approaches such as mean-field theory (MFT), direct interaction approximation (DIA), and eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure. We then proposed a simpler alternative method using large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data to calculate $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Our findings show that while $\alpha$ qualitatively aligns with theoretical predictions, $\beta$ remains negative, indicating an inverse cascade of energy through magnetic diffusion. This deviated from conventional models and was further analyzed using a recursive method in the second moment identity, revealing that small-scale kinetic helicity couples with large-scale current density to transport energy inversely. We validated our method by reproducing the numerically calculated data. The consistency between our method and direct numerical simulations (DNS) suggests that the negative diffusion process in plasma has a physical basis.</description>

      <title>The Decline and Fall of ROME. V. A Preliminary Search for Star-Disrupted Planet Interactions and Coronal Activity at 5 GHz Among White Dwarfs within 25 pc</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs has renewed interest in the final chapters of the evolution of planetary systems. Although observational and theoretical studies have examined the dynamical evolution of these systems, studies of their magnetic star-planet interactions, as powered by unipolar induction, have thus far only been assessed theoretically. This fifth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted mini-survey of nine white dwarfs within 25 pc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated by magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants. This $\sim$5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity over $&lt;$1 s integration times. Although no exoplanet-induced stellar radio flares were detected, this is the first survey to search for magnetic star-planet interactions between white dwarfs and planetary companions, cores, or disrupted planetesimals. It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio survey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs. The study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means to detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf coronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf magnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of planetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double degenerate merger events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal loops generally trace magnetic lines of force in the upper solar atmosphere. Understanding the loop morphology and its temporal evolution has implications for coronal heating models that rely on plasma heating due to reconnection at current sheets. Simultaneous observations of coronal loops from multiple vantage points are best suited for this purpose. Here, we report a stereoscopic analysis of coronal loops in an active region based on observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter Spacecraft and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our stereoscopic analysis reveals that coronal loops have nearly circular cross-sectional widths and that they exhibit temporally coherent intensity variations along their lengths on timescales of around 30\,minutes. Results suggest that coronal loops can be best represented as three-dimensional monolithic or coherent plasma bundles that outline magnetic field lines. Therefore, at least on the scales resolved by Solar Orbiter, it is unlikely that coronal loops are manifestations of emission from the randomly aligned wrinkles in two-dimensional plasma sheets along the line-of-sight as proposed in the `coronal veil' hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a novel optimal theoretical framework based on potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics which provides a smooth extrapolation of Parker's steady solar wind model to the unsteady case. The viability of this framework is illustrated by providing the first ever systematic theoretical formulation to successfully address the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point (where the solar wind flow velocity equals the speed of sound in the gas) in the linear stability problem of Parker's steady solar wind solution. This development involves going outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporating the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system, and hence provides an appropriate nonlinear recipe to regularize this singularity. The stability of Parker's steady wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by analyzing the concomitant nonlinear problem. The new theoretical framework given here seems, therefore, to have the potential to provide a viable basis for future formulations addressing various theoretical aspects of Parker's unsteady solar wind model.</description>
