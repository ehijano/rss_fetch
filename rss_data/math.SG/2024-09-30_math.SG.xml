      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu-Poisson brackets, I. New identities for Jacobian determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nambu-determinant brackets on $R^d\ni x=(x^1,...,x^d)$, $\{f,g\}_d(x)=\rho(x) \det(\partial(f,g,a_1,...,a_{d-2})/\partial(x^1,...,x^d))$, with $a_i\in C^\infty(R^d)$ and $\rho\partial_x\in\mathfrak{X}^d(R^d)$, are a class of Poisson structures with (non)linear coefficients, e.g., polynomials of arbitrarily high degree. With good cocycles in the graph complex, Kontsevich associated universal -- for all Poisson bivectors $P$ on affine $R^d_{aff}$ -- elements $\dot{P}=Q^\gamma(P)\in H^2_{P}(R^d_{aff})$ in the Lichnerowicz-Poisson second cohomology groups; we note that known graph cocycles $\gamma$ preserve the Nambu-Poisson class $\{P(\rho,a)\}$, and we express, directly from $\gamma$, the evolution $\dot{\rho}$,$\dot{a}$ that induces $\dot{P}$.
  Over all $d\geq2$ at once, there is no universal mechanism for the bivector cocycles $Q^\gamma_d$ to be trivial, $Q^\gamma_d=[\![P,\vec{X}^\gamma_d(P)]\!]$, w.r.t. vector fields defined uniformly for all dimensions $d$ by the same graph formula. While over $R^2$, the graph flows $\dot{P} = Q^{\gamma_i}_{2D}(P(\rho))$ for $\gamma\in\{\gamma_3,\gamma_5,\gamma_7,...\}$ are trivialized by vector fields $\vec{X}^{\gamma_i}_{2D}=(dx\wedge dy)^{-1}d_{dR}(Ham^{\gamma_i}(P))$ of peculiar shape, we detect that in $d\geq3$, the 1-vectors from 2D, now with $P(\rho,a_1,...,a_{d-2})$ inside, do not solve the problems $Q^{\gamma_i}_{d\geq3}=[\![P,{\vec{X}^{\gamma_i}_{d\geq3}}(P(\rho,a))]\!]$, yet they do yield good Ansatz where we find solutions $\vec{X}^{\gamma_i}_{d=3,4}(P(\rho,a))$. In the study of the step $d\mapsto d+1$, by adapting the Kontsevich graph calculus to the Nambu-Poisson class of brackets, we discover more identities for the Jacobian determinants within $P(\rho,a)$, i.e. for multivector-valued $GL(d)$-invariants on $R^d_{aff}$.</description>

      <title>A survey of equivariant operations on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey paper, we will collate various different ideas and thoughts regarding equivariant operations on quantum cohomology (and some in more general Floer theory) for a symplectic manifold. We will discuss a general notion of equivariant quantum operations associated to finite groups, in addition to their properties, examples, and calculations. We will provide a brief connection to Floer theoretic invariants. We then provide abridged descriptions (as per the author's understanding) of work by other authors in the field, along with their major results. Finally we discuss the first step to compact groups, specifically $S^1$-equivariant operations. Contained within this survey are also a sketch of the idea of mod-$p$ pseudocycles, and an in-depth appendix detailing the author's understanding of when one can define these equivariant operations in an additive way.</description>

      <title>The number of periodic points of surface symplectic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use symplectic tools to establish a smooth variant of Franks theorem for a closed orientable surface of positive genus $g$; it implies that a symplectic diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity with more than $2g-2$ fixed points, counted homologically, has infinitely many periodic points. Furthermore, we present examples of symplectic diffeomorphisms with a prescribed number of periodic points. In particular, we construct symplectic flows on surfaces possessing only one fixed point and no other periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Modified double brackets and a conjecture of S. Arthamonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Around 20 years ago, M. Van den Bergh introduced double Poisson brackets as operations on associative algebras inducing Poisson brackets under the representation functor. Weaker versions of these operations, called modified double Poisson brackets, were later introduced by S. Arthamonov in order to induce a Poisson bracket on moduli spaces of representations of the corresponding associative algebras. Moreover, he defined two operations that he conjectured to be modified double Poisson brackets. The first case of this conjecture was recently proved by M. Goncharov and V. Gubarev motivated by the theory of Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight. We settle the conjecture by realising the second case as part of a new family of modified double Poisson brackets. These are obtained from mixed double Poisson algebras, a new class of algebraic structures that are introduced and studied in the present work.</description>
