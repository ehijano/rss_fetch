      <title>Deep polytopic autoencoders for low-dimensional linear parameter-varying approximations and nonlinear feedback design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-dimensional parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it outperforms standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems and how the particular architecture enables higher order series expansions at little extra computational effort. We illustrate the properties and potentials of this approach to computational nonlinear controller design for large-scale systems with a thorough numerical study.</description>

      <title>The Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Drops: A Simple and Effective Heuristic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Drops (FSTSP-MD), a multi-modal last-mile delivery model where a single truck and a single drone cooperatively deliver customer packages. In the FSTSP-MD, the drone can be launched from the truck to deliver multiple packages before it returns to the truck for a new delivery operation. The FSTSP-MD aims to find the synchronized truck and drone delivery routes that minimize the completion time of the delivery process. We develop a simple and effective heuristic approach based on an order-first, split-second scheme. This heuristic combines standard local search and diversification techniques with a novel shortest-path problem that finds FSTSP-MD solutions in polynomial time. We show that our heuristic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristics developed for the FSTSP-MD and the FSTSP (i.e., the single-drop case) through extensive numerical experiments. We also show that the FSTSP-MD substantially reduces completion times compared to a traditional truck-only delivery system. Several managerial insights are described regarding the effects of drone capacity, drone speed, drone flight endurance, and customer distribution.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Finite Volume Method for Uncertainty Management in Gas Pipeline Network Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural gas consumption by users of pipeline networks is subject to increasing uncertainty that originates from the intermittent nature of electric power loads serviced by gas-fired generators. To enable computationally efficient optimization of gas network flows subject to uncertainty, we develop a finite volume representation of stochastic solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems on graph-connected domains with nodal coupling and boundary conditions. The representation is used to express the physical constraints in stochastic optimization problems for gas flow allocation subject to uncertain parameters. The method is based on the stochastic finite volume approach that was recently developed for uncertainty quantification in transient flows represented by hyperbolic PDEs on graphs. In this study, we develop optimization formulations for steady-state gas flow over actuated transport networks subject to probabilistic constraints. In addition to the distributions for the physical solutions, we examine the dual variables that are produced by way of the optimization, and interpret them as price distributions that quantify the financial volatility that arises through demand uncertainty modeled in an optimization-driven gas market mechanism. We demonstrate the computation and distributional analysis using a single-pipe example and a small test network.</description>

      <title>Generalized Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sampling-based trajectory optimization method derived from the maximum entropy formulation of Differential Dynamic Programming with Tsallis entropy. This method can be seen as a generalization of the legacy work with Shannon entropy, which leads to a Gaussian optimal control policy for exploration during optimization. With the Tsallis entropy, the optimal control policy takes the form of $q$-Gaussian, which further encourages exploration with its heavy-tailed shape. Moreover, in our formulation, the exploration variance, which was scaled by a fixed constant inverse temperature in the original formulation with Shannon entropy, is automatically scaled based on the value function of the trajectory. Due to this property, our algorithms can promote exploration when necessary, that is, the cost of the trajectory is high, rather than using the same scaling factor. The simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed algorithm described above.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Iterative Quadratic Programming for Robust Fixed-Endpoint Transfer of Bilinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational method for open-loop minimum-norm control synthesis for fixed-endpoint transfer of bilinear ensemble systems that are indexed by two continuously varying parameters. We suppose that one ensemble parameter scales the homogeneous, linear part of the dynamics, and the second parameter scales the effect of the applied control inputs on the inhomogeneous, bilinear dynamics. This class of dynamical systems is motivated by robust quantum control pulse synthesis, where the ensemble parameters correspond to uncertainty in the free Hamiltonian and inhomogeneity in the control Hamiltonian, respectively. Our computational method is based on polynomial approximation of the ensemble state in parameter space and discretization of the evolution equations in the time domain using a product of matrix exponentials corresponding to zero-order hold controls over the time intervals. The dynamics are successively linearized about control and trajectory iterates to formulate a sequence of quadratic programs for computing perturbations to the control that successively improve the objective until the iteration converges. We use a two-stage computation to first ensure transfer to the desired terminal state, and then minimize the norm of the control function. The method is demonstrated for the canonical uniform transfer problem for the Bloch system that appears in nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as the matter-wave splitting problem for the Raman-Nath system that appears in ultra-cold atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>An inexact infeasible arc-search interior-point method for linear programming problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inexact interior-point methods (IPMs) are a type of interior-point methods that inexactly solve the linear equation system for obtaining the search direction. On the other hand,arc-search IPMs approximate the central path with an ellipsoidal arc obtained by solving two linear equation systems in each iteration, while conventional line-search IPMs solve one linear system, therefore, the improvement due to the inexact solutions of the linear equation systems can be more beneficial in arc-search IPMs than conventional IPMs. In this paper, we propose an inexact infeasible arc-search interior-point method.We establish that the proposed method is a polynomial-time algorithm through its convergence analysis. The numerical experiments with the conjugate gradient method show that the proposed method can reduce the number of iterations compared to an existing method for benchmark problems; the numbers of iterations are reduced to two-thirds for more than 70% of the problems.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mine Planning with Large Neighbourhood Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Large Neighbourhood Search based approach for solving complex long-term open-pit mine planning problems. An initial feasible solution, generated by a sliding windows heuristic, is improved through repeated solves of a restricted mixed integer program. Each iteration leaves only a subset of the variables in our planning model free to take on new values. We form these subsets through the use of a novel path-based neighbourhood structure, and neighbourhood formation strategies that exploit the structure of the planning model. We show that our method is able to find near-optimal solutions to problems that cannot be solved by an off-the-shelf solver in a reasonable time, or with reasonable computational resources.</description>

      <title>A new dual spectral projected gradient method for log-determinant semidefinite programming with hidden clustering structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new efficient method for a sparse Gaussian graphical model with hidden clustering structures by extending a dual spectral projected gradient (DSPG) method proposed by Nakagaki et al.~(2020). We establish the global convergence of the proposed method to an optimal solution, and we show that the projection onto the feasible region can be solved with a low computational complexity by the use of the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthesis data and real data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed method takes 0.91 seconds to achieve a similar solution to the direct application of the DSPG method which takes 4361 seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mean field game for a family of filtering problems related to the classic sequential testing of the drift of a Brownian motion. To the best of our knowledge this work presents the first treatment of mean field filtering games with stopping and an unobserved common noise in the literature. We show that the game is well-posed, characterize the solution, and establish the existence of an equilibrium under certain assumptions. We also perform numerical studies for several examples of interest.</description>

      <title>Online Prediction for Streaming Tensor Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time prediction plays a vital role in various control systems, such as traffic congestion control and wireless channel resource allocation. In these scenarios, the predictor usually needs to track the evolution of the latent statistical patterns in the modern high-dimensional streaming time series continuously and quickly, which presents new challenges for traditional prediction methods. This paper proposes a novel algorithm based on tensor factorization to predict streaming tensor time series online. The proposed algorithm updates the predictor in a low-complexity online manner to adapt to the time-evolving data. Additionally, an automatically adaptive version of the algorithm is presented to mitigate the negative impact of stale data. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve prediction accuracy similar to that of conventional offline tensor prediction methods, while being much faster than them during long-term online prediction. Therefore, our proposed algorithm provides an effective and efficient solution for the online prediction of streaming tensor time series.</description>

      <title>Computing safe bicycle routes -- Berechnung sicherer Fahrradwege</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety of streets is difficult to quantify numerically. However, it is possible to sort streets regarding their safety into ordered categories, like safe, neutral and unsafe. In this paper we model the computation of safe bicycle routes as an optimization problem with ordinal coefficients. We describe an appropriate optimality concept for ordinal optimization problems and introduce a solution strategy for ordinal routing problems. Furthermore, we introduce a concept to incorporate safety preferences by introducing weights such that longer path with a higher safety rating are preferred. We apply the concept of ordinal routing to compute safe bicycle routes in Stuttgart, Germany, based on dates from OpenStreetMaps. We show that the choice of the weights does not only represent the trade-off of safety vs. path length, but has also an impact on the number of alternative solutions and thus on the computation time.

  Die Sicherheit von Wegen ist nur eingeschr\"ankt messbar und daher schwierig zu quantifizieren. Dahingegen ist es verh\"altnism\"a{\ss}ig leicht Wege bez\"uglich ihrer Sicherheit in geordnete Kategorien, wie beispielsweise sicher, neutral und gef\"ahrlich einzuordnen. In diesem Beitrag werden Optimierungsprobleme mit geordneten Kategorien formuliert und Optimalit\"at f\"ur diese definiert. Daraus wird eine L\"osungsstrategie f\"ur solche Probleme abgeleitet. Dar\"uber hinaus wird erkl\"art, wie die Abgrenzung zwischen den Kategorien erh\"oht werden kann, sodass l\"angere aber daf\"ur sicherere Wege mit Hilfe von Gewichten berechnet werden k\"onnen. Diese theoretischen Ergebnisse werden in der Praxis angewendet und es werden auf Grundlage von Daten von OpenStreetMaps sichere Fahrradwege in Stuttgart berechnet. Dabei zeigt sich, dass eine gute Wahl der Gewichte zu weniger L\"osungen und k\"urzeren Rechenzeiten f\"uhrt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback optimization is an increasingly popular control paradigm to optimize dynamical systems, accounting for control objectives that concern the system's operation at steady-state. Existing feedback optimization techniques heavily rely on centralized system and controller architectures, and thus suffer from scalability and privacy issues when systems become large-scale. In this paper, we propose and study a distributed architecture for feedback optimization, in which each agent updates its local control state by combining the average of its neighbors with a local negative-gradient step. Under convexity and smoothness assumptions, we establish convergence of the control method to a fixed point. By reinforcing the assumptions to restricted strong convexity of the cost, we show that our algorithm converges linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal point, where the size of the neighborhood depends on the choice of the stepsize. Simulations corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Quasi Norm Regularized Low-Rank Factorization for Matrix Robust PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and its associated non-convex relaxation methods constitute a significant component of matrix completion problems, wherein matrix factorization strategies effectively reduce dimensionality and enhance computational speed. However, some non-convex factorization forms lack theoretical guarantees. This paper proposes a novel strategy in non-convex quasi-norm representation, introducing a method to obtain weighted matrix quasi-norm factorization forms. Especially, explicit bilinear factor matrix factorization formulations for the weighted logarithmic norm and weighted Schatten-$q$ quasi norms with $q=1, 1/2, 2/3$ are provided, along with the establishment of corresponding matrix completion models. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework algorithm is employed for solving, and convergence results of the algorithm are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by relativistic materials, we develop a numerical scheme to support existing or state new conjectures in the spectral optimisation of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator, subject to infinite-mass boundary conditions. We study the optimality of the regular polygon (respectively, disk) among all polygons of a given number of sides (respectively, arbitrary sets), subject to area or perimeter constraints. We consider the three lowest positive eigenvalues and their ratios. Roughly, we find results analogous to known or expected for the Dirichlet Laplacian, except for the third eigenvalue which does not need to be minimised by the regular polygon (respectively, the disk) for all masses. In addition to the numerical results, a new, mass-dependent upper bound to the lowest eigenvalue in rectangles is proved and its extension to arbitrary quadrilaterals is conjectured.</description>

      <title>Stability Properties of the Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator in 1-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator (IGO) is a mathematical model of a hybrid closed-loop system. It arises by closing a special kind of continuous linear positive time-invariant system with impulsive feedback, which employs both amplitude and frequency pulse modulation. The structure of IGO precludes the existence of equilibria, and all its solutions are oscillatory. With its origin in mathematical biology, the IGO also presents a control paradigm useful in a wide range of applications, in particular dosing of chemicals and medicines. Since the pulse modulation feedback mechanism introduces significant nonlinearity and non-smoothness in the closedloop dynamics, conventional controller design methods fail to apply. However, the hybrid dynamics of IGO reduce to a nonlinear, time-invariant discrete-time system, exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence between periodic solutions of the original IGO and those of the discrete-time system. The paper proposes a design approach that leverages the linearization of the equivalent discrete-time dynamics in the vicinity of a fixed point. A simple and efficient local stability condition of the 1-cycle in terms of the characteristics of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions is obtained.</description>

      <title>Accelerating preconditioned ADMM via degenerate proximal point mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to accelerate a preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers (pADMM), whose proximal terms are convex quadratic functions, for solving linearly constrained convex optimization problems. To achieve this, we first reformulate the pADMM into a form of proximal point method (PPM) with a positive semidefinite preconditioner which can be degenerate due to the lack of strong convexity of the proximal terms in the pADMM. Then we accelerate the pADMM by accelerating the reformulated degenerate PPM (dPPM). Specifically, we first propose an accelerated dPPM by integrating the Halpern iteration and the fast Krasnosel'ski\u{i}-Mann iteration into it, achieving asymptotic $o(1/k)$ and non-asymptotic $O(1/k)$ convergence rates. Subsequently, building upon the accelerated dPPM, we develop an accelerated pADMM algorithm that exhibits both asymptotic $o(1/k)$ and non-asymptotic $O(1/k)$ nonergodic convergence rates concerning the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker residual and the primal objective function value gap. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating that the accelerated pADMM outperforms the pADMM in solving convex quadratic programming problems.</description>

      <title>Connections between Reachability and Time Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept of an equivalence relation between the set of optimal control problems. By leveraging this concept, we show that the boundary of the reachability set can be constructed by the solutions of time optimal problems. Alongside, a more generalized equivalence theorem is presented together. The findings facilitate the use of solution structures from a certain class of optimal control problems to address problems in corresponding equivalent classes. As a byproduct, we state and prove the construction methods of the reachability sets of three-dimensional curves with prescribed curvature bound. The findings are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any boundary point of the reachability set, with the terminal direction taken into account, can be accessed via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a straight segment. Secondly, we show that any boundary point of the reachability set, without considering the terminal direction, can be accessed by curves of CC, CS, or their respective subsegments. These findings extend the developments presented in literature regarding planar curves, or Dubins car dynamics, into spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For higher dimensions, we confirm that the problem of identifying the reachability set of curvature bounded paths subsumes the well-known Markov-Dubins problem. These advancements in understanding the reachability of curvature bounded paths in $\mathbb{R}^3$ hold significant practical implications, particularly in the contexts of mission planning problems and time optimal guidance.</description>

      <title>A nonsmooth Frank-Wolfe algorithm through a dual cutting-plane approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension of the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm (FWA), also known as Conditional Gradient algorithm, is proposed. In its standard form, the FWA allows to solve constrained optimization problems involving $\beta$-smooth cost functions, calling at each iteration a Linear Minimization Oracle. More specifically, the oracle solves a problem obtained by linearization of the original cost function. The algorithm designed and investigated in this article, named Dualized Level-Set (DLS) algorithm, extends the FWA and allows to address a class of nonsmooth costs, involving in particular support functions. The key idea behind the construction of the DLS method is a general interpretation of the FWA as a cutting-plane algorithm, from the dual point of view. The DLS algorithm essentially results from a dualization of a specific cutting-plane algorithm, based on projections on some level sets. The DLS algorithm generates a sequence of primal-dual candidates, and we prove that the corresponding primal-dual gap converges with a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{t})$.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. This problem, which has a long history, has found applications in science and technology. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. To the best of our knowledge these fundamental issues have not received much attention. In particular, we present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP relative to these subsets. These conditions are related to the structure of the boundaries of the subsets, their relative orientation, and the structure of the unit sphere of the space. In addition, we present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP, possibly without convexity . Our results allow us to significantly extend the horizon of the recent alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke (A-S-HLWB) algorithm [Censor, Mansour and Reem, The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets, arXiv:2304.09600 (2023)] for solving the BAP problem.</description>

      <title>A better compression driver? CutFEM 3D shape optimization taking viscothermal losses into account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compression driver, the standard sound source for midrange acoustic horns, contains a cylindrical compression chamber connected to the horn throat through a system of channels known as a phase plug. The main challenge in the design of the phase plug is to avoid resonance and interference phenomena. The complexity of these phenomena makes it difficult to carry out this design task manually, particularly when the phase-plug channels are radially oriented. Therefore, we employ an algorithmic technique that combines numerical solutions of the governing equations with a gradient-based optimization algorithm that can deform the walls of the phase plug. A particular modeling challenge here is that viscothermal losses cannot be ignored, due to narrow chambers and slits in the device. Fortunately, a recently developed, accurate, but computationally inexpensive boundary-layer model is applicable. We use this model, a level-set geometry description, and the Cut Finite Element technique to avoid mesh changes when the geometry is modified by the optimization algorithm. Moreover, the shape calculus needed to compute derivatives for the optimization algorithm is carried out in the fully discrete case. Applying these techniques, the algorithm was able to successfully design the shape of a set of radially-directed phase plugs so that the final frequency response surprisingly closely matches the ideal response, derived by a lumped circuit model where wave interference effects are not accounted for. This result may serve to resuscitate the radial phase plug design, rarely used in today's commercial compression drivers.</description>

      <title>Code Generation for Conic Model-Predictive Control on Microcontrollers with TinyMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conic constraints appear in many important control applications like legged locomotion, robotic manipulation, and autonomous rocket landing. However, current solvers for conic optimization problems have relatively heavy computational demands in terms of both floating-point operations and memory footprint, making them impractical for use on small embedded devices. We extend TinyMPC, an open-source, high-speed solver targeting low-power embedded control applications, to handle second-order cone constraints. We also present code-generation software to enable deployment of TinyMPC on a variety of microcontrollers. We benchmark our generated code against state-of-the-art embedded QP and SOCP solvers, demonstrating a two-order-of-magnitude speed increase over ECOS while consuming less memory. Finally, we demonstrate TinyMPC's efficacy on the Crazyflie, a lightweight, resource-constrained quadrotor with fast dynamics. TinyMPC and its code-generation tools are publicly available at https://tinympc.org.</description>

      <title>Incentive Designs for Learning Agents to Stabilize Coupled Exogenous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a large population of learning agents noncooperatively selecting strategies from a common set, influencing the dynamics of an exogenous system (ES) we seek to stabilize at a desired equilibrium. Our approach is to design a dynamic payoff mechanism capable of shaping the population's strategy profile, thus affecting the ES's state, by offering incentives for specific strategies within budget limits. Employing system-theoretic passivity concepts, we establish conditions under which a payoff mechanism can be systematically constructed to ensure the global asymptotic stabilization of the ES's equilibrium. In comparison to previous approaches originally studied in the context of the so-called epidemic population games, the method proposed here allows for more realistic epidemic models and other types of ES, such as predator-prey dynamics. Stabilization is established with the support of a Lyapunov function, which provides useful bounds on the transients.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>Mistake, Manipulation and Margin Guarantees in Online Strategic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an online strategic classification problem where each arriving agent can manipulate their true feature vector to obtain a positive predicted label, while incurring a cost that depends on the amount of manipulation. The learner seeks to predict the agent's true label given access to only the manipulated features. After the learner releases their prediction, the agent's true label is revealed. Previous algorithms such as the strategic perceptron guarantee finitely many mistakes under a margin assumption on agents' true feature vectors. However, these are not guaranteed to encourage agents to be truthful. Promoting truthfulness is intimately linked to obtaining adequate margin on the predictions, thus we provide two new algorithms aimed at recovering the maximum margin classifier in the presence of strategic agent behavior. We prove convergence, finite mistake and finite manipulation guarantees for a variety of agent cost structures. We also provide generalized versions of the strategic perceptron with mistake guarantees for different costs. Our numerical study on real and synthetic data demonstrates that the new algorithms outperform previous ones in terms of margin, number of manipulation and number of mistakes.</description>

      <title>Topology Optimization for the Full-Cell Design of Porous Electrodes in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a density-based topology optimization framework to design porous electrodes for maximum energy storage. We simulate the full cell with a model that incorporates electronic potential, ionic potential, and electrolyte concentration. The system consists of three materials, namely pure liquid electrolyte and the porous solids of the anode and cathode, for which we determine the optimal placement. We use separate electronic potentials to model each electrode, which allow interdigitated designs. As the result, a penalization is required to ensure that the anode and cathode do not touch, i.e. causing a short circuit. We compare multiple 2D designs generated for different fixed conditions, e.g. material properties. A 3D design with complex channel and interlocking structure is also created. All optimized designs are far superior to the traditional monolithic electrode design with respect to energy storage metrics. We observe up to 750% increase in energy storage for cases with slow effective ionic diffusion within the porous electrode.</description>

      <title>An Execution-time-certified QP Algorithm for $\ell_1$ penalty-based Soft-constrained MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing an execution time certificate and handling possible infeasibility in closed-loop are two pressing requirements of Model Predictive Control (MPC). To simultaneously meet these two requirements, this paper uses $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation and innovatively transforms the resulting non-smooth QP into a box-constrained QP, which is solved by our previously proposed direct and execution-time certified algorithm with only dimension-dependent (data-independent) and exact number of iterations [1]. This approach not only overcomes the limitation of our previously proposed algorithm [1], only applicable to input-constrained MPC, but also enjoys exact recovery feature (exactly recover the same solution when the original problem is feasible) of $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation without suffering numerical difficulty of the resulting non-smoothness. Other various real-time QP applications, not limited to MPC, will also benefit from our QP algorithm with execution-time certificate and global feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetostatic field distribution in a nonlinear medium amounts to the unique minimizer of the magnetic coenergy over all fields that can be generated by the same current. This is a nonlinear saddlepoint problem whose numerical solution can in principle be achieved by mixed finite element methods and appropriate nonlinear solvers. The saddlepoint structure, however, makes the solution cumbersome. A remedy is to split the magnetic field into a known source field and the gradient of a scalar potential which is governed by a convex minimization problem. The penalty approach avoids the use of artificial potentials and Lagrange multipliers and leads to an unconstrained convex minimization problem involving a large parameter. We provide a rigorous justification of the penalty approach by deriving error estimates for the approximation due to penalization. We further highlight the close connections to the Lagrange-multiplier and scalar potential approach. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical tests for a typical benchmark problem</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Regularized Nonnegative Scale-invariant Low-rank Approximation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations such as sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization or sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition are an important branch of dimensionality reduction models with enhanced interpretability. However, from a practical perspective, the choice of regularizers and regularization coefficients, as well as the design of efficient algorithms, is challenging because of the multifactor nature of these models and the lack of theory to back these choices. This paper aims at improving upon these issues. By studying a more general model called the Homogeneous Regularized Scale-Invariant, we prove that the scale-invariance inherent to low-rank approximation models causes an implicit regularization with both unexpected beneficial and detrimental effects. This observation allows to better understand the effect of regularization functions in low-rank approximation models, to guide the choice of the regularization hyperparameters, and to design balancing strategies to enhance the convergence speed of dedicated optimization algorithms. Some of these results were already known but restricted to specific instances of regularized low-rank approximations. We also derive a generic Majorization Minimization algorithm that handles many regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations, with convergence guarantees. We showcase our contributions on sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, ridge-regularized Canonical Polyadic decomposition and sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of phase retrieval has many applications in the field of optical imaging. Motivated by imaging experiments with biological specimens, we primarily consider the setting of low-dose illumination where Poisson noise plays the dominant role. In this paper, we discuss gradient descent algorithms based on different loss functions adapted to data affected by Poisson noise, in particular in the low-dose regime. Starting from the maximum log-likelihood function for the Poisson distribution, we investigate different regularizations and approximations of the problem to design an algorithm that meets the requirements that are faced in applications. In the course of this, we focus on low-count measurements. For all suggested loss functions, we study the convergence of the respective gradient descent algorithms to stationary points and find constant step sizes that guarantee descent of the loss in each iteration. Numerical experiments in the low-dose regime are performed to corroborate the theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized convergence of the deep BSDE method: a step towards fully-coupled FBSDEs and applications in stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with high-dimensional coupled FBSDE systems approximated by the deep BSDE method of Han et al. (2018). It was shown by Han and Long (2020) that the errors induced by the deep BSDE method admit a posteriori estimate depending on the loss function, whenever the backward equation only couples into the forward diffusion through the Y process. We generalize this result to fully-coupled drift coefficients, and give sufficient conditions for convergence under standard assumptions. The resulting conditions are directly verifiable for any equation. Consequently, unlike in earlier theory, our convergence analysis enables the treatment of FBSDEs stemming from stochastic optimal control problems. In particular, we provide a theoretical justification for the non-convergence of the deep BSDE method observed in recent literature, and present direct guidelines for when convergence can be guaranteed in practice. Our theoretical findings are supported by several numerical experiments in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encrypted dynamic controllers that operate for an unlimited time have been a challenging subject of research. The fundamental difficulty is the accumulation of errors and scaling factors in the internal state during operation. Bootstrapping, a technique commonly employed in fully homomorphic cryptosystems, can be used to avoid overflows in the controller state but can potentially introduce significant numerical errors. In this paper, we analyze dynamic encrypted control with explicit consideration of bootstrapping. By recognizing the bootstrapping errors occurring in the controller's state as an uncertainty in the robust control framework, we can provide stability and performance guarantees for the whole encrypted control system. Further, the conservatism of the stability and performance test is reduced by using a lifted version of the control system.</description>

      <title>Conditional Wasserstein Distances with Applications in Bayesian OT Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inverse problems, many conditional generative models approximate the posterior measure by minimizing a distance between the joint measure and its learned approximation. While this approach also controls the distance between the posterior measures in the case of the Kullback--Leibler divergence, this is in general not hold true for the Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we introduce a conditional Wasserstein distance via a set of restricted couplings that equals the expected Wasserstein distance of the posteriors. Interestingly, the dual formulation of the conditional Wasserstein-1 flow resembles losses in the conditional Wasserstein GAN literature in a quite natural way. We derive theoretical properties of the conditional Wasserstein distance, characterize the corresponding geodesics and velocity fields as well as the flow ODEs. Subsequently, we propose to approximate the velocity fields by relaxing the conditional Wasserstein distance. Based on this, we propose an extension of OT Flow Matching for solving Bayesian inverse problems and demonstrate its numerical advantages on an inverse problem and class-conditional image generation.</description>

      <title>Follower Agnostic Methods for Stackelberg Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to solve online Stackelberg games, featuring multiple followers, in a follower-agnostic manner. Unlike previous works, our approach works even when leader has no knowledge about the followers' utility functions or strategy space. Our algorithm introduces a unique gradient estimator, leveraging specially designed strategies to probe followers. In a departure from traditional assumptions of optimal play, we model followers' responses using a convergent adaptation rule, allowing for realistic and dynamic interactions. The leader constructs the gradient estimator solely based on observations of followers' actions. We provide both non-asymptotic convergence rates to stationary points of the leader's objective and demonstrate asymptotic convergence to a \emph{local Stackelberg equilibrium}. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we use this algorithm to solve the problem of incentive design on a large-scale transportation network, showcasing its robustness even when the leader lacks access to followers' demand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new gradient-like dynamical system related to unconstrained convex smooth multiobjective optimization which involves inertial effects and asymptotic vanishing damping. To the best of our knowledge, this system is the first inertial gradient-like system for multiobjective optimization problems including asymptotic vanishing damping, expanding the ideas laid out in [H. Attouch and G. Garrigos, Multiobjective optimization: an inertial approach to Pareto optima, preprint, arXiv:1506.02823, 201]. We prove existence of solutions to this system in finite dimensions and further prove that its bounded solutions converge weakly to weakly Pareto optimal points. In addition, we obtain a convergence rate of order $O(t^{-2})$ for the function values measured with a merit function. This approach presents a good basis for the development of fast gradient methods for multiobjective optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the class of trilevel equilibrium problems with a focus on energy-environmental applications and present a novel single-level reformulation for such problems, based on strong duality. To the best of our knowledge, only one alternative single-level reformulation for trilevel problems exists. This reformulation uses a representation of the bottom-level solution set, whereas we propose a reformulation based on strong duality. Our novel reformulation is compared to this existing formulation, discussing both model sizes and computational performance. In particular, we apply this trilevel framework to a power market model, exploring the possibilities of an international policymaker in reducing emissions of the system. Using the proposed methods, we are able to obtain globally optimal solutions for a five-node case study representing the Nordic countries and assess the impact of a carbon tax on the electricity production portfolio.</description>

      <title>On model predictive control with sampled-data input for output tracking with prescribed performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model predictive control (MPC) scheme with sampled-data input which ensures output-reference tracking within prescribed error bounds for relative-degree-one systems. Hereby, we explicitly deduce bounds on the required maximal control input and sampling frequency such that the MPC scheme is both initially and recursively feasible. A key feature of the proposed approach is that neither terminal conditions nor a sufficiently-large prediction horizon are imposed, rendering the MPC scheme computationally efficient. We illustrate the MPC algorithm via a numerical example of a torsional oscillator.</description>

      <title>Tikhonov Regularization for Stochastic Non-Smooth Convex Optimization in Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve non-smooth convex optimization problems with a noisy gradient input, we analyze the global behavior of subgradient-like flows under stochastic errors. The objective function is composite, being equal to the sum of two convex functions, one being differentiable and the other potentially non-smooth. We then use stochastic differential inclusions where the drift term is minus the subgradient of the objective function, and the diffusion term is either bounded or square-integrable. In this context, under Lipschitz's continuity of the differentiable term and a growth condition of the non-smooth term, our first main result shows almost sure weak convergence of the trajectory process towards a minimizer of the objective function. Then, using Tikhonov regularization with a properly tuned vanishing parameter, we can obtain almost sure strong convergence of the trajectory towards the minimum norm solution. We find an explicit tuning of this parameter when our objective function satisfies a local error-bound inequality. We also provide a comprehensive complexity analysis by establishing several new pointwise and ergodic convergence rates in expectation for the convex and strongly convex case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of infinite horizon fully coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We propose a generalized monotonicity condition involving two flexible functions. Under this condition, we establish the well-posedness results for infinite horizon McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs by the method of continuation, including the unique solvability, an estimate of the solution, and the related continuous dependence property of the solution on the coefficients. Based on the solvability result, we study an infinite horizon mean field control problem. Moreover, by choosing appropriate form of the flexible functions, we can eliminate the different phenomenon between the linear-quadratic (LQ) problems on infinite horizon and finite horizon proposed in Wei and Yu (SIAM J. Control Optim. 59: 2594-2623, 2021).</description>

Abstract: The shift design and the personnel scheduling problem is known to be a difficult problem. It is a real-world problem which has lots of applications in the organization of companies. Solutions are usually found by dividing the problem in two steps: first the shifts are created, then the employees are assigned to them by respecting a bunch of constraints. The assignment of different tasks increases the complexity, since we have to consider the skills of the single employee necessary to perform any activity. In this paper we present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation which models together the shift creation and the construction of rosters for employees, with the objective of minimizing the amount of uncovered demand. Finally we provide the results for three real-world instances, confirming that this approach is promising.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Control Allocation: A Learning Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern aircraft are designed with redundant control effectors to cater for fault tolerance and maneuverability requirements. This leads to aircraft being over-actuated and requires control allocation schemes to distribute the control commands among control effectors. Traditionally, optimization-based control allocation schemes are used; however, for nonlinear allocation problems, these methods require large computational resources. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) based nonlinear control allocation scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme is composed of learning the inverse of the control effectiveness map through ANN, and then implementing it as an allocator instead of solving an online optimization problem. Stability conditions are presented for closed-loop systems incorporating the allocator, and computational challenges are explored with piece-wise linear effectiveness functions and ANN-based allocators. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme, it is compared with a standard quadratic programming-based method for control allocation.</description>

      <title>Parabolic PDE-constrained optimal control under uncertainty with entropic risk measure using quasi-Monte Carlo integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the application of a tailored quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of optimal control problems subject to parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) constraints under uncertainty: the state in our setting is the solution of a parabolic PDE with a random thermal diffusion coefficient, steered by a control function. To account for the presence of uncertainty in the optimal control problem, the objective function is composed with a risk measure. We focus on two risk measures, both involving high-dimensional integrals over the stochastic variables: the expected value and the (nonlinear) entropic risk measure. The high-dimensional integrals are computed numerically using specially designed QMC methods and, under moderate assumptions on the input random field, the error rate is shown to be essentially linear, independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem -- and thereby superior to ordinary Monte Carlo methods. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airplane refueling problem is a nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem with $n!$ feasible solutions. Given a fleet of $n$ airplanes with mid-air refueling technique, the question is to find the best refueling policy to make the last remaining airplane travels the farthest. In order to deal with the large scale of airplanes refueling instances, we proposed the definition of sequential feasible solution by employing the refueling properties of data structure. We proved that if an airplanes refueling instance has feasible solutions, it must have the sequential feasible solutions; and the optimal feasible solution must be the optimal sequential feasible solution. Then we proposed the sequential search algorithm which consists of two steps. The first step of the sequential search algorithm aims to seek out all of the sequential feasible solutions. When the input size of $n$ is greater than an index number, we proved that the number of the sequential feasible solutions will change to grow at a polynomial rate. The second step of the sequential search algorithm aims to search for the maximal sequential feasible solution by bubble sorting all of the sequential feasible solutions. Moreover, we built an efficient computability scheme, according to which we could forecast within a polynomial time the computational complexity of the sequential search algorithm that runs on any given airplanes refueling instance. Thus we could provide a computational strategy for decision makers or algorithm users by considering with their available computing resources.</description>

      <title>Redesigning Large-Scale Multimodal Transit Networks with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a large-scale multimodal transit network design problem, with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services (SAMS) as both transit feeders and an origin-to-destination mode. The framework captures spatial demand and modal characteristics, considers intermodal transfers and express services, determines transit infrastructure investment and path flows, and generates transit routes. A system-optimal multimodal transit network is designed with minimum total door-to-door generalized costs of users and operators, satisfying transit origin-destination demand within a pre-set infrastructure budget. Firstly, the geography, demand, and modes in each zone are characterized with continuous approximation. The decisions of network link investment and multimodal path flows in zonal connection optimization are formulated as a minimum-cost multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) problem and solved efficiently with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver. Subsequently, the route generation problem is solved by expanding the MCNF formulation to minimize intramodal transfers. The model is illustrated through a set of experiments with the Chicago network comprised of 50 zones and seven modes, under three scenarios. The computational results present savings in traveler journey time and operator cost demonstrating the potential benefits of collaboration between multimodal transit systems and SAMS.</description>

      <title>Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaborate on building a machine learning model without sharing their private data. Although FL is considered privacy-preserved by design, recent data reconstruction attacks demonstrate that an attacker can recover clients' training data based on the parameters shared in FL. However, most existing methods fail to attack the most widely used horizontal Federated Averaging (FedAvg) scenario, where clients share model parameters after multiple local training steps. To tackle this issue, we propose an interpolation-based approximation method, which makes attacking FedAvg scenarios feasible by generating the intermediate model updates of the clients' local training processes. Then, we design a layer-wise weighted loss function to improve the data quality of reconstruction. We assign different weights to model updates in different layers concerning the neural network structure, with the weights tuned by Bayesian optimization. Finally, experimental results validate the superiority of our proposed approximate and weighted attack (AWA) method over the other state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by the substantial improvement in different evaluation metrics for image data reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Partial Dynamics Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of sample complexity of online reinforcement learning is often studied in the literature without taking into account any partial knowledge about the system dynamics that could potentially accelerate the learning process. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of online Q-learning methods when some prior knowledge about the dynamics is available or can be learned efficiently. We focus on systems that evolve according to an additive disturbance model of the form $S_{h+1} = f(S_h, A_h) + W_h$, where $f$ represents the underlying system dynamics, and $W_h$ are unknown disturbances independent of states and actions. In the setting of finite episodic Markov decision processes with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and episode length $H$, we present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\text{Poly}(H)\sqrt{T})$ regret under perfect knowledge of $f$, where $T$ is the total number of interactions with the system. This is in contrast to the typical $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\text{Poly}(H)\sqrt{SAT})$ regret for existing Q-learning methods. Further, if only a noisy estimate $\hat{f}$ of $f$ is available, our method can learn an approximately optimal policy in a number of samples that is independent of the cardinalities of state and action spaces. The sub-optimality gap depends on the approximation error $\hat{f}-f$, as well as the Lipschitz constant of the corresponding optimal value function. Our approach does not require modeling of the transition probabilities and enjoys the same memory complexity as model-free methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation with Delayed Updates: Finite-Time Rates under Markovian Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in large-scale and multi-agent reinforcement learning, we study the non-asymptotic performance of stochastic approximation (SA) schemes with delayed updates under Markovian sampling. While the effect of delays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they interact with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time performance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main contribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA update rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \emph{last iterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is \emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\tau_{max}$, and the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel inductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization analyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such, our proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the maximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time analysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular, we show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by $\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here, $\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the adaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size tuning. Our theoretical findings shed light on the finite-time effects of delays for a broad class of algorithms, including TD learning, Q-learning, and stochastic gradient descent under Markovian sampling.</description>

Abstract: Finding schedules for pairwise meetings between the members of a complex social group without creating interpersonal conflict is challenging, especially when different relationships have different needs. We formally define and study the underlying optimisation problem: Polyamorous Scheduling.
  In Polyamorous Scheduling, we are given an edge-weighted graph and try to find a periodic schedule of matchings in this graph such that the maximal weighted waiting time between consecutive occurrences of the same edge is minimised. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that there is no efficient approximation algorithm with a better ratio than 4/3 unless P = NP. On the positive side, we obtain an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm; indeed, a $O(\log \Delta)$-approximation for $\Delta$ the maximum degree, i.e., the largest number of relationships of any individual. We also define a generalisation of density from the Pinwheel Scheduling Problem, "poly density", and ask whether there exists a poly-density threshold similar to the 5/6-density threshold for Pinwheel Scheduling [Kawamura, STOC 2024]. Polyamorous Scheduling is a natural generalisation of Pinwheel Scheduling with respect to its optimisation variant, Bamboo Garden Trimming.
  Our work contributes the first nontrivial hardness-of-approximation reduction for any periodic scheduling problem, and opens up numerous avenues for further study of Polyamorous Scheduling.</description>
