      <title>The singularity category and duality for complete intersection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If G is a finite group, some aspects of the modular representation theory depend on the cochains C^*(BG; k), viewed as a commutative ring spectrum. We consider here its singularity category (in the sense of the author and Stevenson arxiv 1702.07957) and show that if C^*(BG; k) is a homotopical complete intersection in a strong sense, then the singularity category is the bounded derived category of the k-nullification of the connective ring spectrum C_*(\Omega BG_p). In the course of this we establish a form of Gorenstein duality for C_*(\Omega BG_p) for these groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use sheaf theory and the six operations to define and study the (equivariant) homology of stacks. The construction makes sense in the algebraic, complex-analytic, or even topological categories.</description>

      <title>Quivers and the Adams spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel way of identifying Adams spectral sequence $E_2$-terms in terms of homological algebra of quiver representations. Our method applies much more broadly than the standard techniques based on descent-flatness, bearing on a varied array of ring spectra. In the particular case of $p$-local integral homology, we are able to give a decomposition of the $E_2$-term, describing it completely in terms of the classical Adams spectral sequence. In the appendix, which can be read independently from the main body of the text, we develop functoriality of deformations of $\infty$-categories of the second author and Patchkoria.</description>

      <title>Topological $\Delta G$ homology of rings with twisted $G$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unifying framework for studying variants of topological Hochschild homology such as Real topological Hochschild homology. Associated to a crossed simplicial group $\Delta G$, a category that generalizes Connes' cyclic category, we introduce an invariant of rings with twisted $G$-action, which we call topological $\Delta G$-homology. Here a ring with twisted $G$-action is a common generalization of a ring with involution and a ring with $G$-action.
  Our construction provides homotopical analogues of quaternionic homology, symmetric homology, braid homology, and hyperoctahedral homology defined by Fiedorowicz--Loday. In the quaternionic case our construction, called quaternionic topological Hochschild homology, is equipped with a left Pin(2)-action and we compute it for loop spaces with a twisted $C_4$-action. As an important step along the way, we introduce a new family of crossed simplicial groups called the twisted symmetric crossed simplicial groups and we prove that they corresponds to operads for algebras with twisted $G$-action.</description>

      <title>Sparsification of the Generalized Persistence Diagrams for Scalability through Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized persistence diagram (GPD) is a natural extension of the classical persistence barcode to the setting of multi-parameter persistence and beyond. The GPD is defined as an integer-valued function whose domain is the set of intervals in the indexing poset of a persistence module, and is known to be able to capture richer topological information than its single-parameter counterpart. However, computing the GPD is computationally prohibitive due to the sheer size of the interval set. Restricting the GPD to a subset of intervals provides a way to manage this complexity, compromising discriminating power to some extent. However, identifying and computing an effective restriction of the domain that minimizes the loss of discriminating power remains an open challenge.
  In this work, we introduce a novel method for optimizing the domain of the GPD through gradient descent optimization. To achieve this, we introduce a loss function tailored to optimize the selection of intervals, balancing computational efficiency and discriminative accuracy. The design of the loss function is based on the known erosion stability property of the GPD. We showcase the efficiency of our sparsification method for dataset classification in supervised machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our sparsification method significantly reduces the time required for computing the GPDs associated to several datasets, while maintaining classification accuracies comparable to those achieved using full GPDs. Our method thus opens the way for the use of GPD-based methods to applications at an unprecedented scale.</description>

      <title>Lisse extensions of weaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any sheaf theory on schemes extends canonically to Artin stacks via a procedure called lisse extension. In this paper we show that lisse extension preserves the formalism of Grothendieck's six operations: more precisely, the lisse extension of a weave on schemes determines a weave on (higher) Artin stacks. The setup is general enough to apply to the stable motivic homotopy category with the six functor formalism of Voevodsky-Ayoub-Cisinski-Deglise, for instance, and is not specific to algebraic geometry: for example, it also applies to sheaves of spectra on topological stacks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Techniques for coordination of multi-agent systems are vast and varied, often utilizing purpose-built solvers or controllers with tight coupling to the types of systems involved or the coordination goal. In this paper, we introduce a general unified framework for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination using the language of cellular sheaves and nonlinear sheaf Laplacians, which are generalizations of graphs and graph Laplacians. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a nonlinear homological program encompassing a choice of cellular sheaf on an undirected graph, nonlinear edge potential functions, and constrained convex node objectives, which constitutes a standard form for a wide class of coordination problems. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers to derive a distributed optimization algorithm for solving these nonlinear homological programs. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework, we show how heterogeneous coordination goals including combinations of consensus, formation, and flocking can be formulated as nonlinear homological programs and provide numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our distributed solution algorithm.</description>
