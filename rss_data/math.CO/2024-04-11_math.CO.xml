      <title>The Stanley-Stembridge Conjecture for $\bf 2 + 1 +1$-avoiding unit interval orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural unit interval order is a naturally labelled partially ordered set that avoids patterns ${\bf 3 + \bf 1}$ and $\bf 2 + 2$. To each natural unit interval order one can associate a symmetric function. The Stanley-Stembridge conjecture states that each such symmetric function is positive in the basis of complete homogenous symmetric functions. This conjecture has connections to cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties, and to Kazhdan-Lusztig theory. We prove the conjecture for the special case when the unit interval order additionally avoids pattern $\bf 2 + 1 + 1$.</description>

      <title>Frogs, hats and common subsequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Write $W^{(n)}$ to mean the $n$-letter word obtained by repeating a fixed word $W$ and let $R_n$ denote a uniformly random $n$-letter word sampled from the same alphabet as $W$. We are interested in the average length of the longest common subsequence between $W^{(n)}$ and $R_n$, which is known to be $\gamma(W)\cdot n+o(n)$ for some constant $\gamma(W)$. Bukh and Cox recently developed an interacting particle system, dubbed the frog dynamics, which can be used to compute the constant $\gamma(W)$ for any fixed word $W$. They successfully analyzed the simplest case of the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots k)$. We continue this study by using the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots kk\cdots 21)$. The frog dynamics in this case is a variation of the PushTASEP on the ring where some clocks are identical. Interestingly, exclusion processes with correlated clocks of this type appear to have not been analyzed before. Our analysis leads to a seemingly new combinatorial object which could be of independent interest: frogs with hats!</description>

      <title>Generalized Quasikernels in Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a digraph $D$, we say that a set of vertices $Q\subseteq V(D)$ is a $q$-kernel if $Q$ is an independent set and if every vertex of $D$ can be reached from $Q$ by a path of length at most $q$. In this paper, we initiate the study of several extremal problems for $q$-kernels. For example, we introduce and make progress on (what turns out to be) a weak version of the Small Quasikernel Conjecture, namely that every digraph contains a $q$-kernel with $|N^+[Q]|\ge \frac{1}{2}|V(D)|$ for all $q\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Strong bounds for skew corner-free sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to matrix multiplication algorithms, Pratt asked (ITCS'24) how large a subset of $[n] \times [n]$ could be without containing a skew-corner: three points $(x,y), (x,y+h),(x+h,y')$ with $h \ne 0$. We prove any skew corner-free set has size at most $\exp(-\Omega(\log^{1/12} n))\cdot n^2$, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\exp(-O(\sqrt{\log n}))\cdot n^2$ by Beker (arXiv'24). Our techniques generalize those of Kelley and Meka's recent breakthrough on three-term arithmetic progression (FOCS'23), answering a question of Beker (arXiv'24).</description>

      <title>The immersion poset on partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the immersion poset $(\mathcal{P}(n), \leqslant_I)$ on partitions, defined by $\lambda \leqslant_I \mu$ if and only if $s_\mu(x_1, \ldots, x_N) - s_\lambda(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ is monomial-positive. Relations in the immersion poset determine when irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_N(\mathbb{C})$ form an immersion pair, as defined by Prasad and Raghunathan (2022). We develop injections $\mathsf{SSYT}(\lambda, \nu) \hookrightarrow \mathsf{SSYT}(\mu, \nu)$ on semistandard Young tableaux given constraints on the shape of $\lambda$, and present results on immersion relations among hook and two column partitions. The standard immersion poset $(\mathcal{P}(n), \leqslant_{std})$ is a refinement of the immersion poset, defined by $\lambda \leqslant_{std} \mu$ if and only if $\lambda \leqslant_D \mu$ in dominance order and $f^\lambda \leqslant f^\mu$, where $f^\nu$ is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape $\nu$. We classify maximal elements of certain shapes in the standard immersion poset using the hook length formula. Finally, we prove Schur-positivity of power sum symmetric functions $p_{A_\mu}$ on conjectured lower intervals in the immersion poset, addressing questions posed by Sundaram (2018).</description>

      <title>Hook length biases in ordinary and $t$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study hook lengths of ordinary partitions and $t$-regular partitions. We establish hook length biases for the ordinary partitions and motivated by them we find a few interesting hook length biases in $2$-regular partitions. For a positive integer $k$, let $p_{(k)}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the partitions of $n$. We prove that $p_{(k)}(n)\geq p_{(k+1)}(n)$ for all $n\geq0$ and $n\ne k+1$; and $p_{(k)}(k+1)- p_{(k+1)}(k+1)=-1$ for $k\geq 2$. For integers $t\geq2$ and $k\geq1$, let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. We find generating functions of $b_{t,k}(n)$ for certain values of $t$ and $k$. Exploring hook length biases for $b_{t,k}(n)$, we observe that in certain cases biases are opposite to the biases for ordinary partitions. We prove that $b_{2,2}(n)\geq b_{2,1}(n)$ for all $n&gt;4$, whereas $b_{2,2}(n)\geq b_{2,3}(n)$ for all $n\geq 0$. Our proofs are both combinatorial and analytic in nature. We also propose some conjectures on biases among $b_{t,k}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Extremal triangle-free graphs with chromatic number at least four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex triangle-free graph. The celebrated Mantel's theorem showed that $e(G)\leq \lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$. In 1962, Erd\H{o}s (together with Gallai), and independently Andr\'{a}sfai, proved that if $G$ is non-bipartite then $e(G)\leq \lfloor\frac{(n-1)^2}{4}\rfloor+1$. In this paper, we extend this result and show that if $G$ has chromatic number at least four and $n\geq 150$, then $e(G)\leq \lfloor\frac{(n-3)^2}{4}\rfloor+5$. The blow-up of Gr\"{o}tzsch graph shows that this bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>Poset Positional Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of positional games, supplementing them with a restriction on the order in which the elements of the board are allowed to be claimed. We introduce poset positional games, which are positional games with an additional structure -- a poset on the elements of the board. Throughout the game play, based on this poset and the set of the board elements that are claimed up to that point, we reduce the set of available moves for the player whose turn it is -- an element of the board can only be claimed if all the smaller elements in the poset are already claimed.
  We proceed to analyse these games in more detail, with a prime focus on the most studied convention, the Maker-Breaker games. First we build a general framework around poset positional games. Then, we perform a comprehensive study of the complexity of determining the game outcome, conditioned on the structure of the family of winning sets on the one side and the structure of the poset on the other.</description>

      <title>Generation of $3$-connected, planar line graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify and construct all line graphs that are $3$-polytopes (planar and $3$-connected). Apart from a few special cases, they are all obtained starting from the medial graphs of cubic (i.e., $3$-regular) $3$-polytopes, by applying two types of graph transformations. This is similar to the generation of other subclasses of $3$-polytopes.</description>

      <title>Beyond recognizing well-covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a number of results related to the computational complexity of recognizing well-covered graphs. Let $k$ and $s$ be positive integers and let $G$ be a graph. Then $G$ is said
  - $\mathbf{W_k}$ if for any $k$ pairwise disjoint independent vertex sets $A_1, \dots, A_k$ in $G$, there exist $k$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets $S_1, \dots,S_k$ in $G$ such that $A_i \subseteq S_i$ for $i \in [k]$.
  - $\mathbf{E_s}$ if every independent set in $G$ of size at most $s$ is contained in a maximum independent set in $G$.
  Chv\'atal and Slater (1993) and Sankaranarayana and Stewart (1992) famously showed that recognizing $\mathbf{W_1}$ graphs or, equivalently, well-covered graphs is coNP-complete. We extend this result by showing that recognizing $\mathbf{W_{k+1}}$ graphs in either $\mathbf{W_k}$ or $\mathbf{E_s}$ graphs is coNP-complete. This answers a question of Levit and Tankus (2023) and strengthens a theorem of Feghali and Marin (2024). We also show that recognizing $\mathbf{E_{s+1}}$ graphs is $\Theta_2^p$-complete even in $\mathbf{E_s}$ graphs, where $\Theta_2^p = \text{P}^{\text{NP}[\log]}$ is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time using a logarithmic number of calls to a SAT oracle. This strengthens a theorem of Berg\'e, Busson, Feghali and Watrigant (2023). We also obtain the complete picture of the complexity of recognizing chordal $\mathbf{W_k}$ and $\mathbf{E_s}$ graphs which, in particular, simplifies and generalizes a result of Dettlaff, Henning and Topp (2023).</description>

      <title>Results on pattern avoidance in parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study two notions of pattern avoidance in parking functions. First, for any collection of length 3 patterns, we compute the number of parking functions of size $n$ that avoid them under the first notion. This is motivated by recent work of Adeniran and Pudwell, who obtained analogous results using a second notion of pattern avoidance. Then, we provide new purely bijective proofs for two of their results, and improve the formula of another one. Finally, we apply similar enumeration techniques to the work of Novelli and Thibon on certain Hopf algebras of generalised parking functions, and compute their graded dimensions.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of higher-categorical diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a book on higher-categorical diagrams, including pasting diagrams. It aims to provide a thorough and modern reference on the subject, collecting, revisiting and expanding results scattered across the literature, informed by recent advances and practical experience with higher-dimensional diagram rewriting.
  We approach the subject as a kind of directed combinatorial topology: a diagram is a map from a "directed cell complex", encoded combinatorially as a face poset together with orientation data. Unlike previous expositions, we adopt from the beginning a functorial viewpoint, focussing on morphisms and categorical constructions. We do not tie ourselves to a specific model of higher categories, and instead treat diagrams as independent combinatorial structures that admit functorial interpretations in various contexts.
  Topics covered include the theory of layerings of diagrams; acyclicity properties and their consequences; constructions including Gray products, suspensions, and joins; special shapes such as globes, oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes; the interpretation of diagrams in strict omega-categories and their geometric realisation as simplicial and CW complexes; and Steiner's theory of directed chain complexes.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rikicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is accurately approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph independence (also known as $\epsilon$-independence or $\lambda$-independence) is a mixture of classical independence and free independence corresponding to graph products or groups and operator algebras. Using conjugation by certain random permutation matrices, we construct random matrix models for graph independence with amalgamation over the diagonal matrices. This yields a new probabilist,ic proof that graph products of sofic groups are sofic.</description>

      <title>Glauber dynamics for the hard-core model on bounded-degree $H$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hard-core model has as its configurations the independent sets of some graph instance $G$. The probability distribution on independent sets is controlled by a `fugacity' $\lambda&gt;0$, with higher $\lambda$ leading to denser configurations. We investigate the mixing time of Glauber (single-site) dynamics for the hard-core model on restricted classes of bounded-degree graphs in which a particular graph $H$ is excluded as an induced subgraph. If $H$ is a subdivided claw then, for all $\lambda$, the mixing time is $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the order of $G$. This extends a result of Chen and Gu for claw-free graphs. When $H$ is a path, the set of possible instances is finite. For all other $H$, the mixing time is exponential in $n$ for sufficiently large $\lambda$, depending on $H$ and the maximum degree of $G$.</description>

Abstract: The VT and Helberg codes, both in binary and non-binary forms, stand as elegant solutions for rectifying insertion and deletion errors. In this paper we consider the quaternary versions of these codes. It is well known that many optimal binary non-linear codes like Kerdock and Prepreta can be depicted as Gray images (isometry) of codes defined over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. Thus a natural question arises: Can we find similar maps between quaternary and binary spaces which gives interesting properties when applied to the VT and Helberg codes. We found several such maps called Naisargik (natural) maps and we study the images of quaternary VT and Helberg codes under these maps. Naisargik and inverse Naisargik images gives interesting error-correcting properties for VT and Helberg codes. If two Naisargik images of VT code generates an intersecting one deletion sphere, then the images holds the same weights. A quaternary Helberg code designed to correct $s$ deletions can effectively rectify $s+1$ deletion errors when considering its Naisargik image, and $s$-deletion correcting binary Helberg code can corrects $\lfloor\frac{s}{2}\rfloor$ errors with inverse Naisargik image.</description>

      <title>An efficient uniqueness theorem for overcomplete tensor decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new, constructive uniqueness theorem for tensor decomposition. It applies to order 3 tensors of format $n \times n \times p$ and can prove uniqueness of decomposition for generic tensors up to rank $r=4n/3$ as soon as $p \geq 4$. One major advantage over Kruskal's uniqueness theorem is that our theorem has an algorithmic proof, and the resulting algorithm is efficient. Like the uniqueness theorem, it applies in the range $n \leq r \leq 4n/3$. As a result, we obtain the first efficient algorithm for overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of order 3.
  For instance, prior to this work it was not known how to efficiently decompose generic tensors of format $n \times n \times n$ and rank $r=1.01n$ (or rank $r \leq (1+\epsilon) n$, for some constant $\epsilon &gt;0$). Efficient overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of format $n \times n \times 3$ remains an open problem.
  Our results are based on the method of commuting extensions pioneered by Strassen for the proof of his $3n/2$ lower bound on tensor rank and border rank. In particular, we rely on an algorithm for the computation of commuting extensions recently proposed in a companion paper, and on the classical diagonalization-based "Jennrich algorithm" for undercomplete tensor decomposition.</description>

      <title>Diagram Analysis of Iterative Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of first-order iterative algorithms which includes power iteration, belief propagation and Approximate Message Passing (AMP), and many forms of gradient descent. When the input is a random matrix with i.i.d. entries, we present a new way to analyze these algorithms using combinatorial diagrams. Each diagram is a small graph, and the operations of the algorithm correspond to simple combinatorial operations on these graphs.
  We prove a fundamental property of the diagrams: asymptotically, we can discard all of the diagrams except for the trees. The mechanics of first-order algorithms simplify dramatically as the algorithmic operations have particularly simple and interpretable effects on the trees. We further show that the tree-shaped diagrams are essentially a basis of asymptotically independent Gaussian vectors.
  The tree approximation mirrors the assumption of the cavity method, a 40-year-old non-rigorous technique in statistical physics which has served as one of the most fundamental techniques in the field. We demonstrate the connection with the replica symmetric cavity method by "implementing" heuristic physics derivations into rigorous proofs. We rigorously establish that belief propagation is asymptotically equal to its associated AMP algorithm and we give a new simple proof of the state evolution formula for AMP.
  These results apply when the iterative algorithm runs for constantly many iterations. We then push the diagram analysis to a number of iterations that scales with the dimension $n$ of the input matrix. We prove that for debiased power iteration, the tree diagram representation accurately describes the dynamic all the way up to $n^{\Omega(1)}$ iterations. We conjecture that this can be extended up to $n^{1/2}$ iterations but no further. Our proofs use straightforward combinatorial arguments akin to the trace method from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Matroidal polynomials, their singularities, and applications to Feynman diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a matroid or flag of matroids we introduce several broad classes of polynomials satisfying Deletion-Contraction identities, and study their singularities.
  There are three main families of polynomials captured by our approach: matroidal polynomials on a matroid (including matroid basis polynomials, configuration polynomials, Tutte polynomials); flag matroidal polynomials on a flag matroid; and Feynman integrands. The last class includes under general kinematics the inhomogeneous Feynman diagram polynomials which naturally arise in the Lee--Pomeransky form of the Feynman integral attached to a Feynman diagram.
  Assuming that the primary underlying matroid is connected and of positive rank (and in the flag case, has rank at least two), we show: a) in positive characteristic, homogeneous matroidal polynomials are strongly $F$-regular; b) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the associated jet schemes of (flag) matroidal polynomials as well as those of Feynman integrands are irreducible. Consequently, all these polynomials have rational singularities (or are smooth).</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation is local</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastability thresholds lie at the heart of bootstrap percolation theory. Yet proving precise lower bounds is notoriously hard. We show that for two of the most classical models, two-neighbour and Frob\"ose, upper bounds are sharp to essentially arbitrary precision, by linking them to their local counterparts.
  In Frob\"ose bootstrap percolation, iteratively, any vertex of the square lattice that is the only healthy vertex of a $1\times1$ square becomes infected and infections never heal. We prove that if vertices are initially infected independently with probability $p\to0$, then with high probability the origin becomes infected after \[\exp\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6p}-\frac{\pi\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}{\sqrt p}+\frac{O(\log^2(1/p))}{\sqrt[3]p}\right)\] time steps. We achieve this by proposing a new paradigmatic view on bootstrap percolation based on locality. Namely, we show that studying the Frob\"ose model is equivalent in an extremely strong sense to studying its local version. As a result, we completely bypass Holroyd's classical but technical hierarchy method, yielding the first term above and systematically used throughout bootstrap percolation for the last two decades. Instead, the proof features novel links to large deviation theory, eigenvalue perturbations and others.
  We also use the locality viewpoint to resolve the so-called bootstrap percolation paradox. Indeed, we propose and implement an exact (deterministic) algorithm which exponentially outperforms previous Monte Carlo approaches. This allows us to clearly showcase and quantify the slow convergence we prove rigorously.
  The same approach applies, with more extensive computations, to the two-neighbour model, in which vertices are infected when they have at least two infected neighbours and do not recover. We expect it to be applicable to a wider range of models and correspondingly conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

Abstract: We define the root polytope of a regular oriented matroid, and show that the greedoid polynomial of an Eulerian branching greedoid rooted at vertex $v_0$ is equivalent to the $h^*$-polynomial of the root polytope of the dual of the graphic matroid.
  As the definition of the root polytope is independent of the vertex $v_0$, this gives a geometric proof for the root-independence of the greedoid polynomial for Eulerian branching greedoids, a fact which was first proved by Swee Hong Chan, K\'evin Perrot and Trung Van Pham using sandpile models. We also obtain that the greedoid polynomial does not change if we reverse every edge of an Eulerian digraph.</description>

      <title>On approximating the rank of graph divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baker and Norine initiated the study of graph divisors as a graph-theoretic analogue of the Riemann-Roch theory for Riemann surfaces. One of the key concepts of graph divisor theory is the {\it rank} of a divisor on a graph. The importance of the rank is well illustrated by Baker's {\it Specialization lemma}, stating that the dimension of a linear system can only go up under specialization from curves to graphs, leading to a fruitful interaction between divisors on graphs and curves.
  Due to its decisive role, determining the rank is a central problem in graph divisor theory. Kiss and T\'othm\'eresz reformulated the problem using chip-firing games, and showed that computing the rank of a divisor on a graph is NP-hard via reduction from the Minimum Feedback Arc Set problem.
  In this paper, we strengthen their result by establishing a connection between chip-firing games and the Minimum Target Set Selection problem. As a corollary, we show that the rank is difficult to approximate to within a factor of $O(2^{\log^{1-\varepsilon}n})$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ unless $P=NP$. Furthermore, assuming the Planted Dense Subgraph Conjecture, the rank is difficult to approximate to within a factor of $O(n^{1/4-\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: For a set $L$ of positive proper fractions and a positive integer $r \geq 2$, a fractional $r$-closed $L$-intersecting family is a collection $\mathcal{F} \subset \mathcal{P}([n])$ with the property that for any $2 \leq t \leq r$ and $A_1, \dotsc, A_t \in \mathcal{F}$ there exists $\theta \in L$ such that $\lvert A_1 \cap \dotsb \cap A_t \rvert \in \{ \theta \lvert A_1 \rvert, \dotsc, \theta \lvert A_t \rvert\}$. In this paper we show that for $r \geq 3$ and $L = \{\theta\}$ any fractional $r$-closed $\theta$-intersecting family has size at most linear in $n$, and this is best possible up to a constant factor. We also show that in the case $\theta = 1/2$ we have a tight upper bound of $\lfloor \frac{3n}{2} \rfloor - 2$ and that a maximal $r$-closed $(1/2)$-intersecting family is determined uniquely up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Catching a robber on a random $k$-uniform hypergraph</title>

Abstract: The game of \emph{Cops and Robber} is usually played on a graph, where a group of cops attempt to catch a robber moving along the edges of the graph. The \emph{cop number} of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to win the game. An important conjecture in this area, due to Meyniel, states that the cop number of an $n$-vertex connected graph is $O(\sqrt{n})$. In 2016, Pra{\l}at and Wormald [Meyniel's conjecture holds for random graphs, Random Structures Algorithms. 48 (2016), no. 2, 396-421. MR3449604] showed that this conjecture holds with high probability for random graphs above the connectedness threshold. Moreoever, {\L}uczak and Pra{\l}at [Chasing robbers on random graphs: Zigzag theorem, Random Structures Algorithms. 37 (2010), no. 4, 516-524. MR2760362] showed that on a $\log$-scale the cop number demonstrates a surprising \emph{zigzag} behaviour in dense regimes of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$. In this paper, we consider the game of Cops and Robber on a hypergraph, where the players move along hyperedges instead of edges. We show that with high probability the cop number of the $k$-uniform binomial random hypergraph $G^k(n,p)$ is $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{k}}\, \log n \right)$ for a broad range of parameters $p$ and $k$ and that on a $\log$-scale our upper bound on the cop number arises as the minimum of \emph{two} complementary zigzag curves, as opposed to the case of $G(n,p)$. Furthermore, we conjecture that the cop number of a connected $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices is $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{k}}\,\right)$.</description>

      <title>Arc weighted acyclic orientations and variations of degeneracy of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies generalizations of the concept of acyclic orientations to arc-weighted orientations. These lead to four types of variations of strict degeneracy of graphs. Some of these variations are studied in the literature under different names and we put them in a same framework for comparison. Then we concentrate on one of these variations, which is new and is defined as follows: For a graph $G$ and a mapping $f \in \mathbb{N}^G$, we say $G$ is
  $ST^{(2)}$-$f$-degenerate if there is an arc-weighted orientation $(D, w)$ of $G$ such that $d_{(D,w)}^+(v) &lt; f(v)$ for each vertex $v$, and every sub-digraph $D'$ of $D$ contains an arc $e=(u,v)$ with
  $w(e) &gt; d_{(D', w)}^+(v)$.
  We prove that if $G$ is $ST^{(2)}$-$f$-degenerate, then $G$ is $f$-paintable, as well as $f$-AT.
  Then we use $ST^{(2)}$-degeneracy to study truncated degree choosability of graphs. A graph $G$ is called $k$-truncated degree-choosable (respectively $ST^{(2)}$-$k$-truncated degree degenerate) if $G$ is $f$-choosable (respectively, $ST^{(2)}$-$f$-degenerate), where $f(v)= \min\{k, d_G(v)\}$.
  Richter asked whether every 3-connected non-complete planar graph is $6$-truncated-degree-choosable. We answer this question in negative by constructing a 3-connected non-complete planar graph which is not $7$-truncated-degree-choosable. On the other hand, we prove that every 3-connected non-complete planar graph is $ST^{(2)}$-$16$-truncated-degree-degenerate, and hence
  $16$-truncated-degree-choosable. We further prove that for an arbitrary proper minor closed family ${\mathcal G}$ of graphs, let $s$ be the minimum integer such that $K_{s,t} \notin \mathcal{G}$ for some $t$, then there is a constant $k$ such that every $s$-connected non-complete graph $G \in {\mathcal G}$ is $ST^{(2)}$-$k$-truncated-degree-degenerate and hence $k$-truncated-degree-choosable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study swap cosystolic expansion, a new expansion property of simplicial complexes. We prove lower bounds for swap coboundary expansion of spherical buildings and use them to lower bound swap cosystolic expansion of the LSV Ramanujan complexes. Our motivation is the recent work (in a companion paper) showing that swap cosystolic expansion implies agreement theorems. Together the two works show that these complexes support agreement tests in the low acceptance regime.
  Swap cosystolic expansion is defined by considering, for a given complex $X$, its faces complex $F^r X$, whose vertices are $r$-faces of $X$ and where two vertices are connected if their disjoint union is also a face in $X$. The faces complex $F^r X$ is a derandomizetion of the product of $X$ with itself $r$ times. The graph underlying $F^rX$ is the swap walk of $X$, known to have excellent spectral expansion. The swap cosystolic expansion of $X$ is defined to be the cosystolic expansion of $F^r X$.
  Our main result is a $\exp(-O(\sqrt r))$ lower bound on the swap coboundary expansion of the spherical building and the swap cosystolic expansion of the LSV complexes. For more general coboundary expanders we show a weaker lower bound of $exp(-O(r))$.</description>

Abstract: Harary and Lauri conjectured that the class reconstruction number of trees is 2, that is, each tree has two unlabelled vertex-deleted subtrees that are not both in the deck of any other tree. We show that each tree $T$ can be reconstructed up to isomorphism given two of its unlabelled subgraphs $T-u$ and $T-v$ under the assumption that $u$ and $v$ are chosen in a particular way. Our result does not completely resolve the conjecture of Harary and Lauri since the special property defining $u$ and $v$ cannot be recognised from the given subtrees $T-u$ and $T-v$.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we searh for monochromatic infinite additive structures involving polynomials on $\mathbb{N}$. Ultimately, we can build the following results: (1) For any $r\in \mathbb{N}$, any distinct natural numbers $a,b$ and any $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exist subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $|B|=r$ and $|C|=\infty$ such that there exists a color containing $B+aC$ and $B+bC$; (2) For any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ and any $P\in \mathbb{Z}[n]$ with positive leading coefficient and zero constant term, there exist infinite subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $P(C)\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $B\subset P(\mathbb{N})$ such that $B+P(C)$ is monochromatic. In fact, for the specific question considered by us, the above results may be the best.</description>

Abstract: A connected graph, on four or more vertices, is matching covered if every edge is present in some perfect matching. An ear decomposition theorem (similar to the one for $2$-connected graphs) exists for bipartite matching covered graphs due to Hetyei. From the results and proofs of Lov\'asz and Plummer, that rely on Hetyei's theorem, one may deduce that any minimal bipartite matching covered graph has at least $2(m-n+2)$ vertices of degree two (where minimal means that deleting any edge results in a graph that is not matching covered); such a graph is said to be extremal if it attains the stated lower bound.
  In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of the class of extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs. In particular, we prove that every such graph $G$ is obtained from two copies of a tree devoid of degree two vertices, say $T$ and $T'$, by adding edges -- each of which joins a leaf of $T$ with the corresponding leaf of $T'$.
  Apart from the aforementioned bound, there are four other bounds that appear in, or may be deduced from, the work of Lov\'asz and Plummer. Each of these bounds leads to a notion of extremality. In this paper, we obtain a complete characterization of all of these extremal classes and also establish relationships between them. Two of our characterizations are in the same spirit as the one stated above. For the remaining two extremal classes, we reduce each of them to one of the already characterized extremal classes using standard matching theoretic operations.</description>

      <title>On {\lambda}-backbone coloring of cliques with tree backbones in linear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.05772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $\lambda$-backbone coloring of a graph $G$ with its subgraph (also called a backbone) $H$ is a function $c \colon V(G) \rightarrow \{1,\dots, k\}$ ensuring that $c$ is a proper coloring of $G$ and for each $\{u,v\} \in E(H)$ it holds that $|c(u) - c(v)| \ge \lambda$. In this paper we propose a way to color cliques with tree and forest backbones in linear time that the largest color does not exceed $\max\{n, 2 \lambda\} + \Delta(H)^2 \lceil\log{n} \rceil$. This result improves on the previously existing approximation algorithms as it is $(\Delta(H)^2 \lceil\log{n} \rceil)$-absolutely approximate, i.e. with an additive error over the optimum. We also present an infinite family of trees $T$ with $\Delta(T) = 3$ for which the coloring of cliques with backbones $T$ require to use at least $\max\{n, 2 \lambda\} + \Omega(\log{n})$ colors for $\lambda$ close to $\frac{n}{2}$.</description>

      <title>On asymptotically automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of an asymptotically automatic sequence, which generalises the notion of an automatic sequence. While $k$-automatic sequences are characterised by finiteness of $k$-kernels, the $k$-kernels of asymptotically $k$-automatic sequences are only required to be finite up to equality almost everywhere. We prove basic closure properties and a linear bound on asymptotic subword complexity, show that results concerning frequencies of symbols are no longer true for the asymptotic analogue, and discuss some classification problems.</description>

      <title>Lots and Lots of Perrin-Type Primality Tests and Their Pseudo-Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Experimental Mathematics and Symbolic Computation (with Maple), to search for lots and lots of Perrin- and Lucas- style primality tests, and try to sort the wheat from the chaff. More impressively, we find quite a few such primality tests for which we can explicitly construct infinite families of pseudo-primes, rather, like in the cases of Perrin pseudo-primes and the famous Carmichael primes, only proving the mere existence of infinitely many of them.</description>

      <title>Surprising occurrences of order structures in mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order and symmetry are main structural principles in mathematics. We give five examples where on the face of it order is not apparent, but deeper investigations reveal that they are governed by order structures. These examples are finite topologies, associative algebras, subgroups of matrix groups, ideals in polynomial rings, and classes of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of Recurrence in Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-homogeneous random walks on the positive quadrant in two dimensions. In the 1960's the following question was asked: is it true if such a random walk $X$ is recurrent and $Y$ is another random walk that at every point is more likely to go down and more likely to go left than $Y$, then $Y$ is also recurrent?
  We provide an example showing that the answer is negative. We also show that if either the random walk $X$ or $Y$ is sufficiently homogeneous then the answer is in fact positive.</description>
