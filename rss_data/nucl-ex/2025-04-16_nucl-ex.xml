      <title>Charge radii of neutron-rich scandium isotopes and the seniority symmetry in the $0f_{7/2}$ shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear charge radii of neutron-rich $^{47-49}$Sc isotopes were measured using collinear laser spectroscopy at CERN-ISOLDE. The new data reveal that the charge radii of scandium isotopes exhibit a distinct trend between $N=20$ and $N=28$, with $^{41}$Sc and $^{49}$Sc isotopes having similar values, mirroring the closeness of the charge radii of $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. Theoretical models that successfully interpret the radii of calcium isotopes could not account for the observed behavior in scandium radii, in particular the reduced odd-even staggering. Remarkably, the inclusion of the new $^{49}$Sc radius data has unveiled a similar trend in the charge radii of $N=28$ isotones and $Z=20$ isotopes when adding the neutrons atop the $^{40}$Ca core and the protons atop the $^{48}$Ca core, respectively. We demonstrate that this trend is consistent with the prediction of the seniority model.</description>

      <title>Low-energy neutrino responses for 71Ga by electron capture rates, charge exchange reactions and shell model calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak Gamow-Teller (GT) responses for low-lying states in ${}^{71}\mathrm{Ga}$ are crucial for studying low-energy solar neutrinos and the Ga anomaly, i.e., the possible transition to the sterile state. The responses for the ground state, the first excited state, and the second excited state are evaluated for the first time using the experimental electron capture rates, the experimental charge exchange reaction (CER) rates corrected for the tensor-interaction effect and the theoretical interacting shell model (ISM) calculations. The contributions from the two excited states to the solar and ${}^{51}\mathrm{Cr}$ neutrinos are found to be $4.2 \pm 1.2\%$ of that for the ground state. This is slightly larger than the ISM values but little smaller than the CER values without corrections for the tensor interaction effect. The Ga anomaly is far beyond the uncertainty of the obtained nuclear responses.</description>

      <title>Global $\Lambda$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD), the global $\Lambda$ polarization ($P_\Lambda$) is calculated in Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq$ 9 GeV, in which high baryon density is achieved. Various contributions to $P_\Lambda$ are considered: those from the thermal vorticity, meson field, thermal shear and spin-Hall effect. Feed-down from higher-lying resonances is also taken into account. The results are compared with available data. Special attention is payed to the collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV, for which a thorough scan of the energy, rapidity, and centrality dependence of $P_\Lambda$ is performed. The results for 3 GeV reasonably well reproduce the corresponding STAR data. While the results at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV can be considered as predictions for results of measurements within the STAR fixed-target (STAR-FXT) programthat are expected in the nearest future. It is predicted that a broad maximum of $P_\Lambda$ is reached at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3--3.9 GeV, exact position of which depends on the centrality and width of the midrapidity range of observation. Impact of the meson-field, thermal-shear and spin-Hall-effect contributions to $P_\Lambda$ is also studied.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.069 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.356 eV [Zhang et al., Nature 633, 63 (2024)]. Therefore, the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion provides a unique opportunity to study the nuclear excitation by electron transition process under well-defined atomic conditions in the regime of extremely low nuclear excitation energy. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.27\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV), but drops many orders of magnitude for the value of electronic transition energy within its uncertainty interval. Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap, the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from a few to approximately $7\times10^{19}$ $^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Universal Mass Equation for Equal-Quantum Excited-States Sets I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of fifteen baryon sets and twenty-four meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states, using Breit-Wigner PDG masses and their uncertainties at fixed $J^P$ for baryons and $J^{PC}$ for mesons, are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithmic function, $M_n = \alpha Ln(n) + \beta$, where $n$ is the level of radial excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryons (including LHCb exotic $P_{c\bar{c}}^+$s) and meson excited states (including $s\bar{s}$, $s\bar{c}$, $c\bar{c}$, $c\bar{b}$, and $b\bar{b}$ states) are related by the logarithmic function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states. The baryon ``star'' rating case is evaluated. The Cornell potential is an example of how a logarithmic behavior can be explained by an appropriate potential. Thus, a ``universal mass equation'' (UME) for equal-quantum excited-state sets is presented.</description>

      <title>Level-anticrossing in B(E2) anomaly (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new mechanism for explaining the B(E2) anomaly was given by F. Pan \emph{et al.} (PRC, 110, 054324, 2024), which is realized in the parameter region from the SU(3) symmetry limit to the O(6) symmetry limit, and seems to be not related to the SU(3) symmetry. However, through SU(3) analysis, a new technique proposed recently, we found that it is not so. The new mechanism is related to level-anticrossing phenomenon, which is related to level-crossing phenomenon in the SU(3) symmetry limit. By incorporating previous ideas, we have a more general explanatory framework for the B(E2) anomaly, which is important for understanding some higher-order interactions in the interacting boson model. Through analysis, it is shown that level-anticrossing in this mechanism mainly results from the third-order interaction $[\hat{L}\times \hat{Q}_{\chi} \times \hat{L}]^{(0)}$. Finally, the B(E2) anomaly in $^{170}$Os is also discussed within this general framework.</description>
