      <title>Network reconstruction via the minimum description length principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. As we demonstrate, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.</description>

      <title>Investigating Self-Supervised Image Denoising with Denaturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning for image denoising problems in the presence of denaturation for noisy data is a crucial approach in machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</description>

      <title>Random Pareto front surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pareto front of a set of vectors is the subset which is comprised solely of all of the best trade-off points. By interpolating this subset, we obtain the optimal trade-off surface. In this work, we prove a very useful result which states that all Pareto front surfaces can be explicitly parametrised using polar coordinates. In particular, our polar parametrisation result tells us that we can fully characterise any Pareto front surface using the length function, which is a scalar-valued function that returns the projected length along any positive radial direction. Consequently, by exploiting this representation, we show how it is possible to generalise many useful concepts from linear algebra, probability and statistics, and decision theory to function over the space of Pareto front surfaces. Notably, we focus our attention on the stochastic setting where the Pareto front surface itself is a stochastic process. Among other things, we showcase how it is possible to define and estimate many statistical quantities of interest such as the expectation, covariance and quantile of any Pareto front surface distribution. As a motivating example, we investigate how these statistics can be used within a design of experiments setting, where the goal is to both infer and use the Pareto front surface distribution in order to make effective decisions. Besides this, we also illustrate how these Pareto front ideas can be used within the context of extreme value theory. Finally, as a numerical example, we applied some of our new methodology on a real-world air pollution data set.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating cybersecurity risk in electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the safe operation of collective EV chargings, the stability of the power grid, and the cost-effective infrastructure expansion. However, existing methods either suffer from the data privacy issue and the susceptibility to cyberattacks or fail to consider the spatial correlation among different stations. To address these challenges, a federated graph learning approach involving multiple charging stations is proposed to collaboratively train a more generalized deep learning model for demand forecasting while capturing spatial correlations among various stations and enhancing robustness against potential attacks. Firstly, for better model performance, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is leveraged to characterize the geographic correlation among different charging stations in a federated manner. Secondly, to ensure robustness and deal with the data heterogeneity in a federated setting, a message passing that utilizes a global attention mechanism to aggregate personalized models for each client is proposed. Thirdly, by concerning cyberattacks, a special credit-based function is designed to mitigate potential threats from malicious clients or unwanted attacks. Extensive experiments on a public EV charging dataset are conducted using various deep learning techniques and federated learning methods to demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Review of Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Error Exponent in Agnostic PAC Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical learning theory and the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) criterion are the common approach to mathematical learning theory. PAC is widely used to analyze learning problems and algorithms, and have been studied thoroughly. Uniform worst case bounds on the convergence rate have been well established using, e.g., VC theory or Radamacher complexity. However, in a typical scenario the performance could be much better. In this paper, we consider PAC learning using a somewhat different tradeoff, the error exponent - a well established analysis method in Information Theory - which describes the exponential behavior of the probability that the risk will exceed a certain threshold as function of the sample size. We focus on binary classification and find, under some stability assumptions, an improved distribution dependent error exponent for a wide range of problems, establishing the exponential behavior of the PAC error probability in agnostic learning. Interestingly, under these assumptions, agnostic learning may have the same error exponent as realizable learning. The error exponent criterion can be applied to analyze knowledge distillation, a problem that so far lacks a theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Locality Regularized Reconstruction: Structured Sparsity and Delaunay Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear representation learning is widely studied due to its conceptual simplicity and empirical utility in tasks such as compression, classification, and feature extraction. Given a set of points $[\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n] = \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ and a vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to find coefficients $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ so that $\mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} \approx \mathbf{y}$, subject to some desired structure on $\mathbf{w}$. In this work we seek $\mathbf{w}$ that forms a local reconstruction of $\mathbf{y}$ by solving a regularized least squares regression problem. We obtain local solutions through a locality function that promotes the use of columns of $\mathbf{X}$ that are close to $\mathbf{y}$ when used as a regularization term. We prove that, for all levels of regularization and under a mild condition that the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ have a unique Delaunay triangulation, the optimal coefficients' number of non-zero entries is upper bounded by $d+1$, thereby providing local sparse solutions when $d \ll n$. Under the same condition we also show that for any $\mathbf{y}$ contained in the convex hull of $\mathbf{X}$ there exists a regime of regularization parameter such that the optimal coefficients are supported on the vertices of the Delaunay simplex containing $\mathbf{y}$. This provides an interpretation of the sparsity as having structure obtained implicitly from the Delaunay triangulation of $\mathbf{X}$. We demonstrate that our locality regularized problem can be solved in comparable time to other methods that identify the containing Delaunay simplex.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Learning Monophonic Halfspaces in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a binary classifier on the vertices of a graph. In particular, we consider classifiers given by monophonic halfspaces, partitions of the vertices that are convex in a certain abstract sense. Monophonic halfspaces, and related notions such as geodesic halfspaces,have recently attracted interest, and several connections have been drawn between their properties(e.g., their VC dimension) and the structure of the underlying graph $G$. We prove several novel results for learning monophonic halfspaces in the supervised, online, and active settings. Our main result is that a monophonic halfspace can be learned with near-optimal passive sample complexity in time polynomial in $n = |V(G)|$. This requires us to devise a polynomial-time algorithm for consistent hypothesis checking, based on several structural insights on monophonic halfspaces and on a reduction to $2$-satisfiability. We prove similar results for the online and active settings. We also show that the concept class can be enumerated with delay $\operatorname{poly}(n)$, and that empirical risk minimization can be performed in time $2^{\omega(G)}\operatorname{poly}(n)$ where $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. These results answer open questions from the literature (Gonz\'alez et al., 2020), and show a contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which some of the said problems are NP-hard (Seiffarth et al., 2023).</description>

      <title>Accelerated Fully First-Order Methods for Bilevel and Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm member for accelerating first-order methods for bilevel optimization, namely the \emph{(Perturbed) Restarted Accelerated Fully First-order methods for Bilevel Approximation}, abbreviated as \texttt{(P)RAF${}^2$BA}. The algorithm leverages \emph{fully} first-order oracles and seeks approximate stationary points in nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization, enhancing oracle complexity for efficient optimization. Theoretical guarantees for finding approximate first-order stationary points and second-order stationary points at the state-of-the-art query complexities are established, showcasing their effectiveness in solving complex optimization tasks. Empirical studies for real-world problems are provided to further validate the outperformance of our proposed algorithms. The significance of \texttt{(P)RAF${}^2$BA} in optimizing nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization problems is underscored by its state-of-the-art convergence rates and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>New bounds on the cohesion of complete-link and other linkage methods for agglomeration clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linkage methods are among the most popular algorithms for hierarchical clustering. Despite their relevance the current knowledge regarding the quality of the clustering produced by these methods is limited. Here, we improve the currently available bounds on the maximum diameter of the clustering obtained by complete-link for metric spaces.
  One of our new bounds, in contrast to the existing ones, allows us to separate complete-link from single-link in terms of approximation for the diameter, which corroborates the common perception that the former is more suitable than the latter when the goal is producing compact clusters.
  We also show that our techniques can be employed to derive upper bounds on the cohesion of a class of linkage methods that includes the quite popular average-link.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Adversarial Restless Multi-Armed Bandits with Unknown Transitions and Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) play a central role in modeling sequential decision making problems under an instantaneous activation constraint that at most B arms can be activated at any decision epoch. Each restless arm is endowed with a state that evolves independently according to a Markov decision process regardless of being activated or not. In this paper, we consider the task of learning in episodic RMAB with unknown transition functions and adversarial rewards, which can change arbitrarily across episodes. Further, we consider a challenging but natural bandit feedback setting that only adversarial rewards of activated arms are revealed to the decision maker (DM). The goal of the DM is to maximize its total adversarial rewards during the learning process while the instantaneous activation constraint must be satisfied in each decision epoch. We develop a novel reinforcement learning algorithm with two key contributors: a novel biased adversarial reward estimator to deal with bandit feedback and unknown transitions, and a low-complexity index policy to satisfy the instantaneous activation constraint. We show $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for our algorithm, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the episode length. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for adversarial RMAB in our considered challenging settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Thompson Sampling-based algorithms for stochastic bandits with bounded rewards. As the existing problem-dependent regret bound for Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors [Agrawal and Goyal, 2017] is vacuous when $T \le 288 e^{64}$, we derive a more practical bound that tightens the coefficient of the leading term %from $288 e^{64}$ to $1270$. Additionally, motivated by large-scale real-world applications that require scalability, adaptive computational resource allocation, and a balance in utility and computation, we propose two parameterized Thompson Sampling-based algorithms: Thompson Sampling with Model Aggregation (TS-MA-$\alpha$) and Thompson Sampling with Timestamp Duelling (TS-TD-$\alpha$), where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ controls the trade-off between utility and computation. Both algorithms achieve $O \left(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta \right)$ regret bound, where $K$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the finite learning horizon, and $\Delta$ denotes the single round performance loss when pulling a sub-optimal arm.</description>

      <title>The Privacy Power of Correlated Noise in Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning is appealing as it enables the scalable usage of large amounts of distributed data and resources (without resorting to any central entity), while promoting privacy since every user minimizes the direct exposure of their data. Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor, a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially, in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion SecLDP privacy accountant for public use.</description>

      <title>Tabular and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Gittins Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of multi-arm bandit problems, the Gittins index policy is known to be optimal in maximizing the expected total discounted reward obtained from pulling the Markovian arms. In most realistic scenarios however, the Markovian state transition probabilities are unknown and therefore the Gittins indices cannot be computed. One can then resort to reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that explore the state space to learn these indices while exploiting to maximize the reward collected. In this work, we propose tabular (QGI) and Deep RL (DGN) algorithms for learning the Gittins index that are based on the retirement formulation for the multi-arm bandit problem. When compared with existing RL algorithms that learn the Gittins index, our algorithms have a lower run time, require less storage space (small Q-table size in QGI and smaller replay buffer in DGN), and illustrate better empirical convergence to the Gittins index. This makes our algorithm well suited for problems with large state spaces and is a viable alternative to existing methods. As a key application, we demonstrate the use of our algorithms in minimizing the mean flowtime in a job scheduling problem when jobs are available in batches and have an unknown service time distribution. \</description>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have shown great promise in many classification applications, yet are widely known to have poorly calibrated predictions when they are over-parametrized. Improving DNN calibration without comprising on model accuracy is of extreme importance and interest in safety critical applications such as in the health-care sector. In this work, we show that decoupling the training of feature extraction layers and classification layers in over-parametrized DNN architectures such as Wide Residual Networks (WRN) and Visual Transformers (ViT) significantly improves model calibration whilst retaining accuracy, and at a low training cost. In addition, we show that placing a Gaussian prior on the last hidden layer outputs of a DNN, and training the model variationally in the classification training stage, even further improves calibration. We illustrate these methods improve calibration across ViT and WRN architectures for several image classification benchmark datasets.</description>

Abstract: Differentiable particle filters combine the flexibility of neural networks with the probabilistic nature of sequential Monte Carlo methods. However, traditional approaches rely on the availability of labelled data, i.e., the ground truth latent state information, which is often difficult to obtain in real-world applications. This paper compares the effectiveness of two semi-supervised training objectives for differentiable particle filters. We present results in two simulated environments where labelled data are scarce.</description>

      <title>Demistifying Inference after Adaptive Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive experiments such as multi-arm bandits adapt the treatment-allocation policy and/or the decision to stop the experiment to the data observed so far. This has the potential to improve outcomes for study participants within the experiment, to improve the chance of identifying best treatments after the experiment, and to avoid wasting data. Seen as an experiment (rather than just a continually optimizing system) it is still desirable to draw statistical inferences with frequentist guarantees. The concentration inequalities and union bounds that generally underlie adaptive experimentation algorithms can yield overly conservative inferences, but at the same time the asymptotic normality we would usually appeal to in non-adaptive settings can be imperiled by adaptivity. In this article we aim to explain why, how, and when adaptivity is in fact an issue for inference and, when it is, understand the various ways to fix it: reweighting to stabilize variances and recover asymptotic normality, always-valid inference based on joint normality of an asymptotic limiting sequence, and characterizing and inverting the non-normal distributions induced by adaptivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a significant focus on exploring the theoretical aspects of deep learning, especially regarding its performance in classification tasks. Bayesian deep learning has emerged as a unified probabilistic framework, seeking to integrate deep learning with Bayesian methodologies seamlessly. However, there exists a gap in the theoretical understanding of Bayesian approaches in deep learning for classification. This study presents an attempt to bridge that gap. By leveraging PAC-Bayes bounds techniques, we present theoretical results on the prediction or misclassification error of a probabilistic approach utilizing Spike-and-Slab priors for sparse deep learning in classification. We establish non-asymptotic results for the prediction error. Additionally, we demonstrate that, by considering different architectures, our results can achieve minimax optimal rates in both low and high-dimensional settings, up to a logarithmic factor. Moreover, our additional logarithmic term yields slight improvements over previous works. Additionally, we propose and analyze an automated model selection approach aimed at optimally choosing a network architecture with guaranteed optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical Bayesian learning often requires (1) online inference, (2) dynamic models, and (3) ensembling over multiple different models. Recent advances have shown how to use random feature approximations to achieve scalable, online ensembling of Gaussian processes with desirable theoretical properties and fruitful applications. One key to these methods' success is the inclusion of a random walk on the model parameters, which makes models dynamic. We show that these methods can be generalized easily to any basis expansion model and that using alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, often results in better performance. To simplify the process of choosing a specific basis expansion, our method's generality also allows the ensembling of several entirely different models, for example, a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Finally, we propose a novel method to ensemble static and dynamic models together.</description>

Abstract: We present a new random walk for uniformly sampling high-dimensional convex bodies. It achieves state-of-the-art runtime complexity with stronger guarantees on the output than previously known, namely in R\'enyi divergence (which implies TV, $\mathcal{W}_2$, KL, $\chi^2$). The proof departs from known approaches for polytime algorithms for the problem -- we utilize a stochastic diffusion perspective to show contraction to the target distribution with the rate of convergence determined by functional isoperimetric constants of the stationary density.</description>

      <title>Designing Algorithmic Recommendations to Achieve Human-AI Complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms frequently assist, rather than replace, human decision-makers. However, the design and analysis of algorithms often focus on predicting outcomes and do not explicitly model their effect on human decisions. This discrepancy between the design and role of algorithmic assistants becomes of particular concern in light of empirical evidence that suggests that algorithmic assistants again and again fail to improve human decisions. In this article, we formalize the design of recommendation algorithms that assist human decision-makers without making restrictive ex-ante assumptions about how recommendations affect decisions. We formulate an algorithmic-design problem that leverages the potential-outcomes framework from causal inference to model the effect of recommendations on a human decision-maker's binary treatment choice. Within this model, we introduce a monotonicity assumption that leads to an intuitive classification of human responses to the algorithm. Under this monotonicity assumption, we can express the human's response to algorithmic recommendations in terms of their compliance with the algorithm and the decision they would take if the algorithm sends no recommendation. We showcase the utility of our framework using an online experiment that simulates a hiring task. We argue that our approach explains the relative performance of different recommendation algorithms in the experiment, and can help design solutions that realize human-AI complementarity.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Generators for Disease Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A patient's digital twin is a computational model that describes the evolution of their health over time. Digital twins have the potential to revolutionize medicine by enabling individual-level computer simulations of human health, which can be used to conduct more efficient clinical trials or to recommend personalized treatment options. Due to the overwhelming complexity of human biology, machine learning approaches that leverage large datasets of historical patients' longitudinal health records to generate patients' digital twins are more tractable than potential mechanistic models. In this manuscript, we describe a neural network architecture that can learn conditional generative models of clinical trajectories, which we call Digital Twin Generators (DTGs), that can create digital twins of individual patients. We show that the same neural network architecture can be trained to generate accurate digital twins for patients across 13 different indications simply by changing the training set and tuning hyperparameters. By introducing a general purpose architecture, we aim to unlock the ability to scale machine learning approaches to larger datasets and across more indications so that a digital twin could be created for any patient in the world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian few-shot classification has been a focal point in the field of few-shot learning. This paper seamlessly integrates mirror descent-based variational inference into Gaussian process-based few-shot classification, addressing the challenge of non-conjugate inference. By leveraging non-Euclidean geometry, mirror descent achieves accelerated convergence by providing the steepest descent direction along the corresponding manifold. It also exhibits the parameterization invariance property concerning the variational distribution. Experimental results demonstrate competitive classification accuracy, improved uncertainty quantification, and faster convergence compared to baseline models. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameters and components. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/keanson/MD-BSFC.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of policy evaluation with linear function approximation in discounted infinite horizon Markov decision processes. We investigate the sample complexities required to guarantee a predefined estimation error of the best linear coefficients for two widely-used policy evaluation algorithms: the temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm and the two-timescale linear TD with gradient correction (TDC) algorithm. In both the on-policy setting, where observations are generated from the target policy, and the off-policy setting, where samples are drawn from a behavior policy potentially different from the target policy, we establish the first sample complexity bound with high-probability convergence guarantee that attains the optimal dependence on the tolerance level. We also exhihit an explicit dependence on problem-related quantities, and show in the on-policy setting that our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound on crucial problem parameters, including the choice of the feature maps and the problem dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Conformal Decision Theory, a framework for producing safe autonomous decisions despite imperfect machine learning predictions. Examples of such decisions are ubiquitous, from robot planning algorithms that rely on pedestrian predictions, to calibrating autonomous manufacturing to exhibit high throughput and low error, to the choice of trusting a nominal policy versus switching to a safe backup policy at run-time. The decisions produced by our algorithms are safe in the sense that they come with provable statistical guarantees of having low risk without any assumptions on the world model whatsoever; the observations need not be I.I.D. and can even be adversarial. The theory extends results from conformal prediction to calibrate decisions directly, without requiring the construction of prediction sets. Experiments demonstrate the utility of our approach in robot motion planning around humans, automated stock trading, and robot manufacturing.</description>

Abstract: Differential privacy has emerged as an significant cornerstone in the realm of scientific hypothesis testing utilizing confidential data. In reporting scientific discoveries, Bayesian tests are widely adopted since they effectively circumnavigate the key criticisms of P-values, namely, lack of interpretability and inability to quantify evidence in support of the competing hypotheses. We present a novel differentially private Bayesian hypotheses testing framework that arise naturally under a principled data generative mechanism, inherently maintaining the interpretability of the resulting inferences. Furthermore, by focusing on differentially private Bayes factors based on widely used test statistics, we circumvent the need to model the complete data generative mechanism and ensure substantial computational benefits. We also provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish results on Bayes factor consistency under the proposed framework. The utility of the devised technology is showcased via several numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: The inadequate mixing of conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for multi-modal distributions presents a significant challenge in practical applications such as Bayesian inference and molecular dynamics. Addressing this, we propose Diffusive Gibbs Sampling (DiGS), an innovative family of sampling methods designed for effective sampling from distributions characterized by distant and disconnected modes. DiGS integrates recent developments in diffusion models, leveraging Gaussian convolution to create an auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces. A novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme is proposed to enhance mixing in the denoising sampling step. DiGS exhibits a better mixing property for sampling multi-modal distributions than state-of-the-art methods such as parallel tempering, attaining substantially improved performance across various tasks, including mixtures of Gaussians, Bayesian neural networks and molecular dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Conformal prediction equips machine learning models with a reasonable notion of uncertainty quantification without making strong distributional assumptions. It wraps around any black-box prediction model and converts point predictions into set predictions that have a predefined marginal coverage guarantee. However, conformal prediction only works if we fix the underlying machine learning model in advance. A relatively unaddressed issue in conformal prediction is that of model selection and/or aggregation: for a given problem, which of the plethora of prediction methods (random forests, neural nets, regularized linear models, etc.) should we conformalize? This paper proposes a new approach towards conformal model aggregation in online settings that is based on combining the prediction sets from several algorithms by voting, where weights on the models are adapted over time based on past performance.</description>

      <title>How Deep Networks Learn Sparse and Hierarchical Data: the Sparse Random Hierarchy Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding what makes high-dimensional data learnable is a fundamental question in machine learning. On the one hand, it is believed that the success of deep learning lies in its ability to build a hierarchy of representations that become increasingly more abstract with depth, going from simple features like edges to more complex concepts. On the other hand, learning to be insensitive to invariances of the task, such as smooth transformations for image datasets, has been argued to be important for deep networks and it strongly correlates with their performance. In this work, we aim to explain this correlation and unify these two viewpoints. We show that by introducing sparsity to generative hierarchical models of data, the task acquires insensitivity to spatial transformations that are discrete versions of smooth transformations. In particular, we introduce the Sparse Random Hierarchy Model (SRHM), where we observe and rationalize that a hierarchical representation mirroring the hierarchical model is learnt precisely when such insensitivity is learnt, thereby explaining the strong correlation between the latter and performance. Moreover, we quantify how the sample complexity of CNNs learning the SRHM depends on both the sparsity and hierarchical structure of the task.</description>

Abstract: While neural networks can be approximated by linear models as their width increases, certain properties of wide neural networks cannot be captured by linear models. In this work we show that recently proposed Neural Quadratic Models can exhibit the "catapult phase" [Lewkowycz et al. 2020] that arises when training such models with large learning rates. We then empirically show that the behaviour of neural quadratic models parallels that of neural networks in generalization, especially in the catapult phase regime. Our analysis further demonstrates that quadratic models can be an effective tool for analysis of neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, an approach that has gained a lot of popularity to tackle nonparametric testing problems on general (i.e., non-Euclidean) domains is based on the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding of probability distributions. The main goal of our work is to understand the optimality of two-sample tests constructed based on this approach. First, we show the popular MMD (maximum mean discrepancy) two-sample test to be not optimal in terms of the separation boundary measured in Hellinger distance. Second, we propose a modification to the MMD test based on spectral regularization by taking into account the covariance information (which is not captured by the MMD test) and prove the proposed test to be minimax optimal with a smaller separation boundary than that achieved by the MMD test. Third, we propose an adaptive version of the above test which involves a data-driven strategy to choose the regularization parameter and show the adaptive test to be almost minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Moreover, our results hold for the permutation variant of the test where the test threshold is chosen elegantly through the permutation of the samples. Through numerical experiments on synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed test in comparison to the MMD test and other popular tests in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new regression framework designed to deal with large-scale, complex data that lies around a low-dimensional manifold with noises. Our approach first constructs a graph representation, referred to as the skeleton, to capture the underlying geometric structure. We then define metrics on the skeleton graph and apply nonparametric regression techniques, along with feature transformations based on the graph, to estimate the regression function. We also discuss the limitations of some nonparametric regressors with respect to the general metric space such as the skeleton graph. The proposed regression framework suggests a novel way to deal with data with underlying geometric structures and provides additional advantages in handling the union of multiple manifolds, additive noises, and noisy observations. We provide statistical guarantees for the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations and real data examples.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of finite-time identification of linear dynamical systems from $T$ samples of a single trajectory. Recent results have predominantly focused on the setup where no structural assumption is made on the system matrix $A^* \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, and have consequently analyzed the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator in detail. We assume prior structural information on $A^*$ is available, which can be captured in the form of a convex set $\mathcal{K}$ containing $A^*$. For the solution of the ensuing constrained least squares estimator, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds in the Frobenius norm that depend on the local size of $\mathcal{K}$ at $A^*$. To illustrate the usefulness of these results, we instantiate them for four examples, namely when (i) $A^*$ is sparse and $\mathcal{K}$ is a suitably scaled $\ell_1$ ball; (ii) $\mathcal{K}$ is a subspace; (iii) $\mathcal{K}$ consists of matrices each of which is formed by sampling a bivariate convex function on a uniform $n \times n$ grid (convex regression); (iv) $\mathcal{K}$ consists of matrices each row of which is formed by uniform sampling (with step size $1/T$) of a univariate Lipschitz function. In all these situations, we show that $A^*$ can be reliably estimated for values of $T$ much smaller than what is needed for the unconstrained setting.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Modular Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular approaches that use a different composition of modules for each problem are a promising direction in continual learning (CL). However, searching through the large, discrete space of module compositions is challenging, especially because evaluating a composition's performance requires a round of neural network training. We address this challenge through a modular CL framework, PICLE, that uses a probabilistic model to cheaply compute the fitness of each composition, allowing PICLE to achieve both perceptual, few-shot and latent transfer. The model combines prior knowledge about good module compositions with dataset-specific information. We evaluate PICLE using two benchmark suites designed to assess different desiderata of CL techniques. Comparing to a wide range of approaches, we show that PICLE is the first modular CL algorithm to achieve perceptual, few-shot and latent transfer while scaling well to large search spaces, outperforming previous state-of-the-art modular CL approaches on long problem sequences.</description>

      <title>Delegating Data Collection in Decentralized Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of decentralized machine learning (ML) ecosystems, we study the delegation of data collection. Taking the field of contract theory as our starting point, we design optimal and near-optimal contracts that deal with two fundamental information asymmetries that arise in decentralized ML: uncertainty in the assessment of model quality and uncertainty regarding the optimal performance of any model. We show that a principal can cope with such asymmetry via simple linear contracts that achieve 1-1/e fraction of the optimal utility. To address the lack of a priori knowledge regarding the optimal performance, we give a convex program that can adaptively and efficiently compute the optimal contract. We also study linear contracts and derive the optimal utility in the more complex setting of multiple interactions.</description>

      <title>Learning to Relax: Setting Solver Parameters Across a Sequence of Linear System Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving a linear system $Ax=b$ is a fundamental scientific computing primitive for which numerous solvers and preconditioners have been developed. These come with parameters whose optimal values depend on the system being solved and are often impossible or too expensive to identify; thus in practice sub-optimal heuristics are used. We consider the common setting in which many related linear systems need to be solved, e.g. during a single numerical simulation. In this scenario, can we sequentially choose parameters that attain a near-optimal overall number of iterations, without extra matrix computations? We answer in the affirmative for Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR), a standard solver whose parameter $\omega$ has a strong impact on its runtime. For this method, we prove that a bandit online learning algorithm--using only the number of iterations as feedback--can select parameters for a sequence of instances such that the overall cost approaches that of the best fixed $\omega$ as the sequence length increases. Furthermore, when given additional structural information, we show that a contextual bandit method asymptotically achieves the performance of the instance-optimal policy, which selects the best $\omega$ for each instance. Our work provides the first learning-theoretic treatment of high-precision linear system solvers and the first end-to-end guarantees for data-driven scientific computing, demonstrating theoretically the potential to speed up numerical methods using well-understood learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning to Embed Time Series Patches Independently</title>

Abstract: Masked time series modeling has recently gained much attention as a self-supervised representation learning strategy for time series. Inspired by masked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and partially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the dependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked patches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be an optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning to embed patches independently results in better time series representations. Specifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which autoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple patch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce complementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time series information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series forecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and training/inference time.

      <title>Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron &amp; Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for batch Bayesian Optimization (BO) called Thompson Sampling-Regret to Sigma Ratio directed sampling (TS-RSR), where we sample a new batch of actions by minimizing a Thompson Sampling approximation of a regret to uncertainty ratio. Our sampling objective is able to coordinate the actions chosen in each batch in a way that minimizes redundancy between points whilst focusing on points with high predictive means or high uncertainty. Theoretically, we provide rigorous convergence guarantees on our algorithm's regret, and numerically, we demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance on a range of challenging synthetic and realistic test functions, where it outperforms several competitive benchmark batch BO algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Hazard Function Based Efficient Multivariate Temporal Point Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing temporal point process models are characterized by conditional intensity function. These models often require numerical approximation methods for likelihood evaluation, which potentially hurts their performance. By directly modelling the integral of the intensity function, i.e., the cumulative hazard function (CHF), the likelihood can be evaluated accurately, making it a promising approach. However, existing CHF-based methods are not well-defined, i.e., the mathematical constraints of CHF are not completely satisfied, leading to untrustworthy results. For multivariate temporal point process, most existing methods model intensity (or density, etc.) functions for each variate, limiting the scalability. In this paper, we explore using neural networks to model a flexible but well-defined CHF and learning the multivariate temporal point process with low parameter complexity. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on data fitting and event prediction tasks while having significantly fewer parameters and memory usage than the strong competitors.

      <title>Automating the Discovery of Partial Differential Equations in Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from data is crucial for understanding the governing mechanisms of natural phenomena, yet it remains a challenging task. We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.</description>

      <title>KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</description>
