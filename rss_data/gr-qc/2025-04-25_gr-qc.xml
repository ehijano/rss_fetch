      <title>Global monopole as electrogravity dual of vacuum (electrovacuum)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By resolving the Riemann curvature into electric and magnetic parts, Einstein's equation can accordingly be written in terms of electric (active and passive) and magnetic parts. The electrogravity duality is defined by the interchange of active and passive parts. It turns out that in static and stationary spacetime, there is a subset of the equations (that identifies the effective vacuum equation) is sufficient to yield the vacuum solution. The electrogravity dual of the effective equation gives rise to a black hole with a global monopole charge. We shall therefore obtain black holes with global monopole charge as solutions of the dual equation.</description>

      <title>Prospects for gravitational wave and ultra-light dark matter detection with binary resonances beyond the secular approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision observations of orbital systems have recently emerged as a promising new means of detecting gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter, offering sensitivity in new regimes with significant discovery potential. These searches rely critically on precise modeling of the dynamical effects of these signals on the observed system; however, previous analyses have mainly only relied on the secularly-averaged part of the response. We introduce here a fundamentally different approach that allows for a fully time-resolved description of the effects of oscillatory metric perturbations on orbital dynamics. We find that gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter can induce large oscillations in the orbital parameters of realistic binaries, enhancing the sensitivity to such signals by orders of magnitude compared to previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Geodesic dynamics in brane-de Sitter wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical analysis of the null and timelike geodesics around an asymptotically de Sitter wormhole in a Randall-Sundrum brane. In this framework, the wormhole throat is interpreted both as a photon sphere and as a fixed point of the associated dynamical system. The stability of this structure is evaluated using Lyapunov and Jacobi criteria with consistent results. A Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation is observed in the null-geodesic dynamics, highlighting critical changes in the behavior of light around the wormhole. Explicit solutions are derived for geodesics near the throat, providing insight into the optical appearance of the wormhole shadow. These results show qualitatively similar behavior for null and timelike orbits, suggesting universal features of geodesic dynamics in brane-de Sitter wormholes.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian phase transitions on a generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the emergence of non-Hermitian phase transitions on a quantum wormhole surface. We consider a single fermion whose dynamics are governed by the Dirac equation confined to move on a quantum wormhole surface. The effects of the geometry are taken into account using the tetrad formalism and the spin connection. The Dirac equation gives rise to two coupled first-order differential equations for each spinor component. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for each spinor component are computed numerically, and the non-Hermitian phase transitions are investigated in terms of the geometric features of the wormhole and the magnitude of the imaginary component of the mass.</description>

      <title>Ringdown mode amplitudes of precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a binary black-hole merger encodes key information about the remnant properties and provides a direct probe of the strong-field regime of General Relativity. While quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times are well understood within black-hole perturbation theory, their excitation amplitudes remain challenging to model, as they depend on the merger phase. The complexity increases for precessing black-hole binaries, where multiple emission modes can contribute comparably to the ringdown. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of precessing binary black hole ringdowns using the SXS numerical relativity simulations catalog. Precession significantly impacts the ringdown excitation amplitudes and the related mode hierarchy. Using Gaussian process regression, we construct the first fits for the ringdown amplitudes of the most relevant modes in precessing systems.</description>

      <title>Lectures on measurement in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures present a brief introduction to measurement theory for QFT in possibly curved spacetimes introduced by the author and R. Verch [Comm. Math. Phys. 378 (2020) 851-889]. Topics include: a brief introduction to algebraic QFT, measurement schemes in QFT, state updates, multiple measurements and the resolution of Sorkin's "impossible measurement" problem. Examples using suitable theories based on Green hyperbolic operators are given, and the interpretational significance of the framework is briefly considered. The basic style is to give details relating to QFT while taking for granted various facts from the theory of globally hyperbolic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitational waves from cosmological horizon radiation during de Sitter period: as zero-order approximation of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the event horizon of the de Sitter universe can produce particles, and one can get sizable Hawking radiation by considering inflationary phases as de Sitter spacetimes with large Hubble rates. In this compact paper, we consider the graviton emission part of these radiations and assume that these graviton signals can exist in the current universe in the form of gravitational waves. We predict an energy density parameter of $\log_{10}(\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2) \sim \mathscr{O}(-25) - \mathscr{O}(-30)$ and its associated peak frequency $\log_{10}(f_{\rm peak}^0) \sim \mathscr{O}(6)-\mathscr{O}(5)$, depending on the reheating temperature. These signals occupy a frequency band below the ultrahigh-frequency regime and possess a detectable energy density, offering a promising target for future gravitational wave observatories. We believe that the detection of such signals would provide a compelling test of Hawking's radiation theory in a cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Atemporality from Conservation Laws of Physics in Lorentzian-Euclidean Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results have shown that singularities can be avoided from the general relativistic standpoint in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes by means of the transition from a Lorentzian to an Euclidean region where time loses its physical meaning and becomes imaginary. This dynamical mechanism, dubbed ``atemporality'', prevents the emergence of black hole singularities and the violation of conservation laws. In this paper, the notion of atemporality together with a detailed discussion of its implications is presented from a philosophical perspective. The main result consists in showing that atemporality is naturally related to conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Enhancing gravitational-wave detection: a machine learning pipeline combination approach with robust uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave data from advanced-era interferometric detectors consists of background Gaussian noise, frequent transient artefacts, and rare astrophysical signals. Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals from compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates interpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines results from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we demonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3, enhancing confidence in multi-pipeline detections, such as the sub-threshold binary neutron star candidate GW200311_103121.</description>

      <title>Geodesic causality in Kerr spacetimes with $|a|\geq M$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytic extension of the Kerr spacetimes into the negative radial region contains closed causal curves for any non-zero rotation parameter $a$ and mass parameter $M$. Furthermore, the spacetimes become totally vicious when $|a|&gt;M$, meaning that through every point there exists a closed timelike curve. Despite this, we prove that the Kerr spacetimes do not admit any closed null geodesics when $|a|\geq M$. This result generalises recent findings by one of the authors, which showed the nonexistence of closed causal geodesics in the case $|a|&lt;M$. Combining these results, we establish the absence of closed null geodesics in Kerr spacetimes for any non-zero $a$.</description>

      <title>Extended Scalar Particle Solutions in Black String Spacetimes with Anisotropic Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle in a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid surrounded by a cloud of strings, extending the analysis presented in our previous work. These novel solutions are dependent on the quintessence state parameter, $\alpha_{Q}$, and are now valid for a much larger domain of the radial coordinate. We investigate the cases when $\alpha_{Q} = 0,\,1/2,\,1$, encompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. We express the resulting radial wave functions using the confluent and biconfluent Heun functions, with special cases represented by Bessel functions. We derive restrictions on the allowed quantum energy levels by imposing constraints on the Heun parameters to ensure polynomial solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the emergence of "dark phases" associated with the radial wave function, focusing on the interesting case of $\alpha_{Q} = 1$. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and the potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Long-term stable nonlinear evolutions of ultracompact black-hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of ultracompact boson stars admitting light rings combining a perturbative analysis with 3+1 numerical-relativity simulations with and without symmetry assumptions. We observe excellent agreement between all perturbative and numerical results which uniformly support the hypothesis that this family of black-hole mimickers is separated into stable and unstable branches by extremal-mass configurations. This separation includes, in particular, thin-shell boson stars with light rings located on the stable branch which we conclude to represent long-term stable black-hole mimickers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constant-roll inflation is a distinctive class of phenomenological inflationary models in which the inflaton's rate of roll remains constant. It provides an exact solution that is compatible with the latest observational constraints and offers a natural framework for enhancing the curvature power spectrum, which is relevant to the formation of primordial black holes. In this paper, I review constant-roll inflation in memory of Alexei Starobinsky.</description>

      <title>A Nonperturbative Toolkit for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for demonstrating equivalences beyond the saddlepoint approximation between quantities in quantum gravity that are defined by the Euclidean path integral, without assumptions about holographic duality. The method involves three ingredients: (1) a way of resolving the identity with an overcomplete basis of microstates that is under semiclassical control, (2) a drastic simplification of the sum over topologies in the limit where the basis is infinitely overcomplete, and (3) a way of cutting and splicing geometries to demonstrate equality between two different gravitational path integrals even if neither can be explicitly computed. We illustrate our methods by giving a general argument that the thermal partition function of quantum gravity with two boundaries factorises. One implication of our results is that universes containing a horizon can sometimes be understood as superpositions of horizonless geometries entangled with a closed universe.</description>

      <title>Line-of-Sight Velocity Projection Impact on the Local Group Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass of the Local Group (LG), comprising the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31), and their satellites, is crucial for validating galaxy formation and cosmological models. Traditional virial mass estimates, which rely on line-of-sight (LoS) velocities and simplified infall assumptions, are prone to systematic biases due to unobserved velocity components and anisotropic kinematics. Using the TNG cosmological simulation, we examine two limiting cases: the \underline{minor infall} model -- ignoring perpendicular velocities to the LoS directions) and the \underline{major infall} model -- assuming purely radial motion towards the Center of Mass (CoM). Our simulations demonstrate that geometric corrections are vital: the minor-infall model underestimates the true mass, while the major-infall model overestimates it. By applying these calibrated corrections to observed dwarf galaxy kinematics within 1 Mpc of the LG's CoM, we derive a refined LG mass of $M_{\mathrm{LG}} = (2.99 \pm 0.60) \times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. This finding aligns with predictions from the $\Lambda$CDM model, timing arguments, and independent mass estimates, resolving previous discrepancies. Our analysis highlights the importance of correcting for velocity anisotropy and offers a robust framework for dynamical mass estimation in galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Black hole-accretion disk collision in general relativity: Axisymmetric simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent discoveries of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions, we revisit the collision of a black hole and an accretion disk. Assuming that they are orbiting a supermassive black hole in orthogonal orbits, we perform a general relativistic simulation of the collision, varying the relative velocity $V_0$ from $0.032c$ to $0.2c$ (where $c$ is the speed of light) with a variety of disk thickness and a realistic local density profile for the disk. Our findings indicate that the mass of the outflow matter from the disk, $m_{\rm ej}$, is slightly less than the expected value. Meanwhile, the typical energy associated with this outflow $E_{\rm ej}$ is $\sim m_{\rm ej}V_0^2$. Thus, the predicted peak luminosity from disk flares is approximately equal to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, whereas the peak time and duration of the flares, which are $\propto m_{\rm ej}^{1/2}$, are shorter than that previously believed. We also demonstrate that the property of the outflow matter induced by the incoming and outgoing stages of the black hole collision is appreciably different. We find that a high mass accretion rate onto the black hole from the disk persists for a timescale of $\sim 10^6$ Schwarzschild time of the black hole after the collision for $V_0/c \lesssim 0.1$, making this long-term accretion onto the black hole the dominant emission process for black hole-disk collision events. Implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Rotating axionic AdS$_4$ black hole dressed with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new four-dimensional axionic-charged rotating black hole with a scalar field, which is defined by a structural function coupling the axionic field and a scalar potential. This configuration is characterized by an integration constant and two parameters. The thermodynamic parameters are obtained via the Euclidean procedure, where the validity of the first law of thermodynamics is ensured. With the above information, we can see that this rotating configuration is a good laboratory from the perspective of the holographic superconductor, in which the angular parameter plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a baryogenesis mechanism originating from the theory of causal fermion systems, we analyze its main geometric and analytic features in conformally flat spacetimes. An explicit formula is derived for the rate of baryogenesis in these spacetimes, which depends on the mass $m$ of the particles, the conformal factor $\Omega$ and a future directed timelike vector field $u$ (dubbed the regularizing vector field). Our analysis covers Friedmann-Lema{\^i}tre-Robertson-Walker, Milne and Milne-like spacetimes. It sets the ground for concrete, quantitative predictions for specific cosmological spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Prospective sensitivity of CTA on detection of evaporating primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTA to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r&gt;9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r&gt;2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger standard-siren cosmology for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: Considering observations of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees.</description>

      <title>Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from Weak to Strong Backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \textit{Pure Natural Inflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom therein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field values, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\'{a}-vis CMB observations than the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI). We show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the rolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production, invariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on the background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of both scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations may lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in ArXiv[2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in AdS5 where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.</description>

Abstract: The longstanding issue of general covariance in effective models of quantum gravity is addressed, which arises when canonical quantum gravity leads to a semiclassical model described by an effective Hamiltonian constraint. In the context of spherically symmetric models, general covariance is precisely formulated into a set of equations, leading to the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring covariance. With the aid of these conditions, we derive the equations for the effective Hamiltonian constraint. The equations yield two candidates for effective Hamiltonian constraints dependent on a quantum parameter. The resulting quantum modified black hole spacetimes are analyzed. Our models show improvement by casting off the known limitations of previous works with similar results.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases due to waveform mismodeling in parametrized post-Einsteinian tests of general relativity: The impact of neglecting spin precession and higher modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the robustness of parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) tests of General Relativity (GR) with gravitational waves, due to waveform inaccuracy. In particular, we determine the properties of the signal -- signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters -- such that we are led to falsely identify a ppE deviation in the post-Newtonian (PN) inspiral phase at -1PN, 1PN, or 2PN order, due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the ppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE parameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE model. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we connect various measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that apply to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes may have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity if the running of the gravitational constant coupling happens at low energies. Particularly, they should be more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter hypothesis by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. We selected the smallest values measured when the disk was in high/soft state, made them homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth, and compared with the expectations of the Kerr metric. We do not find any significant deviation. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases.</description>

      <title>Overtones and Nonlinearities in Binary Black Hole Ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using high-accuracy numerical relativity waveforms, we confirm the presence of numerous overtones of the $\ell=2$, $m=2$ quasinormal mode early in the ringdown of binary black hole mergers. We do this by demonstrating the stability of the mode amplitudes at different fit times, ruling out the possibility that a linear superposition of modes unphysically fits a highly nonlinear part of the waveform. We also find a number of previously unidentified subdominant second-order quasinormal modes in the $(2,2)$ mode. Even though these modes are mathematically nonlinear, they nevertheless confirm the validity of perturbation theory as a good approximation for describing much of the ringdown.</description>

      <title>The scalar angular Teukolsky equation and its solution for the Taub-NUT spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taub-NUT spacetime offers many curious insights into the solutions of Einstein's electrovacuum equation. In the Bonnor interpretation, this spacetime possesses so-called Misner strings, which induce phenomena strikingly analogous to Dirac strings in the context of magnetic monopoles. The study of scattering in the latter case leads to a quantization of the product of electric charge and magnetic moment, sometimes called the Dirac condition. To enable a thorough discussion of scattering on the Taub-NUT spacetime, linear perturbations are considered in the Newman-Penrose formalism and separated into angular and radial equations. The angular Teukolsky equation is discussed in detail, and eigenvalues are derived to subsequently solve the differential equation in terms of solutions to the confluent Heun equation. In the Bonnor interpretation of the Taub-NUT spacetime, there is no analog property to the Dirac condition. The choice of spacetime parameters remains unconstrained. However, for a particular parameter choice, one can rederive the well-known \enquote{Misner} condition, in which a product of frequency and NUT charge is of integer value, as well as another product additionally including the Manko-Ruiz parameter. The results of this work will allow us to solve analytically for wave-optical scattering in order to, e.g., examine the wave-optical image of Taub-NUT black holes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic Microwave Background analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the CMB. This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB. After providing analytic estimates of the transmission functions, we show that the covariance matrix in frequency space becomes very non-diagonal. We then build formally the quadratic estimator for the HD correlation in multipolar space, for both a perfect experiment, and for a realistic pulsar noise model. For a perfect experiment, we show that the SNR grows with the observation time and the number of frequency bins, in turn determined by the cadence of observation. For an imperfect experiment, the behaviour is similar, with an effective multipole-dependent number of frequency, obtained after weighting with noise. We predict that with $\sim 200$ pulsars monitored for $25$ years, multipoles of the HD correlation up to $\ell=4$ can be measured. Our findings clarify that is called \emph{cosmic variance} in previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, with optimal estimators, it can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation. We also discuss the case in which the graviton distribution function is anisotropic.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with Skyrme Lyon (SLy)/Brussels-Montreal Skyrme functionals (BSk) class equations of state (EOSs), along with the M\"uller-Serot (MS2) EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

Abstract: Exact plane gravitational radiation fields are presented within the framework of general relativity and their properties are described. The physics of nonlinear elliptically polarized plane gravitational waves is developed in close analogy with electromagnetic waves. The motion of free test particles in the dynamic gravitational fields of elliptically polarized plane waves is investigated. In particular, we demonstrate the cosmic jet property of these spacetimes, namely, most timelike geodesics tend to line up in the direction of wave propagation and produce a cosmic jet whose speed asymptotically approaches the speed of light.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Ringing and Shadows of Black Holes and Wormholes in Dark Matter-Inspired Weyl Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl gravity naturally generates effective dark matter and cosmological constant terms as integration constants, eliminating the need to explicitly introduce them into the theory. Additionally, the framework permits three intriguing solutions for compact objects: an asymptotically de Sitter Schwarzschild-like black hole described by the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, a non-Schwarzschild black hole, and a traversable wormhole that exists without exotic matter. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal spectra of all three solutions.
  We demonstrate that when the mass of the black hole corresponding to the Mannheim-Kazanas solution approaches zero, the perturbation equations yield an exact solution expressible through hypergeometric functions. The quasinormal modes of black holes in Weyl gravity can be classified into three distinct branches: Schwarzschild-like modes modified by effective dark matter and cosmological terms, and modes associated with empty spacetime (de Sitter and dark matter branches), which are further influenced by the black hole mass. Previous studies have shown that the dark matter term induces a secondary stage of quasinormal ringing following the initial Schwarzschild phase. Here, we compute the frequencies using convergent methods and elucidate how this unique time-domain behavior translates into the frequency domain.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the non-Schwarzschild black hole can be distinguished from both the Schwarzschild-like solution and the wormhole through their distinct quasinormal spectra. We also compute shadow radii for black holes and wormholes within Weyl gravity, revealing that wormholes with large throat radii can produce significantly smaller shadows compared to black holes of equivalent mass.</description>

      <title>The observation image of a soliton boson star illuminated by various accretions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the observable signatures of solitonic boson stars by employing ray-tracing simulations, with celestial spheres and thin accretion disks serving as illumination sources. By numerically fitting the metric form, we solve the geodesic equation for photons under the influence of the soliton potential, enabling us to simulate the optical appearance of the soliton boson star in two distinct regimes. In the weak coupling case (larger value of coupling parameter $\alpha$) with an initial scalar field $\psi_0$, the images on the screen predominantly show direct and lensed images, where $\psi_0$ and $\alpha$ modulate the image region size while the observation inclination $\theta$ controls morphological asymmetry. In the case of strong coupling (small value of $\alpha$), the images on the screen show a nested sub-annulus within the Einstein ring in the celestial model, whereas thin disk accretion models reveal higher-order lensing images indicative that photons are capable of orbiting the equatorial plane of the boson star multiple times. We also analyze how the effective potential and redshift factor depend on the correlation parameter. At low inclination($\theta&lt;30^{\circ})$, the redshift is the dominant effect, the image is characterized by a dim central cavity enclosed by a bright ring. At high inclination ($\theta&gt;60^{\circ})$, the Doppler effect becomes more pronounced, resulting in a substantial brightness disparity between the left and right sides of the optical image. These findings offer robust theoretical underpinnings for differentiating solitonic boson stars from black holes via high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics - based on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic lensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Generalized Entropy onto Bardeen Black Hole Surrounded by Cloud of Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic characteristics and geothermodynamics of a Bardeen black hole (BH) that interacts with a string cloud and is minimally connected to nonlinear electrodynamics. To avoid the singularities throughout the cosmic evolution, we consider an entropy function which comprises five parameters. In addition, by employing this entropy function for the specific range of parameters, we obtain the representations of BH entropy based on the holographic principle. Moreover, we employ this entropy function to investigate its impact on the thermodynamics of the BH by studying various thermodynamic properties like mass, temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy for numerous scalar charge and string cloud values. To support our investigation, we use various geothermodynamics formalisms to evaluate the stable behavior and identify different physical scenarios. Furthermore, in this analysis, we observe that only one entropy formalism provides us with better results regarding the thermodynamic behavior of the BH. Moreover, it is shown that one of the entropy models provides a thermodynamic geometric behavior compared to the other entropy models.</description>

Abstract: We explore the gravitational baryogenesis paradigm in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of generalized coupling gravity and, in particular, of the so-called Minimal Exponential Measure Model (MEMe). We show that, also in this theory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents and can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal equilibrium. Using the current bounds on the ratio of baryon number to entropy density, we can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q that characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw stringent constraints on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background, which play a crucial role in the field's dynamics. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [2].</description>

      <title>Wave map null form estimates via Peter-Weyl theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spacetime estimates for the wave map null form $Q_0$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. By using the Lie group structure of $\mathbb{S}^3$ and Peter-Weyl theory, combined with the time-periodicity of the conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we extend the classical ideas of Klainerman and Machedon to estimates on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, allowing for a range of powers of natural (Laplacian and wave) Fourier multiplier operators. A key difference in these curved space estimates as compared to the flat case is a loss of an arbitrarily small amount of differentiability, attributable to a lack of dispersion of linear waves on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This arises in Fourier space from the product structure of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We further show that our estimates imply weighted estimates for the null form on Minkowski space.</description>

Abstract: Soft graviton theorems receive one-loop contributions that are logarithmic in the energy of the soft graviton, and which are closely related to tails of gravitational waveforms. We demonstrate that these logarithmic corrections are encoded in the Ward identity of superrotation symmetries, i.e. they follow from conservation of superrotation charge across spatial infinity $i^0$. Our proof relies on a careful analysis of the radiative phase space admitting such gravitational tails, and the determination of the fluxes through null infinity $\mathscr I$ that act as canonical generators of superrotations on both gravitational and matter fields. All logarithmic terms are derived from the fluxes through correlations of the supertranslation Goldstone mode, provided care is taken in manipulating gravitationally interacting (i.e. dressed) rather than free fields. In cases where massive particles take part in the scattering process, logarithmic corrections also partly arise from the superrotation charge generator at timelike infinity $i^\pm$.</description>

      <title>Gauging spacetime inversions in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetime inversion symmetries such as parity and time reversal play a central role in physics, but they are usually treated as global symmetries. In quantum gravity there are no global symmetries, so any spacetime inversion symmetries must be gauge symmetries. In particular this includes $\mathcal{CRT}$ symmetry (in even dimensions usually combined with a rotation to become $\mathcal{CPT}$), which in quantum field theory is always a symmetry and seems likely to be a symmetry of quantum gravity as well. In this article we discuss what it means to gauge a spacetime inversion symmetry, and we explain some of the more unusual consequences of doing this. In particular we argue that the gauging of $\mathcal{CRT}$ is automatically implemented by the sum over topologies in the Euclidean gravity path integral, that in a closed universe the Hilbert space of quantum gravity must be a real vector space, and that in Lorentzian signature manifolds which are not time-orientable must be included as valid configurations of the theory. In particular we give an example of an asymptotically-AdS time-unorientable geometry which must be included to reproduce computable results in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Beyond GWTC-3: Analysing and verifying new gravitational-wave events from community catalogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The public release of data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors has enabled the identification of potential gravitational wave signals by independent teams using alternative methodologies. In addition to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration's GWTC-3 catalogue there have been several additional works claiming the detection of signals in the data from the first three observing runs. In this paper we present an analysis of these new signals using the same analysis workflow which was used to generate the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 catalogues published by the LVK, matching the analysis configuration as closely as possible, and we provide our parameter estimation results in a format comparable to those of the GWTC-3 data release. We also include a discussion of the workflow developed for this analysis.</description>

      <title>Identification is Pointless: Quantum Coordinates, Localisation of Events, and the Quantum Hole Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum reference frames (QRFs) is motivated by the idea of taking into account the quantum properties of the reference frames used, explicitly or implicitly, in our description of physical systems. Like classical reference frames, QRFs can be used to define physical quantities relationally. Unlike their classical analogue, they relativise the notions of superposition and entanglement. Here, we explain this feature by examining how configurations or locations are identified across different branches in superposition. We show that, in the presence of symmetries, whether a system is in "the same" or "different" configurations across the branches depends on the choice of QRF. Hence, sameness and difference -- and thus superposition and entanglement -- lose their absolute meaning. We apply these ideas to the context of semi-classical spacetimes in superposition and use coincidences of four scalar fields to construct a comparison map between spacetime points in the different branches. This reveals that the localisation of an event is frame-dependent. We discuss the implications for indefinite causal order and the locality of interaction and conclude with a generalisation of Einstein's hole argument to the quantum context.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation beyond slow roll: noise modelling and importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the distribution of very rare, large excursions in the primordial density field produced in models of inflation in the very early universe which include a strong enhancement of the power spectrum. The stochastic $\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is used to identify the probability distribution for the primordial curvature perturbation with the first-passage-time distribution, $P(\delta \mathcal{N})$, and we compare our stochastic results with those obtained in the classical $\delta \mathcal{N}$ approach. We extend the PyFPT numerical code to simulate the full 2D phase space, and apply importance sampling which allows very rare fluctuations to be simulated in $\mathcal{O}(10)$ minutes on a single CPU, where previous direct simulations required supercomputers. We demonstrate that the stochastic noise due to quantum fluctuations after a sudden transition to ultra-slow roll can be accurately modelled using an analytical Bessel-function ansatz to identify the homogeneous growing mode. The stochastic noise found in this way is a function of the field value only. This enables us to coarse grain the inflation field at the Hubble scale and include non-linear, stochastic evolution on all super-Hubble length scales.</description>

      <title>Modulations of Gravitational Waves due to Non-static Gravitational Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a new observational window into the universe, providing insights into compact objects and cosmic structures. Gravitational lensing, commonly studied in electromagnetic waves, also affects GWs, introducing magnification, time delays, and multiple images. While existing studies focus on static lenses, many astrophysical lenses are dynamic, with time-varying mass distributions such as moving stars or orbiting binaries. We develop a general theoretical framework to describe non-static lenses and demonstrate how they modulate GW signals, inducing unique time-varying amplitude modulations and spectral broadening. By examining uniformly moving and orbiting binary lenses, we show that these modulations provide new observational signatures, enhancing our understanding of lensing objects and the dynamics of the universe. Our findings have important implications for GW astronomy, offering novel ways to probe lens dynamics and improve the interpretations of GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on hilltop quintessence scenarios, able to satisfy theoretical constraints from quantum gravity. We discuss their realisation based on axions, their supersymmetric partners, and Higgs-like string constructions, including dynamical mechanisms to set up initial conditions at the hilltops. We also examine a specific parameterisation for dynamical dark energy suitable for hilltop quintessence. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature. However, all these constraints are sensitive to priors based on theoretical assumptions about viable regions of parameter space. Consequently, we discuss theoretical challenges in refining these priors, with the aim of maximizing the informative power of current and forthcoming cosmological datasets for testing dark energy scenarios in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of QFT in non-inertial frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some aspects of quantum field theory in a general (i.e. non inertial) frame of Minkowski spacetime are studied. Conditions for the presence of horizons as well as for the modification of the definition of positive energy solutions are examined. The standard wisdom is confirmed that none of these phenomena is generic. This corroborates that in the general case there is no natural way to define positive frequencies, which is the standard road to define particles. In that sense, (as well as in others) non inertial frames are similar to curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Pantheon+ supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ Maximum Likelihood Estimators to examine the Pantheon+ catalogue of Type Ia supernovae for large scale anisotropies in the expansion rate of the Universe. The analyses are carried out in the heliocentric frame, the CMB frame, as well as the Local Group frame. In all frames, the Hubble expansion rate in the redshift range 0.023 &lt; z &lt; 0.15 is found to have a statistically significant dipolar variation exceeding 1.5 km/s/Mpc, i.e. bigger than the claimed 1% uncertainty in the SH0ES measurement of the Hubble parameter H_0. The deceleration parameter too has a redshift-dependent dipolar modulation at &gt; 5 sigma significance, consistent with previous findings using the SDSSII/SNLS3 Joint Lightcurve Analysis catalogue. The inferred cosmic acceleration cannot therefore be due to a Cosmological Constant, but is likely a general relativistic effect due to the anomalous bulk flow in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $2\times10^{16}$ - $5\times10^{17}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Our results indicate that although Insight-HXMT does not have an advantage in the first two scenarios, when considering the power-law model, its exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray regime and sufficiently high upper energy limit significantly strengthen the constraints on PBHs with masses greater than $10^{17}$ g compared to previous limits. Furthermore, the exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter has reached $4\times10^{17}$ g, which is comparable to the current threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we reported the presence of a new resonance of an incompressible star orbiting a spinning black hole and showed that it can set in before the tidal disruption limit if the star has an inclined spherical orbit around the black hole. Using the affine model developed by Carter and Luminet, we extend our result to the stars with polytropic equations of state. We give further credence to the result previously given. We also derive the formula for the growth rate of the resonant motion, which is useful for checking the results of hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent data from DESI, in combination with other data, provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w&lt;-1$, at redshift $z\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. Thus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other physically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence to the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data as well as $w_0, w_a$ in a flat background, based on both parametric and realistic scalar field evolutions. Although the realistic model does not allow $w&lt;-1$, the parametrizations do allow it. However even if we allow $w&lt;-1$ the data do not enforce phantom crossing. Thus, the phantom crossing is an artifact of a parametrization that is not based on a physical model.</description>

      <title>More on genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</description>
