      <title>Pion Valence Quark Distribution at Physical Pion mass of $N_f=2+1+1$ Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art calculation of the unpolarized pion valence-quark distribution in the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) with improved handling of systematic errors as well as two-loop perturbative matching. We use lattice ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration at lattice spacing $a\approx 0.09$~fm, lattice volume $64^3\times 96$, $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of highly-improved staggered quarks and a physical pion mass. The LaMET matrix elements are calculated with pions boosted to momentum $P_z\approx 1.72$~GeV with high-statistics of $O(10^6)$ measurements. We study the pion PDF in both hybrid-ratio and hybrid-regularization-independent momentum subtraction (hybrid-RI/MOM) schemes and also compare the systematic errors with and without the addition of leading-renormalon resummation (LRR) and renormalization-group resummation (RGR) in both the renormalization and lightcone matching. The final lightcone PDF results are presented in the modified minimal-subtraction scheme at renormalization scale $\mu=2.0$~GeV. We show that the $x$-dependent PDFs are compatible between the hybrid-ratio and hybrid-RI/MOM renormalization with the same improvements. We also show that systematics are greatly reduced by the simultaneous inclusion of RGR and LRR and that these methods are necessary if improved precision is to be reached with higher-order terms in renormalization and matching.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation for Spectroscopy of Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note discusses a method for computing the energy spectra of quantum field theory utilizing digital quantum simulation. A quantum algorithm, called coherent imaging spectroscopy, quenches the vacuum with a time-oscillating perturbation and then reads off the excited energy levels from the loss in the vacuum-to-vacuum probability following the quench. As a practical demonstration, we apply this algorithm to the (1+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with a topological term known as the Schwinger model, where the conventional Monte Carlo approach is practically inaccessible. In particular, on a classical simulator, we prepare the vacuum of the Schwinger model on a lattice by adiabatic state preparation and then apply various types of quenches to the approximate vacuum through Suzuki-Trotter time evolution. We discuss the dependence of the simulation results on the specific types of quenches and introduce various consistency checks, including the exact diagonalization and the continuum limit extrapolation. The estimation of the computational complexity required to obtain physically reasonable results implies that the method is likely efficient in the coming era of early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation of minimal holographic sparsified SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and quartic interactions which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k = 8.7 \ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms per $N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{5}$ two-qubit or Clifford+$T$-gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model.</description>

      <title>Chiral-vacuum excited replicae in QCD modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) gap equation ``replicae'' or excited vacuum states, orthogonal to the ground-state one, in the chiral-quark sector of the Hamiltonian Coulomb-gauge model of chromodynamics. Analyzing the number of negative eigenmodes of the energy density's Hessian we believe that we have identified all of the (negative energy-density) vacua of this nonlinear system, namely the ground BCS state and two (or one) replicae for slightly massive (or massless) quarks, given the interaction strength typical of the strong interactions. The meson spectrum over each of the replicae looks similar, so the differences are not significant enough given model uncertainties, but matrix elements are more sensitive and allow to distinguish them. We propose to look for such excited vacua in lattice gauge theory by trying to identify excitations with scalar quantum numbers which have energies proportional to the lattice volume (unlike conventional mesons for which the mass stabilizes to a constant upon taking the infinite volume limit).</description>

      <title>Identifying phase transitions in physical systems with neural networks: a neural architecture search perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning algorithms to investigate phase transitions in physical systems is a valuable way to better understand the characteristics of these systems. Neural networks have been used to extract information of phases and phase transitions directly from many-body configurations. However, one limitation of neural networks is that they require the definition of the model architecture and parameters previous to their application, and such determination is itself a difficult problem. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the relationship between the accuracy of neural networks for information of phases and the network configuration (that comprises the architecture and hyperparameters). We formulate the phase analysis as a regression task, address the question of generating data that reflects the different states of the physical system, and evaluate the performance of neural architecture search for this task. After obtaining the optimized architectures, we further implement smart data processing and analytics by means of neuron coverage metrics, assessing the capability of these metrics to estimate phase transitions. Our results identify the neuron coverage metric as promising for detecting phase transitions in physical systems.</description>

      <title>D Pi scattering and D meson resonances from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:1208.4059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses and widths of the broad scalar D_0^*(2400) and the axial D_1(2430) charmed-light resonances are extracted by simulating the corresponding D Pi and D* Pi scattering on the lattice. The resonance parameters are obtained using a Breit-Wigner fit of the elastic phase shifts. The resulting D_0^*(2400) mass is 351+/-21 MeV above the spin-average 1/4(m_D+3m_{D*}), in agreement with the experimental value of 347+/-29 MeV above. The resulting D_0^* to D Pi coupling g^{lat}=2.55+/-0.21 GeV is close to the experimental value g^{exp}&lt;=1.92+/-0.14 GeV, where g parametrizes the width $\Gamma\equiv g^2p^*/s$. The resonance parameters for the broad D_1(2430) are also found close to the experimental values; these are obtained by appealing to the heavy quark limit, where the neighboring resonance D_1(2420) is narrow. The calculated I=1/2 scattering lengths are a_0=0.81+/-0.14 fm for D Pi and a_0=0.81+/-0.17 fm for D* Pi scattering. The simulation of the scattering in these channels incorporates quark-antiquark as well as multi-hadron interpolators, and the distillation method is used for contractions. In addition, the ground and several excited charm-light and charmonium states with various J^P are calculated using standard quark-antiquark interpolators. Our simulations are done in lattice QCD with two-dynamical light quarks at a mass corresponding to m_\pi\approx 266 MeV.</description>

      <title>Remnants of quark model in lattice QCD simulation in the Coulomb gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming at the relation between QCD and the quark model, we consider projections of gauge configurations generated in quenched lattice QCD simulations in the Coulomb gauge on a 16$^{\rm 3}$ $\rm \times$ 32, $\rm \beta$ = 6.0 lattice. First, we focus on a fact that the static quark-antiquark potential is independent of spatial gauge fields. We explicitly confirm this by performing $\vec{A}$ = 0 projection, where spatial gauge fields are all set to zero. We also apply the $\vec{A}$ = 0 projection to light hadron masses and find that nucleon and delta baryon masses are almost degenerate, suggesting vanishing of the color-magnetic interactions. After considering the physical meaning of the $\vec{A}$ = 0 projection, we next propose a generalized projection, where spatial gauge fields are expanded in terms of Faddeev-Popov eigenmodes and only some eigenmodes are left. We apply the proposed projection to light hadron and glueball masses and find that the N-$\rm \Delta$ and 0$^{\rm ++}$-2$^{\rm ++}$ mass splittings become evident when projected with more than 33 (0.10 \%) low-lying eigenmodes, suggesting emergence of the color-magnetic interactions. We also find that the original hadron masses are approximately reproduced with just 328 (1.00 \%) low-lying eigenmodes. These findings indicate an important role of low-lying eigenmodes on hadron masses and would be useful in clarifying the relation between QCD and the quark model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While neutrino oscillations have led to attention and research on field mixing arising from quadratic interactions, the field mixing inherent in clothed particles is more fundamental, serving as a significant source of complexity and non-perturbative challenges in quantum field theory. We present an example of an analytical solution for field mixing involving a three-point interaction between a bosonic field and a fermionic field. Specifically, we study the Rothe-Stamatescu (RS) model and utilize lattice regularization to provide a well-defined Hamiltonian which is absent in the original continuous RS model. Due to the complexity introduced by three-point interactions compared to quadratic interactions, the Fock representation commonly used in discussions of field mixing does not work well; instead, we define a representation based on real space to investigate the physical vacuum and clothed particles. These eigenstates not only reveal the field mixing between the bosonic and fermionic fields but also allow us to directly observe the spatial entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>Dually weighted multi-matrix models as a path to causal gravity-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dually-weighted multi-matrix model that for a suitable choice of weights reproduce two-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) coupled to the Ising model. When Ising degrees of freedom are removed, this model corresponds to the CDT-matrix model introduced by Benedetti and Henson [Phys. Lett. B 678, 222 (2009)]. We present exact as well as approximate results for the Gaussian averages of characters of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and $A^2$ for a given representation and establish the present limitations that prevent us to solve the model analytically. This sets the stage for the formulation of more sophisticated matter models coupled to two-dimensional CDT as dually weighted multi-matrix models providing a complementary view to the standard simplicial formulation of CDT-matter models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dependence of the neutral pion longitudinal screening mass in the linear sigma model with quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the linear sigma model with quarks to study the magnetic-field-induced modifications on the longitudinal screening mass for the neutral pion at one-loop level. The effects of the magnetic field are introduced into the self-energy, which contains the contributions from all the model particles. We find that, to obtain a reasonable description for the behavior with the field strength, we need to account for the magnetic field dependence of the particle masses. We also find that the couplings need to decrease fast enough with the field strength to then reach constant and smaller values as compared to their vacuum ones. The results illustrate the need to treat the magnetic corrections to the particle masses and couplings in a self-consistent manner, accounting for the backreaction of the field effects for the magnetic field dependence of the rest of the particle species and couplings in the model.</description>

      <title>QCD with an Infrared Fixed Point and a Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following previous work we further explore the possibility that the chirally broken phase of gauge theories admits an infrared fixed point interpretation. The slope of the $\beta$ function, $\beta'_*$, is found to vanish at the infrared fixed point which has several attractive features such as logarithmic running. We provide a more in-depth analysis of our previous result that the mass anomalous assumes $\gamma_* = 1$ at the fixed point. The results are found to be consistent with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In a second part the specific properties of a dilaton, the (pseudo) Goldstone, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated. Dilaton soft theorems indicate that a soft dilaton mass can only originate from an operator of scaling dimension two. In the gauge theory this role is taken on by the $\bar qq$-operator. The QCD dilaton candidate, the $\sigma = f_0(500)$ meson is investigated. Singlet-octet mixing is found to be important. We briefly discuss the dilaton as a candidate for the Higgs boson, which relies on the ratio of dilaton to pion decay constant being close to unity. In QCD this is approximately satisfied but it is remains unclear if this is accidental or whether there is unknown reason behind it.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the Pseudoscalar Meson Octet and the Baryon Decuplet in the Continuum and a Finite Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the interaction of the pseudoscalar meson octet and the baryon decuplet. In the continuum, it is observed that several $J^{P}=\frac32^-$ baryon resonances can be produced by the Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction in unitarized chiral perturbation theory, including the $N(1875)$, $\Sigma(1670)$, $\Sigma(1910)$, $\Xi(1820)$ and $\Omega(2012)$. Among them, the $\Xi(1820)$ and $\Sigma(1670)$ may exhibit a potential two-pole structures. The unitarized chiral perturbation approach is then applied as the underlying theory to predict the energy levels of these systems in a finite volume. These energy levels are well described by the $K$-matrix parameterization constrained by flavor SU(3) symmetry. With the parameters from the best fits, the poles extracted from the $K$-matrix parameterization closely correspond to those derived from the underlying chiral effective field theory, as long as they are close to physical region and not significantly higher than the lowest relevant threshold.</description>

      <title>Semiclassics for the QCD vacuum structure through $T^2$-compactification with the baryon-'t Hooft flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study QCD vacuum structure with the topological $\theta$ angle using a recently proposed semiclassical approach on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times T^2$ with the 't Hooft and baryon magnetic fluxes. Under the assumption of adiabatic continuity in this setup, the confining vacuum can be described by the dilute gas of center vortices. With this semiclassical approach, we derive the 2d effective description at small $T^2$ and successfully explain the reasonable theta dependence of the QCD vacuum: In the one-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$, the $CP$ symmetry is spontaneously broken for quark mass above a critical value and restored for a subcritical mass, while the $CP$ symmetry is always spontaneously broken in the multi-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$. From our semiclassical description, we discuss implications to the $4$d chiral Lagrangian and propose how the $\eta'$ meson should be incorporated in consistent with known global structures: The periodicity of the $\eta'$ should be extended from the naive one $2\pi$ to $2\pi N$. Additionally, we revisit the phase diagram of $N_f = 1+1$ and $N_f = 1+1+1$ QCD on the up and down quark mass plane, confirming and refining the existence of the $CP$-broken Dashen phase.</description>

Abstract: I review and improve on how two-index SU(N) gauge-fermion theories help access salient information about the large $N$ vacuum and spectrum of QCD, super Yang Mills and meson-meson scattering. The interplay with recent lattice simulations will be employed to deduce the size of $1/N^2$ corrections. Through the meson-meson scattering analysis I will honor Steven Weinberg's memory by showing how two-index extrapolations naturally accommodate the appearance of tetraquarks states crucial to unitarize meson-meson scattering at low energies.</description>

Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) describes the long distance behavior of certain confining, near-conformal gauge theories that have been studied via lattice computation. Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), emerging from the breaking of approximate, continuous, internal symmetries, are coupled to an additional scalar particle, the dilaton, arising from the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This effective theory has been employed to study possible extensions of the standard model. In this paper, we propose a complementary role for dEFT, as a description of the dark matter of the universe, with the pNGBs identified as the dark-matter particles. We show that this theory provides a natural implementation of the ``forbidden'' dark matter mechanism, and we identify regions of parameter space for which the thermal history of dEFT yields the measured dark matter relic density.</description>
