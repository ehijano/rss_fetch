      <title>Hybrid collisional-radiative modeling for high-fidelity atomic kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fidelity of collisional-radiative (CR) models is critical for advancing our understanding of radiative properties and ionization balance in fusion plasmas. In this work, we present and evaluate hybrid CR schemes that combine fine-structure resolution with superconfiguration averaging, offering a practical compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Two hybrid CR models are developed for helium, lithium, and beryllium, retaining detailed fine-structure states up to selected principal quantum numbers, while higher-lying states are statistically averaged to form superconfigurations. These models are applied to compute radiative power loss, as well as average and effective charge states, across a wide range of electron temperatures and densities. The results are benchmarked against a fully fine-structure-resolved CR model to assess the accuracy of the hybrid approach. The findings demonstrate the versatility of hybrid CR schemes and their suitability for detailed plasma simulations where predictive fidelity must be balanced with computational cost.</description>

      <title>Plasma Decay of Nanosecond Pulsed Laser-Produced Ar and Ar-H2O Sparks at Atmospheric Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved diagnostics were applied to investigate free-electron properties in nanosecond laser-produced discharges sustained at atmospheric pressure in Ar and in Ar with 3% H2O. The discharges were generated using 23 ns, 1064 nm laser pulses. Broadband plasma imaging and laser Thomson scattering were combined with optical emission spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on Stark broadening of the Halpha and Hbeta lines. The plasma exhibited a bright emission that persisted for up to 30--40 us after breakdown, followed by a very weak glow lasting up to 19 ms. Peak electron number density of about 2 x 10^17 cm-3 and electron temperature of about 7 eV were measured. Excellent agreement between both techniques was obtained for absolute electron number densities. The inferred temporal decay of free electrons is consistent with processes dominated by ambipolar expansion and two- and three-body electron-ion recombination. These results provide benchmark data for modeling nanosecond laser discharges and demonstrate the reliability of combining Thomson scattering with Stark broadening in atmospheric laser sparks.</description>

      <title>Sub-ion scale current sheets in kinetic Alfv\'en wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed using the kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) eigenvector relations from a two-fluid model as initial conditions, in order to study turbulent fluctuations and intermittent structures at sub-ion and electron scales. Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Langmuir/$\mathcal{Z}$-mode Wave Decay into $\mathcal{Z}$-mode Electromagnetic Radiation in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear decay of Langmuir/$\mathcal{Z}$-mode waves into electromagnetic $\mathcal{Z}$-mode wave radiation at the plasma frequency is observed for the first time in the solar wind. This finding was enabled by the unprecedented high-resolution electric and magnetic field measurements provided by the Radio Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument aboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, which encountered an electron beam associated with a Type III radio burst. The decay process is definitively identified through multiple lines of evidence: satisfaction of frequency and wavevector resonance conditions, strong phase coherence and temporal coincidence between the interacting waves, exclusion of competing mechanisms, and full agreement with theoretical predictions. Particle-in-cell simulations, conducted under close beam-plasma conditions, successfully reproduce the key features of the observations. Notably, they suggest that the wave packet observed by Solar Orbiter may be trapped within an extended, nearly flat-bottomed density well, where the decay process is not overcome by wave scattering on random density fluctuations and subsequent mode conversion effects.</description>

      <title>Smooth Polar B-Splines with High-Order Regularity at the Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a smooth B-spline discretization in polar coordinates on the unit disc that corrects the loss of regularity present at the origin caused by the coordinate singularity in standard tensor-product B-spline formulations. The method constructs "smooth polar splines" via a Galerkin projection of harmonic polar functions $S_l^{-m}(r,\theta) := r^l \sin(m\theta)$ and $S_l^{m}(r,\theta) := r^l \cos(m\theta)$, derived from the polar representation of Cartesian monomials, onto the central tensor-product B-spline basis in the innermost radial region. The radial component reproduces $r^l$ exactly for $0 \le l \leq p$, where $p$ is the B-spline degree, satisfying the near-origin regularity condition. However, exact compatibility with $C^\infty$-regularity at the origin is recovered only in the limit $\Delta\theta \to 0$, when the angular component resolves all angular harmonics accurately. The smooth polar splines are linear combinations of standard tensor-product B-splines and lie in the same function space, enabling mapping between the $C^\infty$-regular subspace and the original discretization space via an exact prolongation operator and a corresponding restriction operator acting on the discrete variables. They match standard tensor-product B-splines away from the origin, preserve orthogonality among the newly constructed origin-centered basis functions, and maintain local support and sparse matrices. This smoothness and locality improve the conditioning of mass and stiffness matrices, conserve charge, and reduce statistical errors in particle-in-cell simulations near the origin, while eliminating spurious eigenvalues in eigenvalue problems. The approach provides a robust, high-order, and efficient adaptation of tensor-product B-splines for polar coordinates in physics simulations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Evolution and Current Sheet Analysis as Probes of Reconnection-Mediated Decay in Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of magnetically dominated turbulence exhibits robust inverse transfer of magnetic energy even in the absence of net magnetic helicity, challenging traditional cascade-based phenomenology. While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Spin-redirection Berry phase with planar rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric or Berry phases are fundamental manifestations that appear in many areas of physics. They arise from the geometry of the space describing the properties of multi-component wave fields. An important example for electromagnetic waves is the spin-redirection Berry phase associated with the evolution of the spin direction. Because this effect has traditionally been studied in isotropic media where the spin is aligned with the ray trajectory, it has become commonly assumed that this spin-redirection Berry phase requires nonplanar rays. Here we show that a spin-redirection phase can in fact arise along a planar ray if the spin evolves along the ray. We expose this effect through the singular example of a moving unmagnetized plasma, and demonstrate how this behavior can more generally arise from a finite transverse spin. In identifying this new spin-redirection mechanism our work not only provides the tools to discover additional manifestations of SOIs in nature, but also uncovers supplemental degrees of freedom to harness SOIs to control light.</description>

      <title>Closure models for the feedback of energetic particles on plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic particles interact with the plasma surrounding them, resonating with certain plasma waves to stabilize them while destabilizing others, and changing the character of the background turbulence in ways that have not been fully quantified or understood. Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures.</description>

      <title>Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although a full four-dimensional relativistic calculation of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ has been made, studies of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ have been focused on systems that depend on only two spatial coordinates. Three results are given: (1) A relatively simple demonstration in three dimensional space that the lines of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not reconnect when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect. (2) The guiding center motion of charged particles is modified by a term that is proportional to $(c/\omega_{pe})^2$, which is smaller than the drifts proportional to the gyroradius unless the current density is extremely large. (3) In three dimensional space, the evolution velocity of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is characteristically chaotic, which means neighboring streamlines separate exponentially on a timescale $\tau_u$. $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ undergoes large scale reconnection on a timescale that is only an order of magnitude or two longer than $\tau_u$ unless all diffusive non-ideal effects, such as resistivity, are absolutely zero.</description>

      <title>A note on thermal effects in non-linear models for plasma-based acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a non-negligible background temperature on relativistic plasma wake-fields generated when a beam of charged particles passes through a neutral plasma at rest. We focus on the blowout regime, wherein the plasma response is highly non-linear: plasma electrons are radially blown out and expelled away from the propagation axis of the beam particles, creating a region (bubble) of ions without electrons. Our study builds upon earlier investigations for non-linear models of plasma wakefields developed in the limit of zero background temperature (Lu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 165002 (2006)). In the presence of a non-zero background temperature, we characterize the model and focus on its predictions for the bubble size and the electromagnetic fields inside the bubble. Model predictions are studied in combination with PIC simulations.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of a Multicusp-Assisted Inductively-Coupled Radio-Frequency Plasma Source for Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a detailed characterisation of a multicusp-assisted inductively coupled RF plasma source for plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). Using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and RF-compensated Langmuir probe diagnostics, we measured ion temperature T i and drift velocity v z in argon plasmas near an immersed electrode. The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses. LIF-derived potential profiles match Riemann's presheath theory, and ion velocity distributions reveal acceleration consistent with sheath dynamics. These results support the use of LIF for steady-state characterisation of the bulk and presheath regions in PIII systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new electromagnetic plasma wavepacket solutions that propagates in one time and one space coordinates. Differently to the usual plane wave solution, which is written in terms of separation of variables, all our solutions are along the light-cone coordinates. This allow us to find several new solutions whose functionality properties rely on the conditions imposed on the choice for their light-cone coordinates dependence. The presented wavepacket solutions are constructed in terms of multiplications of Airy functions, Parabolic cylinder functions, Mathieu functions, or Bessel functions. We thoroughly analyze the case of a double Airy solution, which have new electromagnetic properties, as a defined wavefront, and velocity faster than the electromagnetic plane wave counterpart solution. It is also mentioned how more general structured wavepackets can be constructed from these new solutions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: The topological origin of Bohm resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta \propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (&gt; 5{\sigma}) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.</description>

Abstract: We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</description>
