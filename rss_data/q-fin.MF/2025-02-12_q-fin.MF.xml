      <title>Asymptotic Expansions for High-Frequency Option Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a nonparametric higher-order asymptotic expansion for small-time changes of conditional characteristic functions of It\^o semimartingale increments. The asymptotics setup is of joint type: both the length of the time interval of the increment of the underlying process and the time gap between evaluating the conditional characteristic function are shrinking. The spot semimartingale characteristics of the underlying process as well as their spot semimartingale characteristics appear as leading terms in the derived asymptotic expansions. The analysis applies to a general class of It\^o semimartingales that includes in particular L\'evy-driven SDEs and time-changed L\'evy processes. The asymptotic expansion results are subsequently used to construct a test for whether volatility jumps are of finite or infinite variation. In an application to high-frequency data of options written on the S\&amp;P 500 index, we find evidence for infinite variation volatility jumps.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Bernoulli distributions and minimal dependence copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key result of this paper is to characterize all the multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions whose sum is minimal under convex order. In doing so, we automatically characterize extremal negative dependence among Bernoulli variables, since multivariate distributions with minimal convex sums are known to be strongly negative dependent. Moreover, beyond its interest per se, this result provides insight into negative dependence within the class of copulas. In particular, two classes of copulas can be built from multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions: extremal mixture copulas and FGM copulas. We analyze the extremal negative dependence structures of copulas corresponding to symmetric Bernoulli vectors with minimal convex sums and explicitly find a class of minimal dependence copulas. Our main results derive from the geometric and algebraic representations of multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions, which effectively encode key statistical properties.</description>

      <title>Geometric Martingale Benamou-Brenier transport and geometric Bass martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study geometric Bass martingales. Bass martingales were introduced in \cite{Ba83} and studied recently in a series of works, including \cite{BaBeHuKa20,BaBeScTs23}, where they appear as solutions to the martingale version of the Benamou-Brenier optimal transport formulation. These arithmetic, as well as our novel geometric, Bass martingales are continuous martingale on $[0,1]$ with prescribed initial and terminal distributions. An arithmetic Bass martingale is the one closest to Brownian motion: its quadratic variation is as close as possible to being linear in the averaged $L^2$ sense. Its geometric counterpart we develop here, is the one closest to a geometric Brownian motion: the quadratic variation of its logarithm is as close as possible to being linear. By analogy between Bachelier and Black-Scholes models in mathematical finance, the newly obtained geometric Bass martingales} have the potential to be of more practical importance in a number of applications.
  Our main contribution is to exhibit an explicit bijection between geometric Bass martingales and their arithmetic counterparts. This allows us, in particular, to translate fine properties of the latter into the new geometric setting. We obtain an explicit representation for a geometric Bass martingale for given initial and terminal marginals, we characterise it as a solution to an SDE, and we show that geometric Brownian motion is the only process which is both an arithmetic and a geometric Bass martingale. Finally, we deduce a dual formulation for our geometric martingale Benamou-Brenier problem. Our main proof is probabilistic in nature and uses a suitable change of measure, but we also provide PDE arguments relying on the dual formulation of the problem, which offer a rigorous proof under suitable regularity assumptions.</description>
