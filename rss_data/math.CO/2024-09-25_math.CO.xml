      <title>Two results towards the approximation of special maximum matchings in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ define the parameters $\ell(G)$ and $L(G)$ as the minimum and maximum value of $\nu(G\backslash F)$, where $F$ is a maximum matching of $G$ and $\nu(G)$ is the number of edges in it. In this paper, we show that there is a small constant $c&gt;0$, such that the following decision problem is NP-complete: given a graph $G$ and $k\leq \frac{|V|}{2}$, check whether there is a maximum matching $F$ in $G$, such that $|\nu(G\backslash F)-k|\leq c\cdot |V|$. Note that when $c=1$, this problem is polynomial time solvable as we observe in the paper. Since in any graph $G$, we have $L(G)\leq 2\ell(G)$, any polynomial time algorithm constructing a maximum matching of a graph is a 2-approximation algorithm for $\ell(G)$ and $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for $L(G)$. We complement these observations by presenting two inapproximability results for $\ell(G)$ and $L(G)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an exposition of identities containing q-multiple sums given by Dilcher, Prodinger, Fu and Lascoux, Zeng, Guo and Zhang. Meanwhile, for each of these identities, a more powerful statement will be derived through our exposition. Our exposition shall also provide a generalization of the duality relation for finite multiple harmonic $q$-series given by Bradley.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Lower Bounds for the Feedback Arc Set Problem in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a directed graph, the Minimal Feedback Arc Set (FAS) problem asks for a minimal set of arcs in a directed graph, which, when removed, results in an acyclic graph. Equivalently, the FAS problem asks to find an ordering of the vertices that minimizes the number of feedback arcs. This is considered an algorithmic problem of central importance in discrete mathematics, with varied applications to problems in computer science and operations research. Berger and Shor, in 1990, developed upper bounds for the FAS problem in general directed graphs. Here we find asymptotic lower bounds for the FAS problem in a class of random graphs given by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model G(n,M), with n vertices and M (undirected) edges, the latter randomly chosen. Each edge is then randomly given a direction to form our directed graph. Our interest is in developing a $\textit{lower}$ bound for the minimal feedback arc set that holds with probability 1 as $n\rightarrow \infty$. We show that $$Pr\left(\textbf{Y}^* \le M \left( \frac{1}{2} -\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{2\Delta_{av}}}\right)\right)$$ approaches zero exponentially in $n$, with $\textbf{Y}^*$ the (random) size of the minimal feedback set and $\Delta_{av}=M/n$ the average vertex degree.
  We subsequently apply our lower bounds to a set of experimental FAS data on related random graphs, as developed by Kathrin Hanauer. Not only does our formula provide a reasonably close lower bound for the minimal set, but the approximation that lies midway between our lower bound and the obvious upper bound of $M/2$ is remarkably close to the computed FAS data over a range of experiments, suggesting that this approximation may in fact be asymptotic to the minimal number of feedback arcs, for large $n$, and an excellent estimate even for moderate values.</description>

      <title>The ring of stable characters over $\text{GL}_\bullet(q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed prime power $q$, let $\text{GL}_\bullet(q)$ denote the family of groups $\text{GL}_N(q)$ for $N \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. In this paper we study the $\mathbb{C}$-algebra of "stable" class functions of $\text{GL}_\bullet(q)$, and show it admits four different linear bases, each arising naturally in different settings. One such basis is that of stable irreducible characters, namely, the class functions spanned by the characters corresponding to finitely generated simple $\mathrm{VI}$-modules in the sense of [arXiv:1408.3694,arXiv:1602.00654]. A second one comes from characters of parabolic representations. The final two, one originally defined in [arXiv:1803.04155] and the other in [arXiv:2110.11099], are more combinatorial in nature. As corollaries, we clarify many properties of these four bases and prove a conjecture from [arXiv:2106.11587].</description>

      <title>A new class of magic positive Ehrhart polynomials of reflexive polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magic positivity of Ehrhart polynomials is a useful tool for proving the real-rootedness of the $h^\ast$-polynomials. In this paper, we provide a new class of reflexive polytopes whose Ehrhart polynomials are magic positive. First, we prove that the Ehrhart polynomials of Stasheff polytopes are magic positive. Second, we provide a partial proof of the magic positivity of the Ehrhart polynomials of the dual polytopes of the symmetric edge polytopes of cycles.</description>

      <title>The 2-domination number of cylindrical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex subset S of a graph G is said to 2-dominate the graph if each vertex not in S has at least two neighbors in it. As usual, the associated parameter is the minimum cardinal of a 2-dominating set, which is called the 2-domination number of the graph G. We present both lower and upper bounds of the 2-domination number of cylinders, which are the Cartesian products of a path and a cycle. These bounds allow us to compute the exact value of the 2-domination number of cylinders where the path is arbitrary, and the order of the cycle is n $\equiv$ 0(mod 3) and as large as desired. In the case of the lower bound, we adapt the technique of the wasted domination to this parameter and we use the so-called tropical matrix product to obtain the desired bound. Moreover, we provide a regular patterned construction of a minimum 2-dominating set in the cylinders having the mentioned cycle order.</description>

Abstract: We consider how $f$-vectors of Cohen--Macaulay and vertex decomposable flag complexes in geometric settings decompose and interact with geometric transformations. This includes subdivisions of simplicial complexes and explicit equations connecting them to $f$-vectors. Applications from this approach include positivity properties of polynomials built out of simplicial complexes lying between unimodality and real-rootedness.</description>

      <title>A variant of the Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'arf\'as problem for $K_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Alon initiated the study of graph codes and their linear variants in analogy to the study of error correcting codes in theoretical computer science. Alon related the maximum density of a linear graph code which avoids images of a small graph $H$ to the following variant of the Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'arf\'as problem on edge-colourings of $K_n$. A copy of $H$ in an edge-colouring of $K_n$ is even-chromatic if each colour occupies an even number of edges in the copy. We seek an edge-colouring of $K_n$ using $n^{o(1)}$ colours such that there are no even-chromatic copies of $H$. Such an edge-colouring is conjectured to exist for all cliques $K_t$ with an even number of edges. To date, edge-colourings satisfying this property have been constructed for $K_4$ and $K_5$.
  We construct an edge-colouring using $n^{o(1)}$ colours which avoids even-chromatic copies of $K_8$. This was the smallest open case of the above conjecture, as $K_6, K_7$ each has an odd number of edges. We also study a stronger condition on edge-colourings, where for each copy of $H$, there is a colour occupying exactly one edge in the copy. We conjecture that an edge-colouring using $n^{o(1)}$ colours and satisfying this stronger requirement exists for all cliques $K_t$ regardless of the parity of the number of its edges. We construct edge-colourings satisfying this stronger property for $K_4$ and $K_5$. These constructions also improve upon the number of colours needed for the original problem of avoiding even-chromatic copies of $K_4$ and $K_5$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper develops elementary linear algebra methods to compute the determinants of the tensor symmetrizations of quadratic and hermitian forms over fields of good characteristic. Explicit results are given for the partitions $(n)$, $(1^n)$, $(2,1^{n-2})$ and $(3,1^{n-3})$ as well as for all partitions of $n\leq 7$. For orthogonal groups these symmetrizations are not irreducible and we continue to find the determinants of their irreducible constituents, the refined symmetrizations, over fields of characteristic 0.</description>

Abstract: By "geodesic" we mean any sequence of vertices $(v_1,v_2,...,v_k)$ of a graph $G$ that constitute a shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_k$. We propose a novel, output-polynomial algorithm to enumerate all geodesics of $G$. The graph can be directed or not, and weighted or not.</description>

      <title>A Cubical Perspective on Complements of Union-Closed Families of Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complements of union-closed families of sets, over a finite ground set, are known as simply rooted families of sets. Cubical sets are widely studied topological objects having applications in computational homology. In this paper, we look at simply rooted families of sets from the perspective of cubical sets. That is, for every family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of a finite set, we construct a natural cubical set $X(\mathcal F)$ (corresponding to it). We show that for every simply rooted family $\mathcal F$, containing the empty set, the cubical set $X(\mathcal F)$ is always acyclic (that is, it has trivial reduced cubical homology). As a consequence of this, using the Euler-Poincar\`{e} formula, we obtain a formula satisfied by all simply rooted families of sets which contain the empty set. We also provide an elementary proof of this formula.</description>

      <title>Pentagon Minimization without Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Guy initiated a line of research studying $\mu_k(n)$, the minimum number of convex $k$-gons one can obtain by placing $n$ points in the plane without any three of them being collinear. Asymptotically, the limits $c_k := \lim_{n\to \infty} \mu_k(n)/\binom{n}{k}$ exist for all $k$, and are strictly positive due to the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem. This article focuses on the case $k=5$, where $c_5$ was known to be between $0.0608516$ and $0.0625$ (Goaoc et al., 2018; Subercaseaux et al., 2023). The lower bound was obtained through the Flag Algebra method of Razborov using semi-definite programming. In this article we prove a more modest lower bound of $\frac{5\sqrt{5}-11}{4} \approx 0.04508$ without any computation; we exploit``planar-point equations'' that count, in different ways, the number of convex pentagons (or other geometric objects) in a point placement. To derive our lower bound we combine such equations by viewing them from a statistical perspective, which we believe can be fruitful for other related problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p$ prime, $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{Z}$, the sum of dilates $A + \lambda \cdot A$ is defined by \[A + \lambda \cdot A = \{a + \lambda a' : a, a' \in A\}.\] The basic problem on such sums of dilates asks for the minimum size of $|A + \lambda \cdot A|$ for given $\lambda$, $A$ of given density $\alpha$, and $p$ tending to infinity. We investigate this problem for $\alpha$ fixed and $\lambda$ tending to infinity, proving near-optimal bounds in this case.</description>

      <title>On the Bivariate Characteristic Polynomial of the Shuffle Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shuffle lattice was introduced by Greene in 1988 as an idealized model for DNA mutation, when he revealed remarkable combinatorial properties of this structure. In this paper, we prove an explicit formula for the $M$-triangle of the shuffle lattice, a bivariate refinement of the characteristic polynomial, as conjectured by McConville and M\"uhle in 2022, and find a relation between the $M$-triangle and the $H$-triangle, a bivariate refinement of the rank generating function.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Codes from Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of mathematics, a purely combinatorial equivalent to a simplicial complex, or more generally, a down-set, is an abstract structure known as a family of sets. This family is closed under the operation of taking subsets, meaning that every subset of a set within the family is also included in the family. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, it aims to present a comprehensive survey of recent results in the field. This survey intends to provide an overview of the advancements made in codes constructed from simplicial complexes. Secondly, the paper seeks to propose open problems that are anticipated to stimulate further research in this area. By highlighting these open problems, the paper aims to encourage and inspire future investigations and developments in the field of codes derived from simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for the Biased Random Transposition Shuffle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the biased random transposition shuffle, a natural generalization of the classical random transposition shuffle studied by Diaconis and Shahshahani. We diagonalize the transition matrix of the shuffle and use these eigenvalues to prove that the shuffle exhibits total variation cutoff at time $t_N = \frac{1}{2b} N \log N$ with window $N$. We also prove that the limiting distribution of the number of fixed cards near the cutoff time is Poisson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $\mathscr A$ is a set of natural numbers of exponential density $\delta$, then the exponential density of all numbers of the form $x^3+a$ with $x\in\mathbb N$ and $a\in\mathscr A$ is at least $\min(1, \frac 13+\frac 56 \delta)$. This is a considerable improvement on the previous best lower bounds for this problem, obtained by Davenport more than 80 years ago. The result is the best possible for $\delta\ge \frac 45$.</description>

      <title>Concentration of information on discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Asymptotic Equipartition Property and its recently discovered role in the cutoff phenomenon, we initiate the systematic study of varentropy on discrete groups. Our main result is an approximate tensorization inequality which asserts that the varentropy of any conjugacy-invariant random walk is, up to a universal multiplicative constant, at most that of the free Abelian random walk with the same jump rates. In particular, it is always bounded by the number d of generators, uniformly in time and in the size of the group. This universal estimate is sharp and can be seen as a discrete analogue of a celebrated result of Bobkov and Madiman concerning random d-dimensional vectors with a log-concave density (AOP 2011). A key ingredient in our proof is the fact that conjugacy-invariant random walks have non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, a result which seems new and of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Global Rigidity of Triangulated Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is the graph of a connected triangulated $(d-1)$-manifold, for $d\geq 3$, then $G$ is generically globally rigid in $\mathbb R^d$ if and only if it is $(d+1)$-connected and, if $d=3$, $G$ is not planar. The special case $d=3$ verifies a conjecture of Connelly. Our results actually apply to a much larger class of simplicial complexes, namely the circuits of the simplicial matroid. We also give two significant applications of our main theorems. We show that that the characterisation of pseudomanifolds with extremal edge numbers given by the Lower Bound Theorem extends to circuits of the simplicial matroid. We also prove the generic case of a conjecture of Kalai concerning the reconstructability of a polytope from its space of stresses. The proofs of our main results adapt earlier ideas of Fogelsanger and Whiteley to the setting of global rigidity. In particular we verify a special case of Whiteley's vertex splitting conjecture for global rigidity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer $n$, let $G(n)$ be the number of integer sequences $n-1\ge d_1\ge d_2\ge\dotsb\ge d_n\ge 0$ that are the degree sequence of some graph. We show that $G(n)=(c+o(1))4^n/n^{3/4}$ for some constant $c&gt;0$, improving both the previously best upper and lower bounds by a factor of $n^{1/4}$ (up to polylog-factors).
  Additionally, we answer a question of Royle, extend the values of $n$ for which the exact value of $G(n)$ is known from $n\le290$ to $n\le 1651$ and determine the asymptotic probability that the integral of a (lazy) simple symmetric random walk bridge remains non-negative.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the genus for 2-cell embeddings of prefix-reversal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide bounds for the genus of the pancake graph $\mathbb{P}_n$, burnt pancake graph $\mathbb{BP}_n$, and undirected generalized pancake graph $\mathbb{P}_m(n)$. Our upper bound for $\mathbb{P}_n$ is sharper than the previously-known bound, and the other bounds presented are the first of their kind. Our proofs are constructive and rely on finding an appropriate rotation system (also referred to in the literature as Edmonds' permutation technique) where certain cycles in the graphs we consider become boundaries of regions of a 2-cell embedding. A key ingredient in the proof of our bounds for the genus $\mathbb{P}_n$ and $\mathbb{BP}_n$ is a labeling algorithm of their vertices that allows us to implement rotation systems to bound the number of regions of a 2-cell embedding of said graphs. All of our bounds are asymptotically tight; in particular, the genus of $\mathbb{P}_m(n)$ is $\Theta(m^nnn!)$ for all $m\geq1$ and $n\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Perfect matchings and loose Hamilton cycles in the semirandom hypergraph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 2-offer semirandom 3-uniform hypergraph model on $n$ vertices. At each step, we are presented with 2 uniformly random vertices. We choose any other vertex, thus creating a hyperedge of size 3. We show a strategy that constructs a perfect matching, and another that constructs a loose Hamilton cycle, both succeeding asymptotically almost surely within $\Theta(n)$ steps. Both results extend to $s$-uniform hypergraphs. The challenges with hypergraphs, and our methods, are qualitatively different from what has been seen for semirandom graphs. Much of our analysis is done on an auxiliary graph that is a uniform $k$-out subgraph of a random bipartite graph, and this tool may be useful in other contexts.</description>

Abstract: We propose a combinatorial formula for the coproduct in a Hopf algebra of decorated multi-indices that recently appeared in the literature, which can be briefly described as the graded dual of the enveloping algebra of the free Novikov algebra generated by the set of decorations. Similarly to what happens for the Hopf algebra of rooted forests, the formula can be written in terms of admissible cuts. We also prove a combinatorial formula for the extraction-contraction coproduct for undecorated multi-indices, in terms of a suitable notion of covering subforest.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and decidability of translational tilings by rational polygonal sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that if a region $\Sigma\subset \mathbb R^d$ tiles $\mathbb R^d$ by translations then it admits at least one fully periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold in $\mathbb R$, and recently it was disproved in sufficiently high dimensions. In this paper, we study the periodic tiling conjecture for polygonal sets: bounded open sets in $\mathbb R^2$ whose boundary is a finite union of line segments. We prove the periodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational. As a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by rational polygonal sets. Moreover, we prove that any translational tiling by a rational polygonal tile is weakly-periodic, i.e., can be partitioned into finitely many singly-periodic pieces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>

      <title>The probability that a random graph is even-decomposable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ with an even number of edges is called even-decomposable if there is a sequence $V(G)=V_0\supset V_1\supset \dots \supset V_k=\emptyset$ such that for each $i$, $G[V_i]$ has an even number of edges and $V_i\setminus~V_{i+1}$ is an independent set in $G$. The study of this property was initiated recently by Versteegen, motivated by connections to a Ramsey-type problem and questions about graph codes posed by Alon. Resolving a conjecture of Versteegen, we prove that all but an $e^{-\Omega(n^2)}$ proportion of the $n$-vertex graphs with an even number of edges are even-decomposable. Moreover, answering one of his questions, we determine the order of magnitude of the smallest $p=p(n)$ for which the probability that the random graph $G(n,1-p)$ is even-decomposable (conditional on it having an even number of edges) is at least $1/2$.
  We also study the following closely related property. A graph is called even-degenerate if there is an ordering $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n$ of its vertices such that each $v_i$ has an even number of neighbours in the set $\{v_{i+1},\dots,v_n\}$. We prove that all but an $e^{-\Omega(n)}$ proportion of the $n$-vertex graphs with an even number of edges are even-degenerate, which is tight up to the implied constant.</description>

      <title>On $[1,2]$-Domination in Interval and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a Dominating Set if each vertex in $V(G)\setminus S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$. Chellali et al. in 2013, by restricting the number of neighbors in $S$ of a vertex outside $S$, introduced the concept of $[1,j]$-dominating set. A set $D \subseteq V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is called a $[1,j]$-Dominating Set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor and at most $j$ neighbors in $D$. The Minimum $[1,j]$-Domination problem is the problem of finding the minimum $[1,j]$-dominating set $D$. Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$, the $[1,j]$-Domination Decision problem is to decide whether $G$ has a $[1,j]$-dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. A polynomial-time algorithm was obtained in split graphs for a constant $j$ in contrast to the Dominating Set problem which is NP-hard for split graphs. This result motivates us to investigate the effect of restriction $j$ on the complexity of $[1,j]$-domination problem on various classes of graphs. Although for $j\geq 3$, it has been proved that the minimum of classical domination is equal to minimum $[1,j]$-domination in interval graphs, the complexity of finding the minimum $[1,2]$-domination in interval graphs is still outstanding. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set on interval graphs by a dynamic programming technique. Next, on the negative side, we show that the minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set problem on circle graphs is $NP$-complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study what we call Superset-Subset-Disjoint (SSD) set system. Based on properties of SSD set system, we derive the following (I) to (IV):
  (I) For a nonnegative integer $k$ and a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|\ge2$, let $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q\subsetneq V$ denote all maximal proper subsets of $V$ that induce $k$-edge-connected subgraphs. Then at least one of (a) and (b) holds: (a) $\{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q\}$ is a partition of $V$; and (b) $V\setminus X_1, V\setminus X_2,\dots,V\setminus X_q$ are pairwise disjoint.
  (II) For $k=1$ and a strongly-connected digraph $G$, whether $V$ is in (a) and/or (b) can be decided in $O(n+m)$ time and we can generate all such $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q$ in $O(n+m+|X_1|+|X_2|+\dots+|X_q|)$ time, where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$.
  (III) For a digraph $G$, we can enumerate in linear delay all vertex subsets of $V$ that induce strongly-connected subgraphs.
  (IV) A digraph is Hamiltonian if there is a spanning subgraph that is strongly-connected and in the case (a).</description>

Abstract: The paper studies how to compute irreducible characters of the generalized symmetric group $C_k\wr{S}_n$ by iterative algorithms. After reproving the Ariki-Koike version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule by vertex algebraic methods, we formulate a new iterative formula for characters of the generalized symmetric group. As applications, we find a numerical relation between the character values of $C_k\wr S_n$ and modular characters of $S_{kn}$.</description>
