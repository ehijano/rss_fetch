      <title>Transition-based vs stated-based acceptance for automata over infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automata over infinite objects are a well-established model with applications in logic and formal verification. Traditionally, acceptance in such automata is defined based on the set of states visited infinitely often during a run. However, there is a growing trend towards defining acceptance based on transitions rather than states.
  In this survey, we analyse the reasons for this shift and advocate using transition-based acceptance in the context of automata over infinite words. We present a collection of problems where the choice of formalism has a major impact and discuss the causes of these differences.</description>

      <title>List of Results on the \v{C}ern\'y Conjecture and Reset Thresholds for Synchronizing Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey results in the literature that establish the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture for various classes of finite automata. We also list classes for which the conjecture remains open, but a quadratic (in the number of states) upper bound on the minimum length of reset words is known. The results presented reflect the state of the art as of August 21, 2025.</description>

      <title>A cornering strategy for synchronizing a DFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the existence of short synchronizing words in deterministic finite automata (DFAs). We define two general strategies for generating synchronizing words, and we show that each of these strategies can be applied if and only if a DFA is synchronizable. Furthermore, we show that if a synchronizable DFA is well-structured, then our strategies generate short synchronizing words. The first of our strategies, called the cornering strategy, takes advantage of states in a DFA with properties similar to those of a polytope vertex. The second of our strategies, similar to the cornering strategy and called the $f$-ordered strategy, takes advantage of a partial order defined on the states of a DFA.
  We apply our cornering strategy to the class of difference DFAs, whose states form subsets of $\mathbb R^d$ and whose input symbols correspond to translation vectors between states. We show that difference DFAs share many similarities with aperiodic DFAs, and in particular, a difference DFA $M$ has a synchronizing word if and only if it has a universally reachable state. Using the cornering strategy, we also show that under certain conditions, such an $n$-state DFA $M$ has a synchronizing word of length at most $(n-1)^2$ and thereby satisfies \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture. Using the $f$-ordered strategy, we also show that a synchronizable DFA whose states have a certain partial order that is preserved by a set of short words also has a short synchronizing word, and we consider several consequences of this result.
  Finally, we consider how the cornering strategy can be applied to the problem of synchronizing the product of two DFAs $M_1, M_2$ that share a common alphabet, and we show that the product $M_1 \times M_2$ often has a synchronizing word that is subquadratic in the number of states of $M_1 \times M_2$.</description>
