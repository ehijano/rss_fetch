      <title>Progress in the Development of Multi-Element Monolithic Germanium Detectors in LEAPS-INNOV Project: Insights from Detector Performance Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed simulation-based analysis of the detection limits of multi-element monolithic Germanium (Ge) detectors to cadmium traces in environmental soil samples. Using the capabilities of the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit in combination with the Solid State Detector Package, we evaluated the detection limit variation with the sample-to-detector distances and photon flux. These simulations were conducted to mimic realistic conditions, with a photon flux measured by the SAMBA beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. Our findings for the detection limit for trace amounts of pollutants in low concentrations like cadmium in the soil provide valuable insights for optimizing experimental setups in environmental monitoring and synchrotron-based applications, where precise detection of trace elements is critical.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric muon flux suppression at potential new low-radiation underground physics laboratory in Israel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual atmospheric muon flux was measured at a candidate site for a new underground, low-radiation physics laboratory beneath the Kokhav HaYarden national park in Israel. Located inside the tunnels of a hydroelectric pumped-storage facility operating since 2024, the proposed site benefits from a vertical rock overburden of 361 meters, large potential floorspace, and easy access by road. A muon hodoscope of vertically stacked wide-area $144 \times 60 \times 1.2 $ cm$^3$ plastic scintillator plates was employed to measure the suppression in the integrated muon flux at the site as compared with above ground at sea level. Data-taking took place in mid-August of 2024 for several days and was split into South-North and West-East orientations to account for the directional acceptances due to the geometry of the detector. The suppression factor is reported at $4456 \pm 77$, expressed as $3.75 \pm 0.06 \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in absolute terms, corresponding to an effective overburden of roughly $873$ m.w.e.. A deeper location at the site may also be available, but it could not be reached at this time. Furthermore, the asymmetric topography of the mountain above and its muon shadow are clearly visible in the angular data. Finally, auxiliary environmental measurements recorded low background radon activity at $28.3 \pm 14.0$ Bq m$^{-3}$. The experimental campaign thus succeeded in demonstrating the viability of the site's working conditions for future scientific research.</description>

      <title>Muon Imaging of Hydrotreatment Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the design and simulation-based validation of a muon imaging system tailored for potential applications in industrial hydrotreatment towers. The system is built around a two-panel plastic scintillator hodoscope, equipped with silicon photomultipliers and read-out via a CAEN FERS-A5202 acquisition system. The detector was calibrated using a stepwise ``staircase'' method and characterized under open-sky and controlled conditions. We conducted muon flux attenuation measurements to validate its response using variable lead shielding. We found agreement with simulations generated using the MEIGA framework and realistic cosmic ray spectra from the ARTI simulation chain. With the detector response validated, we modelled muon transmission through a realistic 3D representation of a hydrotreatment tower, incorporating internal variations in catalyst bed density. By reconstructing angular muon fluxes and computing relative attenuation maps, we demonstrated the system's capability to detect internal density contrasts. Simulation results indicate that 20~hours of exposure to vertical muon flux is sufficient to retrieve structural information. In comparison, inclined configurations (30$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$ from vertical) require extended exposure times--up to 8~days--yet remain feasible within industrial monitoring schedules. These findings highlight the feasibility of muography as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for complex industrial infrastructure. The proposed system shows strong potential for real-time monitoring of catalyst bed integrity and long-term structural analysis in high-pressure chemical reactors.</description>

      <title>Optimizations of electronic stopping cross section measurements using the backscattering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate determination of electronic stopping cross sections is essential for advancing nuclear science and materials research. In this work, we present an optimized methodology for stopping power measurements using the backscattering technique, with a focus on minimizing both random and systematic uncertainties. By systematically analyzing the sources of uncertainty and refining the experimental geometry, we establish a robust framework for high-precision measurements. Our approach was applied to the stopping power of helium ions in gold thin films, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference models such as SRIM and ICRU-49. The results reveal that carefully chosen measurement angles can effectively balance statistical precision and systematic accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3% across a wide energy range. This study provides a refined strategy for stopping power determination, offering valuable improvements for ion beam analysis and benchmarking theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Development of 6-inch 80-170 GHz broadband silicon plated horn antenna arrays for primordial gravitational wave search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for primordial gravitational wave in cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization signal is one of the key topics in modern cosmology. Cutting-edge CMB telescopes requires thousands of pixels to maximize mapping speed. Using modular design, the telescope focal plane is simplified as several detector modules. Each module has hundreds of pixels including antenna arrays, detector arrays, and readout arrays. The antenna arrays, as the beam defining component, determine the overall optical response of the detector module. In this article, we present the developments of 6-inch broadband antenna arrays from 80GHz to 170GHz for the future IHEP focal plane module. The arrays are fabricated from 42 6-inch silicon wafers including 456 antennas, 7% more pixels than usual design. The overall in-band cross polarization is smaller than -20 dB and the in-band beam asymmetry is smaller than 10%, fulfilling the requirements for primordial gravitational wave search.</description>

      <title>Testing the limits of ITkPixV2: the ATLAS inner tracker pixel detector readout chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ITkPixV2 chip is the final production readout chip for the ATLAS Phase 2 Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade at the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Due to the extraordinarily high peak luminosity at the HL-LHC of $5 \times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, ITkPixV2 must meet significant increases in nearly all design requirements compared to the current ATLAS Inner Detector (ID), including a 10x increase in trigger rate, a 7.5x increase in hit rate, a 3x increase in radiation tolerance, and a 12.5x decrease in pixel current draw per unit area, all while maintaining a similar power per unit area as present pixel detectors. Here we present the first measurements of the ITkPixV2 chip operated at the limits of the full chip design requirements, including in particular a measurement of the activity-induced current of the chip as a function of increasing hit rate.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01239v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with unprecented energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to characterize the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic model for time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve vertex position resolution better than 20mm, energy resolution of about 2% at 1MeV and &lt;0.5% non-uniformity, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. With such resolution, we perceive MeV events to exhibit track effects. It opens up an exciting possibility of computed tracking calorimeter for unsegmented liquid scintillator detector like TAO. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>

      <title>AI-based particle track identification in scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-powered data cleaning for LEGEND: a semi-supervised approach using affinity propagation and support vector machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare nuclear process that, if observed, will provide insight into the nature of neutrinos and help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay (LEGEND) will operate in two phases to search for $0\nu\beta\beta$. The first (second) stage will employ 200 (1000) kg of High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) enriched in $^{76}$Ge to achieve a half-life sensitivity of 10$^{27}$ (10$^{28}$) years. In this study, we present a semi-supervised data-driven approach to remove non-physical events captured by HPGe detectors powered by a novel artificial intelligence model. We utilize Affinity Propagation to cluster waveform signals based on their shape and a Support Vector Machine to classify them into different categories. We train, optimize, test our model on data taken from a natural abundance HPGe detector installed in the Full Chain Test experimental stand at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We demonstrate that our model yields a maximum sacrifice of physics events of $0.024 ^{+0.004}_{-0.003} \%$. Our model is being used to accelerate data cleaning development for LEGEND-200 and will serve to improve data cleaning procedures for LEGEND-1000.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 3-inch Hamamatsu R14374-02 photomultiplier tube is an improved version of the R12199-02 model and its successor in the construction of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. A total of 1000 photomultipliers were analysed to assess their dark count rate, transit time spread, and spurious pulses. A subset of 200 photomultipliers were further evaluated to determine their quantum efficiency which is an essential parameter for Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response. The measurements show that R14374-02 model has better quantum efficiency homogeneity over the photocatode and better time properties than the R12199-02.</description>
