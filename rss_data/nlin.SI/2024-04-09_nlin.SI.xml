      <title>Axialgravisolitons at infinite corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational solitons (gravisolitons) are particular exact solutions of Einstein field equation in vacuum build on a given background solution. Their interpretation and importance is not yet fully clear and in this work we investigate the asymptotically behaviour of axially symmetric gravisolitons given minimal assumptions on the background metric. We develop an explicit systematic asymptotically expansion for the $N$-axialsoliton solution; we compute the leading order of the asymptotic killing vectors and we make a link with the corner symmetry proposal.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the Tzitz\'eica equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the renowned Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to investigate the initial value problem of Tzitz\'eica equation on the line. Initially, our analysis focuses on elucidating the properties of two reflection coefficients, which are determined by the initial values. Subsequently, leveraging these reflection coefficients, we construct a Riemann-Hilbert problem that is a powerful tool to articulate the solution of the Tzitz\'eica equation. Finally, the nonlinear steepest descent method is applied to the oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problem, which enables us to delineate the long-time asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the Tzitz\'eica equation across various regions. Moreover, it is shown that the leading-order terms of asymptotic formulas match well with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A family of integrable maps associated with the Volterra lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Gubbiotti, Joshi, Tran and Viallet classified birational maps in four dimensions admitting two invariants (first integrals) with a particular degree structure, by considering recurrences of fourth order with a certain symmetry. The last three of the maps so obtained were shown to be Liouville integrable, in the sense of admitting a non-degenerate Poisson bracket with two first integrals in involution. Here we show how the first of these three Liouville integrable maps corresponds to genus 2 solutions of the infinite Volterra lattice, being the $g=2$ case of a family of maps associated with the Stieltjes continued fraction expansion of a certain function on a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g\geqslant 1$. The continued fraction method provides explicit Hankel determinant formulae for tau functions of the solutions, together with an algebro-geometric description via a Lax representation for each member of the family, associating it with an algebraic completely integrable system. In particular, in the elliptic case ($g=1$), as a byproduct we obtain Hankel determinant expressions for the solutions of the Somos-5 recurrence, but different to those previously derived by Chang, Hu and Xin. By applying contraction to the Stieltjes fraction, we recover integrable maps associated with Jacobi continued fractions on hyperelliptic curves, that one of us considered previously, as well as the Miura-type transformation between the Volterra and Toda lattices.</description>

      <title>Spectral and linear stability of peakons in the Novikov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Novikov equation is a peakon equation with cubic nonlinearity which, like the Camassa-Holm and the Degasperis-Procesi, is completely integrable. In this article, we study the spectral and linear stability of peakon solutions of the Novikov equation. We prove spectral instability of the peakons in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. To do so, we start with a linearized operator defined on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ and extend it to a linearized operator defined on weaker functions in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The spectrum of the linearized operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is proven to cover a closed vertical strip of the complex plane. Furthermore, we prove that the peakons are spectrally unstable on $W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ and linearly and spectrally stable on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$. The result on $W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ are in agreement with previous work about linear stability, while our results on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ are in agreement with the orbital stability obtained previously.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Large-Charge Sectors in Generic 2D EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that integrability is an accidental property of generic two-dimensional $O(2)$-symmetric asymptotically-free theories in the regime where the charge density is much larger than the dynamical scale. We show this by constructing an infinite tower of higher-spin conserved currents in the most generic effective Lagrangian at large chemical potential to all orders in perturbative expansion in the renormalization-group invariant coupling constant.</description>
