      <title>Towards a Molecular Computer: Enabling Arithmetic Operations in Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current molecular communication (MC) systems, performing computational operations at the nanoscale remains challenging, restricting their applicability in complex scenarios such as adaptive biochemical control and advanced nanoscale sensing. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework that seamlessly integrates computation into the molecular communication process. The system enables arithmetic operations, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, by encoding numerical values into two types of molecules emitted by each transmitter to represent positive and negative values, respectively. Specifically, addition is achieved by transmitting non-reactive molecules, while subtraction employs reactive molecules that interact during propagation. The receiver demodulates molecular counts to directly compute the desired results. Theoretical analysis for an upper bound on the bit error rate (BER), and computational simulations confirm the system's robustness in performing complex arithmetic tasks. Compared to conventional MC methods, the proposed approach not only enables fundamental computational operations at the nanoscale but also lays the groundwork for intelligent, autonomous molecular networks.</description>

      <title>Reducing Complexity of Data-Aided Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the data-aided channel estimation (CE) problem in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication system, where the channel and information symbols are estimated jointly during the CE phase, differently from pure pilot-aided methods. We propose a two-stage semi-blind receiver that jointly estimates the combined channel and the data symbols, followed by channel decoupling. To this end, we derive a new modeling framework whose first stage recasts the received signal to allow for the joint estimation of the combined channel and transmitted symbols. In the second stage, channel decoupling is easily achieved via Khatri-Rao factorization, yielding a refined channel estimate. Our solution yields accurate estimates of the cascaded channel at lower computational complexity. Simulation results reveal a similar performance of the proposed method to that of the competitor while providing a substantially reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Linear Model of RIS-Aided High-Mobility Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a crucial solution for providing reliable data services to vehicles on the road. However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility communications, the rapid movement of vehicles can lead to random scattering in the environment and time-selective fading in the channel. In view of this, we investigate in this paper an innovative linear model with low-complexity transmitter signal design and receiver detection methods, which boost stability in fast-fading environments and reduce channel training overhead. Specifically, considering the differences in hardware design and signal processing at the receiving end between uplink and downlink communication systems, distinct solutions are proposed. Accordingly, we first integrate the Rician channel introduced by the RIS with the corresponding signal processing algorithms to model the RIS-aided downlink communication system as a Doppler-robust linear model. Inspired by this property, we design a precoding scheme based on the linear model to reduce the complexity of precoding. Then, by leveraging the linear model and the large-scale antenna array at the base station (BS) side, we improve the linear model for the uplink communication system and derive its asymptotic performance in closed-form. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed RIS-aided high-mobility communication system compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Multi-model Stochastic Particle-based Variational Bayesian Inference for Multiband Delay Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint utilization of multiple discrete frequency bands can enhance the accuracy of delay estimation. Although some unique challenges of multiband fusion, such as phase distortion, oscillation phenomena, and high-dimensional search, have been partially addressed, further challenges remain. Specifically, under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), insufficient data, and closely spaced delay paths, accurately determining the model order-the number of delay paths-becomes difficult. Misestimating the model order can significantly degrade the estimation performance of traditional methods. To address joint model selection and parameter estimation under such harsh conditions, we propose a multi-model stochastic particle-based variational Bayesian inference (MM-SPVBI) framework, capable of exploring multiple high-dimensional parameter spaces. Initially, we split potential overlapping primary delay paths based on coarse estimates, generating several parallel candidate models. Then, an auto-focusing sampling strategy is employed to quickly identify the optimal model. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid posterior approximation to improve the original single-model SPVBI, ensuring overall complexity does not increase significantly with parallelism. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm offers substantial advantages over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Empowered SPEI Drought Forecasting Algorithm Using Spatially-Aware Mamba Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the intensifying impacts of extreme climate changes, drought forecasting (DF), which aims to predict droughts from historical meteorological data, has become increasingly critical for monitoring and managing water resources. Though drought conditions often exhibit spatial climatic coherence among neighboring regions, benchmark deep learning-based DF methods overlook this fact and predict the conditions on a region-by-region basis. Using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), we designed and trained a novel and transformative spatially-aware DF neural network, which effectively captures local interactions among neighboring regions, resulting in enhanced spatial coherence and prediction accuracy. As DF also requires sophisticated temporal analysis, the Mamba network, recognized as the most accurate and efficient existing time-sequence modeling, was adopted to extract temporal features from short-term time frames. We also adopted quantum neural networks (QNN) to entangle the spatial features of different time instances, leading to refined spatiotemporal features of seven different meteorological variables for effectively identifying short-term climate fluctuations. In the last stage of our proposed SPEI-driven quantum spatially-aware Mamba network (SQUARE-Mamba), the extracted spatiotemporal features of seven different meteorological variables were fused to achieve more accurate DF. Validation experiments across El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and normal years demonstrated the superiority of the proposed SQUARE-Mamba, remarkably achieving an average improvement of more than 9.8% in the coefficient of determination index (R^2) compared to baseline methods, thereby illustrating the promising roles of the temporal quantum entanglement and Mamba temporal analysis to achieve more accurate DF.</description>

      <title>Denoising bivariate signals via smoothing and polarization priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two formulations to leverage the geometric properties of bivariate signals for dealing with the denoising problem. In doing so, we use the instantaneous Stokes parameters to incorporate the polarization state of the signal. While the first formulation exploits the statistics of the Stokes representation in a Bayesian setting, the second uses a kernel regression formulation to impose locally smooth time-varying polarization properties. In turn, we obtain two formulations that allow us to use both signal and polarization domain regularization for denoising a bivariate signal. The solutions to them exploit the polarization information efficiently as demonstrated in the numerical simulations</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Aided Multiuser Communications: Antenna Position Optimization Based on Statistical Channel Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movable antenna (MA) technology has attracted great attention recently due to its promising capability in improving wireless channel conditions by flexibly adjusting antenna positions. To reap maximal performance gains of MA systems, existing works mainly focus on MA position optimization to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, the resulting real-time antenna movement may face challenges in practical implementation due to the additional time overhead and energy consumption required, especially in fast time-varying channel scenarios. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new approach to optimize the MA positions based on the users' statistical CSI over a large timescale. In particular, we propose a general field response based statistical channel model to characterize the random channel variations caused by the local movement of users. Based on this model, a two-timescale optimization problem is formulated to maximize the ergodic sum rate of multiple users, where the precoding matrix and the positions of MAs at the base station (BS) are optimized based on the instantaneous and statistical CSI, respectively. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, a log-barrier penalized gradient ascent algorithm is developed to optimize the MA positions, where two methods are proposed to approximate the ergodic sum rate and its gradients with different complexities. Finally, we present simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed design and algorithms based on practical channels generated by ray-tracing. The results verify the performance advantages of MA systems compared to their fixed-position antenna (FPA) counterparts in terms of long-term rate improvement, especially for scenarios with more diverse channel power distributions in the angular domain.</description>

      <title>Data-Importance-Aware Waterfilling for Adaptive Real-Time Communication in Computer Vision Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for importance-aware adaptive data transmission, designed specifically for real-time computer vision (CV) applications where task-specific fidelity is critical. An importance-weighted mean square error (IMSE) metric is introduced, assigning data importance based on bit positions within pixels and semantic relevance within visual segments, thus providing a task-oriented measure of reconstruction quality.To minimize IMSE under the total power constraint, a data-importance-aware waterfilling approach is proposed to optimally allocate transmission power according to data importance and channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms margin-adaptive waterfilling and equal power allocation strategies, achieving more than $7$ dB and $10$ dB gains in normalized IMSE at high SNRs ($&gt; 10$ dB), respectively. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to enhance data efficiency and robustness in real-time CV applications, especially in bandwidth-limited and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Target Tracking using Robust Sensor Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of tracking moving targets using mobile wireless sensors (of possibly different types). This is a joint estimation and control problem in which a tracking system must take into account both target and sensor dynamics. We make minimal assumptions about the target dynamics, namely only that their accelerations are bounded. We develop a control law that determines the sensor motion control signals so as to maximize target resolvability as the target dynamics evolve. The method is given a tractable formulation that is amenable to an efficient search method and is evaluated in a series of experiments involving both round-trip time based ranging and Doppler frequency shift measurements</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider near-field localization and sensing with an extremely large aperture array under partial blockage of array antennas, where spherical wavefront and spatial non-stationarity are accounted for. We propose an Ising model to characterize the clustered sparsity feature of the blockage pattern, develop an algorithm based on alternating optimization for joint channel parameter estimation and visibility region detection, and further estimate the locations of the user and environmental scatterers.

      <title>End-to-End Deep Learning in Phase Noisy Coherent Optical Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) fiber communications, a novel end-to-end learning framework to mitigate Laser Phase Noise (LPN) impairments is proposed in this paper. Inspired by Autoencoder (AE) principles, the proposed approach trains a model to learn robust symbol sequences capable of combat LPN, even from low-cost distributed feedback (DFB) lasers with linewidths up to 2 MHz. This allows for the use of high-level modulation formats and large-scale Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processing, maximizing spectral efficiency in CO-OFDM systems. By eliminating the need for complex traditional techniques, this approach offers a potentially more efficient and streamlined solution for CO-OFDM systems. The most significant achievement of this study is the demonstration that the proposed AE-based model can enhance system performance by reducing the bit error rate (BER) to below the threshold of forward error correction (FEC), even under severe phase noise conditions, thus proving its effectiveness and efficiency in practical deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>HoloMine: A Synthetic Dataset for Buried Landmines Recognition using Microwave Holographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and removal of landmines is a complex and risky task that requires advanced remote sensing techniques to reduce the risk for the professionals involved in this task. In this paper, we propose a novel synthetic dataset for buried landmine detection to provide researchers with a valuable resource to observe, measure, locate, and address issues in landmine detection. The dataset consists of 41,800 microwave holographic images (2D) and their holographic inverted scans (3D) of different types of buried objects, including landmines, clutter, and pottery objects, and is collected by means of a microwave holography sensor.
  We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on our synthetic dataset for various classification tasks. While the results do not yield yet high performances, showing the difficulty of the proposed task, we believe that our dataset has significant potential to drive progress in the field of landmine detection thanks to the accuracy and resolution obtainable using holographic radars.
  To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first of its kind and will help drive further research on computer vision methods to automatize mine detection, with the overall goal of reducing the risks and the costs of the demining process.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deep-learning method to filter out effects such as ambient noise, reflections, or source directivity from microphone array data represented as cross-spectral matrices. Specifically, we focus on a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture designed to transform fixed-size cross-spectral matrices. Theses models were trained using sound pressure simulations of varying complexity developed for this purpose. Based on the results from applying these methods in a hyperparameter optimization of an auto-encoding task, we trained the optimized model to perform five distinct transformation tasks derived from different complexities inherent in our sound pressure simulations.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Multiparameter Penalty Selection Method for Multiconstraint and Multiblock ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new method for online selection of multiple penalty parameters for the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm applied to optimization problems with multiple constraints or functionals with block matrix components. ADMM is widely used for solving constrained optimization problems in a variety of fields, including signal and image processing. Implementations of ADMM often utilize a single hyperparameter, referred to as the penalty parameter, which needs to be tuned to control the rate of convergence. However, in problems with multiple constraints, ADMM may demonstrate slow convergence regardless of penalty parameter selection due to scale differences between constraints. Accounting for scale differences between constraints to improve convergence in these cases requires introducing a penalty parameter for each constraint. The proposed method is able to adaptively account for differences in scale between constraints, providing robustness with respect to problem transformations and initial selection of penalty parameters. It is also simple to understand and implement. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably compared to a variety of existing penalty parameter selection methods.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) methods can reconstruct highly accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, but they rely on application-specific large training datasets and often generalize poorly to out-of-distribution data. Self-supervised deep learning algorithms perform scan-specific reconstructions, but still require complicated hyperparameter tuning based on the acquisition and often offer limited acceleration. This work develops a bilevel-optimized implicit neural representation (INR) approach for scan-specific MRI reconstruction. The method automatically optimizes the hyperparameters for a given acquisition protocol, enabling a tailored reconstruction without training data. The proposed algorithm uses Gaussian process regression to optimize INR hyperparameters, accommodating various acquisitions. The INR includes a trainable positional encoder for high-dimensional feature embedding and a small multilayer perceptron for decoding. The bilevel optimization is computationally efficient, requiring only a few minutes per typical 2D Cartesian scan. On scanner hardware, the subsequent scan-specific reconstruction-using offline-optimized hyperparameters-is completed within seconds and achieves improved image quality compared to previous model-based and self-supervised learning methods.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Transfer based Evolutionary Deep Neural Network for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A faster response with commendable accuracy in intelligent systems is essential for the reliability and smooth operations of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of such intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and (ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100% for most of the operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Graph Signal Sampling by Difference-of-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a desigining method of a flexible sampling operator for graph signals via a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization algorithm. A fundamental challenge in graph signal processing is sampling, especially for graph signals that are not bandlimited. In order to sample beyond bandlimited graph signals, there are studies to expand the generalized sampling theory for the graph setting. Vertex-wise sampling and flexible sampling are two main strategies to sample graph signals. Recovery accuracy of existing vertex-wise sampling methods is highly dependent on specific vertices selected to generate a sampled graph signal that may compromise the accurary especially when noise is generated at the vertices. In contrast, a flexible sampling mixes values at multiple vertices to generate a sampled signal for robust sampling; however, existing flexible sampling methods impose strict assumptions and aggressive relaxations. To address these limitations, we aim to design a flexible sampling operator without such strict assumptions and aggressive relaxations by introducing DC optimization. By formulating the problem of designing a flexible sampling operator as a DC optimization problem, our method ensures robust sampling for graph signals under arbitrary priors based on generalized sampling theory. We develop an efficient solver based on the general double-proximal gradient DC algorithm, which guarantees convergence to a critical point. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in sampling and recovering beyond bandlimited graph signals compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Autoencoders for Reducing PAPR in Coherent Optical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to mitigating the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The proposed method uses a deep learning model called autoencoders (AEs) to simplify the process and avoid the complex calculations of traditional methods such as selective mapping (SLM). Unlike SLM, our approach does not need side information about the PAPR distribution. Through simulations of coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems, the AE-based model offers substantial enhancements in both PAPR reduction and bit error rate (BER) performance when compared to conventional techniques. An error-free transmission can be acheived with a reduction in PAPR exceeding 10 dB compared to the original signal and a 1 dB advantage over SLM. In particular, the AE model achieves the best BER performance of \(2 \times 10^{-6}\) at 44 dB OSNR, surpassing traditional methods. Furthermore, the model demonstrates robustness against noise and nonlinear distortions, making it appropriate for optical channels experiencing diverse levels of impairment. This innovative technique has the potential to revolutionize next-generation optical communication systems by enabling efficient and reliable data transmission.</description>

      <title>Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</description>

      <title>Distributed Blind Source Separation based on FastICA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), many traditional signal processing tasks are required to be computed in a distributed fashion, without transmissions of the raw data to a centralized processing unit, due to the limited energy and bandwidth resources available to the sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm, which aims at identifying the original signal sources based on observations of their mixtures measured at various sensor nodes. One of the most commonly used ICA algorithms is known as FastICA, which requires a spatial pre-whitening operation in the first step of the algorithm. Such a pre-whitening across all nodes of a WSN is impossible in a bandwidth-constrained distributed setting as it requires to correlate each channel with each other channel in the WSN. We show that an explicit network-wide pre-whitening step can be circumvented by leveraging the properties of the so-called Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) framework. Despite the lack of such a network-wide pre-whitening, we can still obtain the $Q$ least Gaussian independent components of the centralized ICA solution, where $Q$ scales linearly with the required communication load.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for the Multi-User MIMO Uplink</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers exhibit great potential in assisting classical wireless communications due to their outstanding advantages in detecting radio frequency signals. To realize this potential, we integrate a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver into a classical multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme to form a multi-user Rydberg atomic quantum MIMO (RAQ-MIMO) system for the uplink. To study this system, we first construct an equivalent baseband signal model, which facilitates convenient system design, signal processing and optimizations. We then study the ergodic achievable rates under both the maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) schemes by deriving their tight lower bounds. We next compare the ergodic achievable rates of the RAQ-MIMO and the conventional massive MIMO schemes by offering a closed-form expression for the difference of their ergodic achievable rates, which allows us to directly compare the two systems. Our results show that RAQ-MIMO allows the average transmit power of users to be $&gt; 25$ dBm lower than that of the conventional massive MIMO. Viewed from a different perspective, an extra $\sim 8.8$ bits/s/Hz/user rate becomes achievable by ZF RAQ-MIMO.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Non-uniform Quantization for Enhanced ILC in Wideband Digital Pre-distortion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, it is identified that lowering the reference level at the vector signal analyzer can significantly improve the performance of iterative learning control (ILC). We present a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon, where the signals experience logarithmic transform prior to analogue-to-digital conversion, resulting in non-uniform quantization. This process reduces the quantization noise of low-amplitude signals that constitute a substantial portion of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, thereby improving ILC performance. Measurement results show that compared to setting the reference level to the peak amplitude, lowering the reference level achieves 3 dB improvement on error vector magnitude (EVM) and 15 dB improvement on normalized mean square error (NMSE) for 320 MHz WiFi OFDM signals.</description>

      <title>Toward Foundational Model for Sleep Analysis Using a Multimodal Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Timely Status Updates in Slotted ALOHA Networks With Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the age of information (AoI) in a scenario where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a gateway following the slotted ALOHA protocol and receive no feedback. We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Inverse Design of Band-Tunable Mechanical Metastructures for Tailored Vibration Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-demand vibration mitigation in a mechanical system needs the suitable design of multiscale metastructures, involving complex unit cells. In this study, immersing in the world of patterns and examining the structural details of some interesting motifs are extracted from the mechanical metastructure perspective. Nine interlaced metastructures are fabricated using additive manufacturing, and corresponding vibration characteristics are studied experimentally and numerically. Further, the band-gap modulation with metallic inserts in the honeycomb interlaced metastructures is also studied. AI-driven inverse design of such complex metastructures with a desired vibration mitigation profile can pave the way for addressing engineering challenges in high-precision manufacturing. The current inverse design methodologies are limited to designing simple periodic structures based on limited variants of unit cells. Therefore, a novel forward analysis model with multi-head FEM-inspired spatial attention (FSA) is proposed to learn the complex geometry of the metastructures and predict corresponding transmissibility. Subsequently, a multiscale Gaussian self-attention (MGSA) based inverse design model with Gaussian function for 1D spectrum position encoding is developed to produce a suitable metastructure for the desired vibration transmittance. The proposed AI framework demonstrated outstanding performance corresponding to the expected locally resonant bandgaps in a targeted frequency range.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting based on optimized LLM for fault prediction in distribution power grid insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</description>
