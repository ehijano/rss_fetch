      <title>Non-trivial Integer Solutions of $x^r+y^r=Dz^p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the modular method together with some standard conjectures to prove that infinitely many equations of the type $x^r+y^r=Dz^p$ do not have any non-trivial primitive integer solutions, where $r&gt;5$ is a fixed prime, whenever $p$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>On the Borisov-Gunnells relations for products of Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borisov and Gunnells have proved that certain linear combinations of products of Eisenstein series are Eisenstein series themselves, in analogy with the Manin 3-term relations for modular symbols. We devise a new method to determine and prove such relations, by differentiating with respect to the parameters of the Eisenstein series.</description>

      <title>Algebraic identities among $q$- analogue of Euler double zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, Zudilin presented a $q$-analogue of Euler's identity for one of the variants of $q$-double zeta function. This article focuses on exploring identities related to another variant of $q$-double zeta function and its star variant. Using a $q$-analogue of the Nielsen Reflexion Formula for $q&gt;1$, we investigate identities involving different versions of $q$-analogues of the Riemann zeta function and the double-zeta function. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of $\zeta_q(s_1, s_2)$ as $s_1$ and $s_2$ approach to $0$ and compare these limits to those of the classical double-zeta function. Finally, we discuss the $q$-analogue of the Mordell-Tornheim $r$-ple zeta function and its relation with the $q$-double zeta function.</description>

      <title>Transcendental nature of $p$-adic digamma values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed prime $p$, Murty and Saradha (2008) studied the transcendental nature of special values of the $p$-adic digamma function, denoted as $\psi_p(r/p)+ \gamma_p$. This research was later extended by Chatterjee and Gun in 2014, who investigated the case of $\psi_p(r/p^n)+ \gamma_p$, for any integer $n&gt;1$. In this article, we generalize their results for distinct prime powers and explore the transcendental nature of the $p$-adic digamma values, with at most one exception. Further, we investigate the multiplicative independence of cyclotomic numbers satisfying certain conditions. Using this, we prove the transcendental nature of $p$-adic digamma values corresponding to $\psi_p(r/pq)+ \gamma_p$, where $p, q$ are distinct primes.</description>

      <title>Zeros of $L$-Functions in Low-Lying Intervals and de Branges spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variant of a problem first introduced by Hughes and Rudnick (2003) and generalized by Bernard (2015) concerning conditional bounds for small first zeros in a family of $L$-functions. Here we seek to estimate the size of the smallest intervals centered at a low-lying height for which we can guarantee the existence of a zero in a family of $L$-functions. This leads us to consider an extremal problem in analysis which we address by applying the framework of de Branges spaces, introduced in this context by Carneiro, Chirre, and Milinovich (2022).</description>

      <title>The global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for Fourier-Jacobi periods on unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for Fourier-Jacobi periods on unitary groups and an Ichino-Ikeda type refinement. Our strategy is based on the comparison of relative trace formulae formulated by Liu. We develop the full coarse spectral and geometric expansions of the relative trace formulae, and compute relevant spectral terms via zeta integrals and truncated periods. We compare all geometric terms and characterize the local geometric comparison in terms of spectral data.</description>

      <title>Strong bounds for skew corner-free sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to matrix multiplication algorithms, Pratt asked (ITCS'24) how large a subset of $[n] \times [n]$ could be without containing a skew-corner: three points $(x,y), (x,y+h),(x+h,y')$ with $h \ne 0$. We prove any skew corner-free set has size at most $\exp(-\Omega(\log^{1/12} n))\cdot n^2$, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\exp(-O(\sqrt{\log n}))\cdot n^2$ by Beker (arXiv'24). Our techniques generalize those of Kelley and Meka's recent breakthrough on three-term arithmetic progression (FOCS'23), answering a question of Beker (arXiv'24).</description>

      <title>Generic representations, open parameters and ABV-packets for $p$-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $\pi$ is a representation of a $p$-adic group $G(F)$, and $\phi$ is its Langlands parameter, can we use the moduli space of Langlands parameters to find a geometric property of $\phi$ that will detect when $\pi$ is generic? In this paper we show that if $G$ is classical or if we assume the Kazhdan-Lusztig hypothesis for $G$, then the answer is yes, and the property is that the orbit of $\phi$ is open. We also propose an adaptation of Shahidi's enhanced genericity conjecture to ABV-packets: for every Langlands parameter $\phi$ for a $p$-adic group $G(F)$, the ABV-packet $\Pi^{\mathrm{ABV}}_\phi(G(F))$ contains a generic representation if and only if the local adjoint L-function $L(s,\phi,\mathop{\text{Ad}})$ is regular at $s=1$, and show that this condition is equivalent to the "open parameter" condition above. We show that this genericity conjecture for ABV-packets follows from other standard conjectures and we verify its validity with the same conditions on $G$. We show that, in this case, the ABV-packet for $\phi$ coincides with its $L$-packet. Finally, we prove Vogan's conjecture on $A$-packets for tempered parameters.</description>

      <title>Hook length biases in ordinary and $t$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study hook lengths of ordinary partitions and $t$-regular partitions. We establish hook length biases for the ordinary partitions and motivated by them we find a few interesting hook length biases in $2$-regular partitions. For a positive integer $k$, let $p_{(k)}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the partitions of $n$. We prove that $p_{(k)}(n)\geq p_{(k+1)}(n)$ for all $n\geq0$ and $n\ne k+1$; and $p_{(k)}(k+1)- p_{(k+1)}(k+1)=-1$ for $k\geq 2$. For integers $t\geq2$ and $k\geq1$, let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. We find generating functions of $b_{t,k}(n)$ for certain values of $t$ and $k$. Exploring hook length biases for $b_{t,k}(n)$, we observe that in certain cases biases are opposite to the biases for ordinary partitions. We prove that $b_{2,2}(n)\geq b_{2,1}(n)$ for all $n&gt;4$, whereas $b_{2,2}(n)\geq b_{2,3}(n)$ for all $n\geq 0$. Our proofs are both combinatorial and analytic in nature. We also propose some conjectures on biases among $b_{t,k}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Primality proving using elliptic curves with complex multiplication by imaginary quadratic fields of class number three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15137v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2015, Abatzoglou, Silverberg, Sutherland, and Wong presented a framework for primality proving algorithms for special sequences of integers using an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. They applied their framework to obtain algorithms for elliptic curves with complex multiplication by imaginary quadratic field of class numbers one and two, but, they were not able to obtain primality proving algorithms in cases of higher class number. In this paper, we present a method to apply their framework to imaginary quadratic fields of class number three. In particular, our method provides a more efficient primality proving algorithm for special sequences of integers than the existing algorithms by using an imaginary quadratic field of class number three in which 2 splits. As an application, we give two special sequences of integers derived from $\Q(\sqrt{-23})$ and $\Q(\sqrt{-31})$, which are all the imaginary quadratic fields of class number three in which 2 splits. Finally, we give a computational result for the primality of these sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the notion of an asymptotically automatic sequence, which generalises the notion of an automatic sequence. While $k$-automatic sequences are characterised by finiteness of $k$-kernels, the $k$-kernels of asymptotically $k$-automatic sequences are only required to be finite up to equality almost everywhere. We prove basic closure properties and a linear bound on asymptotic subword complexity, show that results concerning frequencies of symbols are no longer true for the asymptotic analogue, and discuss some classification problems.</description>

Abstract: We use Experimental Mathematics and Symbolic Computation (with Maple), to search for lots and lots of Perrin- and Lucas- style primality tests, and try to sort the wheat from the chaff. More impressively, we find quite a few such primality tests for which we can explicitly construct infinite families of pseudo-primes, rather, like in the cases of Perrin pseudo-primes and the famous Carmichael primes, only proving the mere existence of infinitely many of them.</description>

      <title>Large prime factors of well-distributed sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of large prime factors of a random element $u$ of arithmetic sequences satisfying simple regularity and equidistribution properties. We show that if such an arithmetic sequence has level of distribution $1$ the large prime factors of $u$ tend to a Poisson-Dirichlet process, while if the sequence has any positive level of distribution the correlation functions of large prime factors tend to a Poisson-Dirichlet process against test functions of restricted support. For sequences with positive level of distribution, we also estimate the probability the largest prime factor of $u$ is greater than $u^{1-\epsilon}$, showing that this probability is $O(\epsilon)$.
  Examples of sequences described include shifted primes and values of single-variable irreducible polynomials.
  The proofs involve (i) a characterization of the Poisson-Dirichlet process due to Arratia-Kochman-Miller and (ii) an upper bound sieve.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the submodularity of the covolume function in global function fields. The submodular property is often needed in the study of homogeneous dynamics, especially to define a Margulis function. We proved that the covolume function is submodular when the class group of the global function field is trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $q\geq2$ be a prime power and consider Drinfeld modules of rank 2 over $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$. We prove that there are no points with coordinates being Drinfeld singular moduli, on a family of hyperbolas $XY=\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is a polynomial of small degree. This is an effective Andr\'e-Oort theorem for these curves. We also prove that there are at most finitely many Drinfeld singular moduli that are algebraic units, for every fixed $q\geq2$, and we give an effective bound on the discriminant of such singular moduli. We give in an appendix an inseparability criterion for values of some classical modular forms, generalising an argument used in the proof of our first result.</description>

Abstract: Let $j\geq 2$ be a given integer. Let $f$ be a normalized primitive holomorphic cusp form of even integral weight for the full modular group $\Gamma=SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. Denote by $\lambda_{\text{sym}^{j}f}(n)$ the $n$th normalized coefficient of the Dirichlet expansion of the $j$th symmetric power $L$-function $L(s,\text{sym}^{j}f)$. In this paper, we are interested in the behavior of the shifted convolution sum involving $\lambda_{\text{sym}^{j}f}(n)$ with a weight function to be the $k$-full kernel function for any fixed integer $k\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Monogenic Quartic Polynomials and Their Galois Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A monic polynomial $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ of degree $N$ is called monogenic if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots ,\theta^{N-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$. In this article, we use the classification of the Galois groups of quartic polynomials, due to Kappe and Warren, to investigate the existence of infinite collections of monogenic quartic polynomials having a prescribed Galois group, such that each member of the collection generates a distinct quartic field. With the exception of the cyclic case, we provide such an infinite single-parameter collection for each possible Galois group. We believe these examples are new, and we provide evidence to support this belief by showing that they are distinct from other infinite collections in the current literature. Finally, we devote a separate section to a discussion concerning, what we believe to be, the still-unresolved cyclic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate Vojta's conjecture for smooth weighted projective varieties, weighted multiplier ideal sheaves, and weighted log pairs and prove that all three versions of the conjecture are equivalent. In the process, we introduce generalized weighted general common divisors and express them as heights of weighted projective spaces blown-up relative to an exceptional divisor. Furthermore, we prove that assuming Vojta's conjecture for weighted projective varieties one can bound the $\log {\rm h_{wgcd}}$ for any subvariety of codimension $\geq 2$ and a finite set of places $S$. An analogue result is proved for weighted homogeneous polynomials with integer coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>
