      <title>Reliable Interval Prediction of Minimum Operating Voltage Based on On-chip Monitors via Conformalized Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) of chips is one of the important techniques for improving the manufacturing testing flow, as well as ensuring the long-term reliability and safety of in-field systems. Current $V_{min}$ prediction methods often provide only point estimates, necessitating additional techniques for constructing prediction confidence intervals to cover uncertainties caused by different sources of variations. While some existing techniques offer region predictions, but they rely on certain distributional assumptions and/or provide no coverage guarantees. In response to these limitations, we propose a novel distribution-free $V_{min}$ interval estimation methodology possessing a theoretical guarantee of coverage. Our approach leverages conformalized quantile regression and on-chip monitors to generate reliable prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on an industrial 5nm automotive chip dataset. Moreover, we show that the use of on-chip monitors can reduce the interval length significantly for $V_{min}$ prediction.</description>

      <title>Translation of Nagumo's Foundational Work on Barrier Functions: On the Location of Integral Curves of Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1942, Prof. Mitio Nagumo published his seminal paper on the location of integral curves of ordinary differential equations. Nagumo's paper provides the foundation of the set invariance of ordinary differential equations and barrier functions, which have recently gained popularity for the control design of safety critical dynamical systems. This translation shall serve the community with an easily accessible version of the original 1942 paper in English. A copy of Nagumo's paper in German is also attached as a reference. That copy was created by the Boeing Company, Germany, in an attempt to improve pdf format readability of the original paper.</description>

      <title>Data-driven identification of port-Hamiltonian DAE systems by Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS) allow for a structure-preserving modeling of dynamical systems. Coupling pHS via linear relations between input and output defines an overall pHS, which is structure preserving. However, in multiphysics applications, some subsystems do not allow for a physical pHS description, as (a) this is not available or (b) too expensive. Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way. In this work, we derive a data-driven identification approach for port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes. We apply this approach successfully to two applications from network design and constrained multibody system dynamics, based on pH-DAE system of index one and three, respectively.</description>

      <title>State and Input Constrained Output-Feedback Adaptive Optimal Control of Affine Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel online, output-feedback, critic-only, model-based reinforcement learning framework is developed for safety-critical control systems operating in complex environments. The developed framework ensures system stability and safety, regardless of the lack of full-state measurement, while learning and implementing an optimal controller. The approach leverages linear matrix inequality-based observer design method to efficiently search for observer gains for effective state estimation. Then, approximate dynamic programming is used to develop an approximate controller that uses simulated experiences to guarantee the safety and stability of the closed-loop system. Safety is enforced by adding a recentered robust Lyapunov-like barrier function to the cost function that effectively enforces safety constraints, even in the presence of uncertainty in the state. Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to guarantee uniform ultimate boundedness of the trajectories of the closed-loop system and ensure safety. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method through two real-world safety-critical scenarios, ensuring that the state trajectories of a given system remain in a given set and obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <title>A Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Model for Long-Term Reliability of Aging Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrity and reliability of a national power grid system are essential to society's development and security. Among the power grid components, transmission lines are critical due to exposure and vulnerability to severe external conditions, including high winds, ice, and extreme temperatures. The combined effects of external agents with high electrical load and presence of damage precursors greatly affects the conducting material's properties due to a thermal runaway cycle that accelerates the aging process. In this paper, we develop a thermo-electro-mechanical model for long-term failure analysis of overhead transmission lines. A phase-field model of damage and fatigue, coupled with electrical and thermal modules, provides a detailed description of the conductor's temperature evolution. We define a limit state function based on maximum operating temperature to avoid excessive overheating and sagging. We study four representative scenarios deterministically, and propose the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) as a tool to understand the stochastic behavior of the system. We use PCM in forward parametric uncertainty quantification, global sensitivity analysis, and computation of failure probability curves in a straightforward and computationally efficient fashion, and we quantify the most influential parameters that affect the failure predictability from a physics-based perspective.</description>

      <title>Verification and Synthesis of Compatible Control Lyapunov and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety and stability are essential properties of control systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) have been proposed to ensure safety and stability respectively. However, previous approaches typically verify and synthesize the CBFs and CLFs separately, satisfying their respective constraints, without proving that the CBFs and CLFs are compatible with each other, namely at every state, there exists control actions that satisfy both the CBF and CLF constraints simultaneously. There exists some recent works that synthesized compatible CLF and CBF, but relying on nominal polynomial or rational controllers, which is just a sufficient but not necessary condition for compatibility. In this work, we investigate verification and synthesis of compatible CBF and CLF independent from any nominal controllers. We derive exact necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility, and further formulate Sum-Of-Squares program for the compatibility verification. Based on our verification framework, we also design an alternating nominal-controller-free synthesis method. We evaluate our method in a linear toy, a non-linear toy, and a power converter example.</description>

      <title>Generalized Averaging Method for Power Electronics Modeling from DC to above Half the Switching Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling power electronic converters at frequencies close to or above half the switching frequency has been difficult due to the time-variant and discontinuous switching actions. This paper uses the properties of moving Fourier coefficients to develop the generalized averaging method, breaking though the limit of half the switching frequency. The paper also proposes the generalized average model for various switching signals, including pulse-width modulation (PWM), phase-shift modulation, pulse-frequency modulation (PFM), and state-dependent switching signals, so that circuits and modulators/controllers can be modeled separately and combined flexibly. Using the Laplace transform of moving Fourier coefficients, the coupling of signals and their sidebands at different frequencies is clearly described as the coupling of moving Fourier coefficients at the same frequency in a linear time-invariant system framework. The modeling method is applied to a PWM controlled boost converter, a V2 constant on-time controlled buck converter, and a PFM controlled LLC converter, for demonstration and validation. Experimental results of the converters in different operating modes show that the proposed models have higher accuracy than exiting models, especially in the frequency range close to or above half the switching frequency. The developed method can be applied to almost all types of power electronic converters.</description>

      <title>Distributed Utility Optimization in Vehicular Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of utility maximization in the uplink of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems. The studied scenarios consider four practical aspects of mobile radio communication links: i) Interference between adjacent channels, ii) interference between roadside units along the way, iii) fast and slow channel fadings, and iv) Doppler shift effects. We present first the system model for the IEEE 802.11p standard, which considers a communication network between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Next, we formulate the problem of utility maximization in the network, and propose a distributed optimization scheme. This distributed scheme is based on a two-loop feedback configuration, where an outer-loop establishes the optimal signal to interference-noise ratio (SINR) that maximizes the utility function per vehicle and defines a quality-of-service objective. Meanwhile, inner-control loops adjust the transmission power to achieve this optimal SINR reference in each vehicle node regardless of interference, time-varying channel profiles and network latency. The computation complexity of the distributed utility maximization scheme is analyzed for each feedback loop. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reaches the objective SINRs that maximize utility and improve energy efficiency in the network with a low time cost. The results also show that the maximum utility is consistently achieved for different propagation scenarios inside the vehicular communication network.</description>

      <title>Parameter Dependent Chen--Fliess Series and Their Nonrecursive Interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of parameter dependent Chen--Fliess series is introduced where the series coefficients are taken from a noncommutative ring of multivariable differential operators. Such series are shown in the linear case to represent formal solutions to Cauchy initial value problems for nonhomogeneous PDEs and thus are useful for characterizing the input-output maps of distributed control systems. It is also shown that this class of functional series is almost closed under the set of nonrecursive interconnections, that is, any finite combination of parallel and series interconnections without a closed-loop. Some sufficient conditions are needed for the series interconnection. Specific examples are given involving the transport equation and the wave equation.</description>

      <title>In-situ Controller Autotuning by Bayesian Optimization for Closed-loop Feedback Control of Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-loop control of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled the production of complex, high-criticality parts for various industries. This method relies on static parameter sets from extensive experimentation and simulations, hoping they remain stable and defect-free in production. Closed-loop control of LPBF can further enhance process stability and reduce defects despite complex thermal histories, process noise, hardware drift, and unexpected perturbations. Controller performance depends on parameter tuning, traditionally a manual, expertise-driven process with no guarantee of optimal performance and limited transferability between systems. This study proposes Bayesian Optimization (BO) to automate in-layer controller tuning by leveraging LPBF's layer-to-layer repetitive nature. Two approaches are introduced: online tuning, adjusting parameters iteratively during the process, and offline tuning, conducted in a setup such as laser exposures on a bare metal plate. These methods are experimentally implemented on an in-layer PI controller, and the performance is investigated on two wedge geometries prone to overheating. Results show that BO effectively tunes controllers using either method, significantly reducing overheating in controlled wedge specimens compared to uncontrolled ones. This study presents the first printed parts controlled by an in-layer controller subjected to microstructural analysis. Findings reveal partial presence of lack-of-fusion porosities due to insufficient laser power assigned by the controller, highlighting a significant challenge for utilizing laser power controllers. In summary, BO presents a promising method for automatic in-layer controller tuning in LPBF, enhancing control precision and mitigating overheating in production parts.</description>

      <title>OCC-MP: A Max-Pressure framework to prioritize transit and high occupancy vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-pressure (MP) is a decentralized adaptive traffic signal control approach that has been shown to maximize throughput for private vehicles. However, MP-based signal control algorithms do not differentiate the movement of transit vehicles from private vehicles or between high and single-occupancy private vehicles. Prioritizing the movement of transit or other high occupancy vehicles (HOVs) is vital to reduce congestion and improve the reliability and efficiency of transit operations. This study proposes OCC-MP: a novel MP-based algorithm that considers both vehicle queues and passenger occupancies in computing the weights of movements. By weighing movements with higher passenger occupancies more heavily, transit and other HOVs are implicitly provided with priority, while accounting for any negative impacts of that priority on single occupancy vehicles. And, unlike rule-based transit signal priority (TSP) strategies, OCC-MP more naturally also accommodates conflicting transit routes at a signalized intersection and facilitates their movement, even in mixed traffic without dedicated lanes. Simulations on a grid network under varying demands and transit configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC-MP at providing TSP while simultaneously reducing the negative impact imparted onto lower occupancy private vehicles. Furthermore, OCC-MP is shown to have a larger stable region for demand compared to rule-based TSP strategies integrated into the MP framework. The performance of OCC-MP is also shown to be robust to errors in passenger occupancy information from transit vehicles and can be applied when passenger occupancies of private vehicles are not available. Finally, OCC-MP can be applied in a partially connected vehicle (CV) environment when a subset of vehicles is able to provide information to the signal controller, outperforming baseline methods at low CV penetration rates.</description>

      <title>A Max Pressure Algorithm for Traffic Signals Considering Pedestrian Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel max-pressure (MP) algorithm that incorporates pedestrian traffic into the MP control architecture. Pedestrians are modeled as being included in one of two groups: those walking on sidewalks and those queued at intersections waiting to cross. Traffic dynamics models for both groups are developed. Under the proposed control policy, the signal timings are determined based on the queue length of both vehicles and pedestrians waiting to cross the intersection. The proposed algorithm maintains the decentralized control structure, and the paper proves that it also exhibits the maximum stability property for both vehicles and pedestrians. Microscopic traffic simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the overall operational efficiency -- i.e., reduce person travel delays -- under various vehicle demand levels compared to the original queue-based MP (Q-MP) algorithm and a recently developed rule-based MP algorithm considering pedestrians. The Q-MP ignores the yielding behavior of right-turn vehicles to conflicting pedestrian movements, which leads to high delay for vehicles. On the other hand, the delay incurred by pedestrians is high from the rule-based model since it imposes large waiting time tolerance to guarantee the operational efficiency of vehicles. The proposed algorithm outperforms both models since the states of both vehicles and pedestrians are taken into consideration to determine signal timings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach based on robust stability concepts and tools is introduced to evaluate the unconditional stability of microwave active $\textit{n}$-port devices. An efficient calculation of the Structured Singular Value of the $\textit{n}$x$\textit{n}$ scattering matrix is proposed to obtain the stability characteristics of the device. The presented method is validated in two ways. First, it is applied to a referential 4x4 scattering parameter set for independent verification. Second, the method is applied to a 4-port GaAs FET amplifier fabricated in hybrid technology. The results confirm the validity and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optical systems send and receive ultra-short temporal pulses (USP). While ultra-broad band antennas do exist in the microwave region (e.g., log-periodic antennas, or, concentric loop antennas), their short temporal response is typically limited by the antenna's large dispersion, hence, resulting in a substantial pulse broadening. Here we show that loop antennas may exhibit USP attributes, below 400 ps (or, an equivalent coherent band pass exceeding 2.5 GHz) with only three loops, or, with a single, thick loop.</description>

      <title>Markov Decision Process and Approximate Dynamic Programming for a Patient Assignment Scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Patient Assignment Scheduling (PAS) problem in a random environment that arises in the management of patient flow in the hospital systems, due to the stochastic nature of the arrivals as well as the Length of Stay distribution. We develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which aims to assign the newly arrived patients in an optimal way so as to minimise the total expected long-run cost per unit time over an infinite horizon. We assume Poisson arrival rates that depend on patient types, and Length of Stay distributions that depend on whether patients stay in their primary wards or not. Since the instances of realistic size of this problem are not easy to solve, we develop numerical methods based on Approximate Dynamic Programming. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples with parameters obtained by fitting to data from a tertiary referral hospital in Australia, and demonstrate the application potential of our methodology under practical considerations.</description>

Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing a major transformation as they integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and batteries to smooth out variations in renewable energy production. As privately-owned batteries grow from their role as marginal "price-takers" to significant players in the market, a natural question arises: How do batteries operate in electricity markets, and how does the strategic behavior of decentralized batteries distort decisions compared to centralized batteries?
  We propose an analytically tractable model that captures salient features of the highly complex electricity market. We derive in closed form the resulting battery behavior and generation cost in three operating regimes: (i) no battery, (ii) centralized battery, and (ii) decentralized profit-maximizing battery. We establish that a decentralized battery distorts its discharge decisions in three ways. First, there is quantity withholding, i.e., discharging less than centrally optimal. Second, there is a shift in participation from day-ahead to real-time, i.e., postponing some of its discharge from day-ahead to real-time. Third, there is reduction in real-time responsiveness, or discharging less in response to smoothing real-time demand than centrally optimal. We quantify each of the three forms of distortions in terms of market fundamentals. To illustrate our results, we calibrate our model to Los Angeles and Houston and show that the loss from incentive misalignment could be consequential.</description>

Abstract: Developing and enforcing study protocols is a foundational component of medical research. As study complexity for participant interactions increases, translating study protocols to supporting application code becomes challenging. A collaboration exists between the University of Kentucky and Arizona State University to determine the efficacy of time-restricted eating in improving metabolic risk among postmenopausal women. This study utilizes a graph-based approach to monitor and support adherence to a designated schedule, enabling the validation and step-wise audit of participants' statuses to derive dependable conclusions. A texting service, driven by a participant graph, automatically manages interactions and collects data. Participant data is then accessible to the research study team via a website, which enables viewing, management, and exportation. This paper presents a system for automatically managing participants in a time-restricted eating study that eliminates time-consuming interactions with participants.</description>

      <title>An open-source Autonomous Surface Vehicle for Acoustic Tracking, Bathymetric and Photogrammetric Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) are becoming more affordable and include a wide variety of sensors and capacities with applications from ocean physics such as the Saildrone project to ecology with the tracking of marine species in the wild. Here, we present a multi-modal, affordable, open source, and reproducible ASV to track marine animal in shallow waters, collect information on bathymetry, and carry out photogrammetry surveys. The current specification enables scientists to track an animal equipped with an acoustic tag for 5~h and a spatial accuracy of 1~m. For bathymetric or photogrammetry surveys, the ASV can cover 100 x 100~m areas in 2~h with a distance of 1-m between transects. Depending on the sensors included in the ASV, it has a price ranging from \$2,434 to \$11,072. We illustrate these developments with a case study and a field survey for each of the different application proposed.</description>

      <title>A Wireless, Multicolor Fluorescence Image Sensor Implant for Real-Time Monitoring in Cancer Therapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of dynamic biological processes in the body is critical to understanding disease progression and treatment response. This data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a 2.5$\times$5 mm$^2$ CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5 cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221 mW/cm$^{2}$ incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kbps with a bit error rate &lt;$10^{-6}$. In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by micro-laser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides &gt;6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36$\times$40-pixel array captures images with &lt;125 $\mu$m resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy. These results show promise for providing rapid insight into therapeutic response and resistance, guiding personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Lithium-Ion Battery System Health Monitoring and Fault Analysis from Field Data Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Health monitoring, fault analysis, and detection are critical for the safe and sustainable operation of battery systems. We apply Gaussian process resistance models on lithium iron phosphate battery field data to effectively separate the time-dependent and operating point-dependent resistance. The data set contains 29 battery systems returned to the manufacturer for warranty, each with eight cells in series, totaling 232 cells and 131 million data rows. We develop probabilistic fault detection rules using recursive spatiotemporal Gaussian processes. These processes allow the quick processing of over a million data points, enabling advanced online monitoring and furthering the understanding of battery pack failure in the field. The analysis underlines that often, only a single cell shows abnormal behavior or a knee point, consistent with weakest-link failure for cells connected in series, amplified by local resistive heating. The results further the understanding of how batteries degrade and fail in the field and demonstrate the potential of efficient online monitoring based on data. We open-source the code and publish the large data set upon completion of the review of this article.</description>

      <title>Oligopoly Game Stabilisation Through Multilayer Congestion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: International trade and logistics are subject to factors including geopolitical instability, climate change, and black swan events such as the unforeseen closure of the Suez Canal. The problem of predicting local price change under modification of an underlying transport network or change in supply characteristics unites elements of game theory, network theory and transport. The Cournot Oligopoly models economic actors as rational players attempting to maximise profit by optimising supply quantities with analytical results now consolidated about equilibrium characteristics where transport conditions are fixed. Similarly, where supply and demand are fixed, the routing of goods in a transport network can be analytically solved through a traffic assignment problem. Hence we can solve the coupled Cournot-congestion problem by means of a 2-layer network. Where the layers are linked, inter-layer feedback wherein players attempt to maximise their utility occurs. In this respect we find players benefit from taking advantage of non-simultaneous responses to the market rather than moving to a new equilibrium. We draw conclusions about the nature of equilibria, finding that the concave utility curve property results in unique and stable equilibrium for each uncoupled layer, while linked layers have a non-unique stable equilibria for which general solutions are stated.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents analysis results of the operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) that combine feedforward paths and multistage amplifiers to achieve high-gain wideband operation as well as frequency compensation. To analyze multistage feedforward OTAs and provide an intuitive design method, the single-pole approximation model is employed for each substage of the OTA. Using the single-pole approximation model, the analysis is carried out from the two-stage OTA to the four-stage OTA in this work.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian-based online safe reinforcement learning for state-constrained systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that approximately solves the state-constrained optimal control problem for continuous-time uncertain nonlinear systems. We formulate the safe RL problem as the minimization of a Lagrangian that includes the cost functional and a user-defined barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) encoding the state constraints. We show that the analytical solution obtained by the application of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions contains a state-dependent expression for the Lagrange multiplier, which is a function of uncertain terms in the system dynamics. We argue that a naive estimation of the Lagrange multiplier may lead to safety constraint violations. To obviate this challenge, we propose an Actor-Critic-Identifier-Lagrangian (ACIL) algorithm that learns optimal control policies from online data without compromising safety. We provide safety and boundedness guarantees with the proposed algorithm and compare its performance with existing offline/online RL methods via a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Efficient Interaction-Aware Interval Analysis of Neural Network Feedback Loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for interval reachability of systems with neural network controllers. Our approach leverages inclusion functions for the open-loop system and the neural network controller to embed the closed-loop system into a larger-dimensional embedding system, where a single trajectory over-approximates the original system's behavior under uncertainty. We propose two methods for constructing closed-loop embedding systems, which account for the interactions between the system and the controller in different ways. The interconnection-based approach considers the worst-case evolution of each coordinate separately by substituting the neural network inclusion function into the open-loop inclusion function. The interaction-based approach uses novel Jacobian-based inclusion functions to capture the first-order interactions between the open-loop system and the controller by leveraging state-of-the-art neural network verifiers. Finally, we implement our approach in a Python framework called ReachMM to demonstrate its efficiency and scalability on benchmarks and examples ranging to $200$ state dimensions.</description>

      <title>Estimating True Beliefs in Opinion Dynamics with Social Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social networks often exert social pressure, causing individuals to adapt their expressed opinions to conform to their peers. An agent in such systems can be modeled as having a (true and unchanging) inherent belief while broadcasting a declared opinion at each time step based on her inherent belief and the past declared opinions of her neighbors. An important question in this setting is parameter estimation: how to disentangle the effects of social pressure to estimate inherent beliefs from declared opinions. This is useful for forecasting when agents' declared opinions are influenced by social pressure while real-world behavior only depends on their inherent beliefs. To address this, Jadbabaie et al. formulated the Interacting P\'olya Urn model of opinion dynamics under social pressure and studied it on complete-graph social networks using an aggregate estimator, and found that their estimator converges to the inherent beliefs unless majority pressure pushes the network to consensus.
  In this work, we studythis model on arbitrary networks, providing an estimator which converges to the inherent beliefs even in consensus situations. Finally, we bound the convergence rate of our estimator in both consensus and non-consensus scenarios; to get the bound for consensus scenarios (which converge slower than non-consensus) we additionally found how quickly the system converges to consensus.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for Load Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the load flow study is to ensure that electrical power is delivered efficiently and reliably to end-users while maintaining the stability and security of the power system. Newton-Raphson is a numerical method used widely for load flow analysis. One of the most computationally expensive steps in this method is an equation-solving step. We propose to replace this step with HHL, a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations. HHL is exponentially faster, but with caveats.
  In this study, a hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed for solving load flow. The Newton-Raphson method is used as a benchmark to compare the performance of the hybrid quantum algorithm. Although the simulation of the hybrid quantum algorithm takes much time, these preliminary results are encouraging and point to the potential for the use of quantum algorithms to develop hybrid quantum algorithms for load flow analysis and related problems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Two-degree-of-freedom Beam for Rotational Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a two-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric energy harvester designed to harness rotational motion as an energy source. The harvester is built using a cut-out beam, which enables the first two resonant frequencies to be closely located in the low-frequency range. A distributed continuous model is developed and validated with experimental results. As the beam undergoes significant displacement due to rotational excitations, the geometric nonlinearity arising from longitudinal displacement is considered in the model to enhance its accuracy. It is observed that as the rotating speed increases, the increased centrifugal force causes the first resonant frequency to rise while the second resonant frequency decreases. The rotation-specific mode veering and the interchange of the first two modes are discussed. This study explores the potential to expand the bandwidth of the harvester using two types of nonlinear external force, namely mechanical stoppers and magnetic force. The results indicate that the proposed harvester can broaden the bandwidth of the first and second resonant frequencies. This research addresses the gap of combining multimodal and nonlinear force methods in rotation-al piezoelectric energy harvesting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for non-myopic sensor management for Bernoulli filtering, i.e., when there may be at most one target present in the scene. The algorithm is based on selecting the action that solves a Bellman-type minimisation problem, whose cost function is the mean square generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) error, over a future time window. We also propose an implementation of the sensor management algorithm based on an upper bound of the mean square GOSPA error and a Gaussian single-target posterior. Finally, we develop a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find an approximate optimal action within a given computational budget. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated via simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinating a high number of flexibility providing units (e.g. to provide ancillary services for the transmission system) across various grid layers requires new control concepts. A flexibility request at a point of common coupling can be met by utilizing a cascaded control structure based on online feedback optimization. In this paper the influence of the parameterization of the individual controllers on the performance of the hierarchical flexibility provision is studied on a three-level test system. The results show a high interdependency between the choice of control parameters of one controller and the behavior of other controllers as well as a significant impact on the accuracy and speed of flexibility provision. With a careful tuning, a cascaded structure based on online feedback optimization can achieve efficient vertical coordination of flexibility providing units.</description>

      <title>AeroTraj: Trajectory Planning for Fast, and Accurate 3D Reconstruction Using a Drone-based LiDAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.08634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents AeroTraj, a system that enables fast, accurate, and automated reconstruction of 3D models of large buildings using a drone-mounted LiDAR. LiDAR point clouds can be used directly to assemble 3D models if their positions are accurately determined. AeroTraj uses SLAM for this, but must ensure complete and accurate reconstruction while minimizing drone battery usage. Doing this requires balancing competing constraints: drone speed, height, and orientation. AeroTraj exploits building geometry in designing an optimal trajectory that incorporates these constraints. Even with an optimal trajectory, SLAM's position error can drift over time, so AeroTraj tracks drift in-flight by offloading computations to the cloud and invokes a re-calibration procedure to minimize error. AeroTraj can reconstruct large structures with centimeter-level accuracy and with an average end-to-end latency below 250 ms, significantly outperforming the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: The convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is known to produce good solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem in Euclidean spaces, but it has not been extended to the non-Euclidean case. The proposed adaptation uses multidimensional scaling to first project the points into a Euclidean space, thereby enabling the generation of the convex hull that initializes the algorithm. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, non-Euclidean spaces are created by adding impassable separators to the TSPLIB benchmark data-set, or by using the L1 norm as a metric. This adapted heuristic is demonstrated to outperform the commonly used Nearest Neighbor heuristic and Nearest Insertion heuristic in 89% and 99% of the cases studied, respectively. When the genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithms are provided 1 minute of computation time, the proposed heuristic tour costs are lower than the mean metaheuristic solutions found in 87% and 95% of the instances, respectively.</description>

      <title>Control-Oriented Deep Space Communications For Unmanned Space Exploration</title>

Abstract: In unmanned space exploration, the cooperation among space robots requires advanced communication techniques. In this paper, we propose a communication optimization scheme for a specific cooperation system named the "mother-daughter system". In this setup, the mother spacecraft orbits the planet, while daughter probes are distributed across the planetary surface. During each control cycle, the mother spacecraft senses the environment, computes control commands and distributes them to daughter probes for actions. They synergistically form sensing-communication-computing-control ($\mathbf{SC^3}$) loops. Given the indivisibility of the $\mathbf{SC^3}$ loop, we optimize the mother-daughter downlink for closed-loop control. The optimization objective is the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost, and the optimization parameters are the block length and transmit power. To solve the nonlinear mixed-integer problem, we first identify the optimal block length and then transform the power allocation problem into a tractable convex problem. We further derive the approximate closed-form solutions for the proposed scheme and two communication-oriented schemes: the max-sum rate scheme and the max-min rate scheme. On this basis, we analyze their power allocation principles. In particular, for time-insensitive control tasks, we find that the proposed scheme demonstrates equivalence to the max-min rate scheme. These findings are verified through simulations.</description>

      <title>System Identification for Continuous-time Linear Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: The problem of system identification for the Kalman filter, relying on the expectation-maximization (EM) procedure to learn the underlying parameters of a dynamical system, has largely been studied assuming that observations are sampled at equally-spaced time points. However, in many applications this is a restrictive and unrealistic assumption. This paper addresses system identification for the continuous-discrete filter, with the aim of generalizing learning for the Kalman filter by relying on a solution to a continuous-time It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the latent state and covariance dynamics. We introduce a novel two-filter, analytical form for the posterior with a Bayesian derivation, which yields analytical updates which do not require the forward-pass to be pre-computed. Using this analytical and efficient computation of the posterior, we provide an EM procedure which estimates the parameters of the SDE, naturally incorporating irregularly sampled measurements. Generalizing the learning of latent linear dynamical systems (LDS) to continuous-time may extend the use of the hybrid Kalman filter to data which is not regularly sampled or has intermittent missing values, and can extend the power of non-linear system identification methods such as switching LDS (SLDS), which rely on EM for the linear discrete-time Kalman filter as a sub-unit for learning locally linearized behavior of a non-linear system. We apply the method by learning the parameters of a latent, multivariate Fokker-Planck SDE representing a toggle-switch genetic circuit using biologically realistic parameters, and compare the efficacy of learning relative to the discrete-time Kalman filter as the step-size irregularity and spectral-radius of the dynamics-matrix increases.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Machine-Learning-Based Optimization Using Input Convex LSTM</title>

Abstract: Neural network-based optimization and control have gradually supplanted first-principles model-based approaches in energy and manufacturing systems due to their efficient, data-driven process modeling that requires fewer resources. However, their non-convex nature significantly slows down the optimization and control processes, limiting their application in real-time decision-making processes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Input Convex Long Short-Term Memory (ICLSTM) network to enhance the computational efficiency of neural network-based optimization. Through two case studies employing real-time neural network-based optimization for optimizing energy and chemical systems, we demonstrate the superior performance of ICLSTM-based optimization in terms of runtime. Specifically, in a real-time optimization problem of a real-world solar photovoltaic (PV) energy system at LHT Holdings in Singapore, ICLSTM-based optimization achieved an 8-fold speedup compared to conventional LSTM-based optimization. These results highlight the potential of ICLSTM networks to significantly enhance the efficiency of neural network-based optimization and control in practical applications.

Abstract: Model-free control strategies such as reinforcement learning have shown the ability to learn control strategies without requiring an accurate model or simulator of the world. While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer.

      <title>Revisiting Kinetic Monte Carlo Algorithms for Time-dependent Processes: from open-loop control to feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03997</link>

Abstract: Simulating stochastic systems with feedback control is challenging due to the complex interplay between the system's dynamics and the feedback-dependent control protocols. We present a single-step-trajectory probability analysis to time-dependent stochastic systems. Based on this analysis, we revisit several time-dependent kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms designed for systems under open-loop-control protocols. Our analysis provides an unified alternative proof to these algorithms, summarized into a pedagogical tutorial. Moreover, with the trajectory probability analysis, we present a novel feedback-controlled KMC algorithm that accurately captures the dynamics systems controlled by external signal based on measurements of the system's state. Our method correctly captures the system dynamics and avoids the artificial Zeno effect that arises from incorrectly applying the direct Gillespie algorithm to feedback-controlled systems. This work provides a unified perspective on existing open-loop-control KMC algorithms and also offers a powerful and accurate tool for simulating stochastic systems with feedback control.</description>
