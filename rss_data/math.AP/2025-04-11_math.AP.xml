      <title>Lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on unbounded manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces, and, in particular, on all convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces. In order to do this, we also obtain log-scale lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on manifolds of uniformly bounded geometry with nonpositive and negative sectional curvatures, extending the recent works of the first two authors for compact manifolds. We are able to use these along with known $L^2$-local smoothing and new $L^2 \to L^q$ half-localized resolvent estimates to obtain our lossless bounds.</description>

      <title>On convex domains maximizing the gradient of the torsion function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the solution of $-\Delta u = 1$ on convex domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions $u =0$ on $\partial \Omega$. Our main concern is the behavior of $\|\nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}$, also known as the maximum shear stress in Elasticity Theory and first investigated by Saint Venant in 1856. We consider the two shape optimization problems $\| \nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}/ |\Omega|^{1/2}$ and $\| \nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}/ H^1( \partial \Omega)$. Numerically, the extremal domain for each functional looks a bit like the rounded letter `D'. We prove that (1) either the extremal domain does not have a $C^{2 + \varepsilon}$ boundary or (2) there exists an infinite set of points on $\partial \Omega$ where the curvature vanishes. Either scenario seems curious and is rarely encountered for such problems. The techniques are based on finding a representation of the functional using only conformal geometry and classic perturbation arguments.</description>

      <title>Existence and smoothness of density function of solution to Mckean--Vlasov Equation with general coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and smoothness of a density function to the solution of a Mckean-Vlasov equation with the aid of Malliavin calculus. We first show the existence of the density function under assumptions that the coefficients of equation are only Lipschitz continuity and satisfy a uniform elliptic condition. Furthermore, we derive a precise regularity order and bounded a priori estimate for the density function under optimal smoothness assumptions for the coefficients. Finally, we present several numerical experiments to illustrate the approximation of the density function independently determined by solving a Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ estimates for joint quasimodes of two pseudodifferential operators whose characteristic sets have $k$-th order contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a smooth, compact, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, we consider functions $u_h$ that are joint quasimodes of two semiclassical pseudodifferential operators $p_1(x,hD)$ and $p_2(x,hD)$. We develop $L^p$ estimates for $u_h$ when the characteristic sets of $p_1$ and $p_2$ meet with $k$-th order contact. This paper is the natural extension of the two-dimensional results from arXiv:1909.12559 to $n$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of existence of constrained minimizers for the focusing mass-subcritical Half-Wave equation with a defocusing mass-subcritical perturbation. We show the existence of a critical mass such that minimizers do exist for any mass larger than or equal to the critical one, and do not exist below it. At the dynamical level, in the one dimensional case, we show that the ground states are orbitally stable.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to mixed dispersion nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with coupled nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of normalized solutions for the following biharmonic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system
  \[ \begin{aligned}
  \begin{cases}
  &amp;\Delta^2u+\alpha_{1}\Delta u+\lambda u=\beta r_{1}|u|^{r_{1}-2}|v|^{r_{2}} u &amp;&amp;\text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{N},
  &amp; \Delta^2v+\alpha_{2}\Delta v+\lambda v=\beta r_{2}|u|^{r_{1}}|v|^{r_{2}-2} v &amp;&amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{N},\\ &amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}} (u^{2}+v^{2}){\rm d} x=\rho^{2},&amp;&amp;
  \end{cases} \end{aligned}
  \]
  where $\Delta^2u=\Delta(\Delta u)$ is the biharmonic operator, $\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{2}$, $\beta&gt;0$, $r_{1}$, $r_{2}&gt;1$, $N\geq 1$. $\rho^2$ stands for the prescribed mass, and $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ arises as a Lagrange multiplier. Such single constraint permits mass transformation in two materials. When $r_{1}+r_{2}\in\left(2,2+\frac{8}{N}\right]$, we obtain a dichotomy result for the existence of nontrivial ground states. Especially when $\alpha_1=\alpha_2$, the ground state exists for all $\rho&gt;0$ if and only if $r_1+r_2&lt;\min\left\{\max\left\{4, 2+\frac{8}{N+1}\right\}, 2+\frac{8}{N}\right\}$. When $r_{1}+r_{2}\in\left(2+\frac{8}{N}, \frac{2N}{(N-4)^{+}}\right)$ and $N\geq 2$, we obtain the existence of radial nontrivial mountain pass solution for small $\rho&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative uniqueness of continuation for the Schr\"odinger equation : explicit dependence on the potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a quantitative version of the usual properties related to unique continuation from an interior datum for the Schr\"odinger equation with bounded or unbounded potential. The inequalities we establish have constants that explicitly depend on the potential. We also indicate how the above-mentioned inequalities can be extended to elliptic equations with bounded or unbounded first-order derivatives. The case of unique continuation from Cauchy data is also considered.</description>

      <title>Optimization Of The Survival Threshold For Anisotropic Logistic Equations With Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a reaction diffusion problem with anisotropic diffusion and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions on the boundary of the domain. First, we prove that the parabolic problem has a unique positive, bounded solution. Then, we show that this solution converges as t tends to infinity to the unique nonnegative solution of the elliptic associated problem. The existence of the unique positive solution to this problem depends on a principal eigenvalue of a suitable linearized problem with a sign-changing weights. Next, we study the minimization of such eigenvalue with respect to the sign-changing weight, showing that there exists an optimal bang-bang weight, namely a piece-wise constant weight that takes only two values. Finally, we completely solve the problem in dimension one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present some applications of the $L^p$-$L^q$ boundedness of Fourier multipliers to PDEs on the noncommutative (or quantum) Euclidean space. More precisely, we establish $L^p$-$L^q$ norm estimates for solutions of heat, wave, and Schr\"odinger type equations with Caputo fractional derivative in the case $1 &lt; p \leq 2 \leq q &lt; \infty.$ Moreover, we obtain well-posedness of nonlinear heat and wave equations on the noncommutative Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>On the double Beltrami states in Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate double Beltrami states in the Hall magnetohydrodynamic (Hall MHD) equations. Initially, we examine the double Beltrami states as a special class of steady solutions to the ideal Hall MHD equations, which are closely related to Beltrami flows in incompressible fluid dynamics. Specifically, we classify the double Beltrami states and show that they can be derived by using the variational method as energy minimizers, subject to the conservation of two helicities. We then extend our analysis to time-dependent double Beltrami states in the viscous and resistive Hall MHD equations, exploring their exact form and stability properties.</description>

      <title>Forced Oscillations of a Spring-Mounted Body by a Viscous Liquid: Rotational Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the periodic motions of the coupled system $\mathscr S$, consisting of an incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid interacting with a structure formed by a rigid body subject to {\em undamped} elastic restoring forces and torque around its rotation axis. The motion of $\mathscr S$ is driven by the uniform flow of the liquid, far away from the body, characterized by a time-periodic velocity field, $\mathbf{V}$, of frequency $f$. We show that the corresponding set of governing equations always possesses a time-periodic weak solution of the same frequency $f$, whatever $f&gt;0$, the magnitude of $\mathbf{V}$ and the values of physical parameters. Moreover, we show that the amplitude of linear and rotational displacement is always pointwise in time uniformly bounded by one and the same constant depending on the data, regardless of whether $f$ is or is not close to a natural frequency of the structure. Thus, our result rules out the occurrence of resonant phenomena.</description>

      <title>Renormalization and blow ups for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of finite-time blow ups in the classical one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS)
  (1) i \partial_t u + u_{x x} + |u|^{2r} u = 0, u(x,0) = u_0(x)
  has been one of the central problems in the studies of the singularity formation in the PDEs.
  We revisit this problem using an approach based on the ideas borrowed from Dynamical Systems.
  To that end, we reformulate the initial value problem for (1), with r \in \mathbb{N}, r \ge 1, as a fixed point problem for a certain renormalization operator, and use the ideas of apriori bounds to prove existence of a renormalization fixed point. Existence of such fixed points leads to existence of self-similar solutions of the form
  u(x,t) = (T-t)^{-{1 \over 2 r}} U((T-t)^{-{1 \over 2}} x),
  whose L^{2 r +2}-norms are bounded up-to a finite time T and whose energy blows up at T.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\beta^2 &gt; 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing a physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and establishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative Gaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\beta^2 = 2\pi$. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for a cone multiplier. Moreover, the probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\beta^2 = 6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite surprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold at $\beta^2 =8\pi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate existence, stability, and instability of anchored rotating spiral waves in a model for geometric curve evolution. We find existence in a parameter regime limiting on a purely eikonal curve evolution. We study stability and instability both theoretically in this limiting regime and numerically, finding both oscillatory, at first convective instability, and saddle-node bifurcations. Our results in particular shed light onto instability of spiral waves in reaction-diffusion systems caused by an instability of wave trains against transverse modulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the real-valued defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) on the circle. Based on the complete integrability of mKdV, Killip-Vi\c{s}an-Zhang (2018) discovered a conserved quantity which they used to prove low regularity a priori bounds for solutions. It has been an open question if this conserved quantity can be used to define invariant measures supported at fractional Sobolev regularities. Motivated by this question, we construct probability measures supported on $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $0&lt;s&lt;1/2$ invariant under the mKdV flow. We then use the Miura transform to obtain invariant measures for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, whose supports are rougher than the white noise measure. We also obtain analogous results for the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. These invariant measures cover the lowest possible regularities for which the flows of these equations are well-posed.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the final state problem for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a critical long-range nonlinearity and a long-range linear potential. Given a prescribed asymptotic profile which is different from the free evolution, we construct a unique global solution scattering to the profile. In particular, the existence of the modified wave operators is obtained for sufficiently localized small scattering data. The class of potential includes a repulsive long-range potential with a short-range perturbation, especially the positive Coulomb potential in two and three space dimensions. The asymptotic profile is constructed by combining Yafaev's type linear modifier [38] associated with the long-range part of the potential and the nonlinear modifier introduced by Ozawa [29]. Finally, we also show that one can replace Yafaev's type modifier by Dollard's type modifier under a slightly stronger decay assumption on the long-range potential. This is the first positive result on the modified scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the case when both of the nonlinear term and the linear potential are of long-range type.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic response solutions of nonlinear plate models with nonlocal energy damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Response solutions are quasi-periodic ones with the same frequency as the forcing term. The present work is devoted to constructing response solutions for $d$-dimensional nonlinear plate models with nonlocal energy
  damping, which are closely related to damping phenomena in flight structures.
  For such models, the main characteristic is that the dissipation rate depends on the energy strength. By considering a small parameter $\epsilon$ in the domain excluding the origin and imposing a small quasi-periodic forcing with a Diophantine frequency vector, we demonstrate the persistence of the corresponding response solution. We provide an alternative approach to the contraction mapping principle (cf. [7, 33]) through a combination of reduction together with the Nash--Moser iteration technique. The reason behind this approach lies in the derivative losses caused by the nonlocal nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the linear and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a time-decaying harmonic oscillator and inverse-square potential. This model retains a form of scale invariance, and using this property, we demonstrate the asymptotic completeness of wave operators and Strichartz estimates for linear propagators.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and scattering in weighted space for nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations below the Strauss exponent without gauge-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLS) with a general homogeneous nonlinearity in dimensions up to three. We assume that the degree (i.e., power) of the nonlinearity is such that the equation is mass-subcritical and short-range. We establish global well-posedness (GWP) and scattering for small data in the standard weighted space for a class of homogeneous nonlinearities, including non-gauge-invariant ones. Additionally, we include the case where the degree is less than or equal to the Strauss exponent. When the nonlinearity is not gauge-invariant, the standard Duhamel formulation fails to work effectively in the weighted Sobolev space; for instance, the Duhamel term may not be well-defined as a Bochner integral. To address this issue, we introduce an alternative formulation that allows us to establish GWP and scattering, even in the presence of poor time continuity of the Duhamel term.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Homogenisation of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the large-scale behaviour of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a periodic structure.</description>

Abstract: A thermal convection fluid motion in the three-dimensional domain exterior to a sphere is considered. A purely conductive steady state arises due to the fluid heated from the sphere. A fractional equation system is introduced by using spectral presentation. The existence of small strong solutions in a Hilbert space is obtained. The strong solution existence implies the local stability of the steady state, which attracts asymptotically the flows evolving initially from the vector fields close to the steady state.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results for the Schr\"odinger equation cover prior work of Nakamura, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We construct examples to show these results can be saturated on the sphere, and we can improve them on the flat torus by establishing new decoupling inequalities for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>An abstract uncertainty principle with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under Wigdersons' framework and by sorting out the technical points in the recent works of Tang (\textit{J. Fourier Anal. Appl.} \textbf{31} (2025)) and Dias-Luef-Prata (\textit{J. Math. Pures Appl. (9)} \textbf{198} (2025)), we prove an abstract uncertainty principle for functions in the $L^p$ setting. An immediate consequence is a new uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform, unifying and extending many existing results. More applications are shown for PDEs, including the moment growth estimates for some linear and nonlinear dispersive equations, and a type of weighted lower bound estimate for the spacetime moment of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and heat equation inspired by the control theory.</description>

      <title>Policy iteration for the deterministic control problems -- a viscosity approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the convergence rate of policy iteration for (deterministic) optimal control problems in continuous time. To overcome the problem of ill-posedness due to lack of regularity, we consider a semi-discrete scheme by adding a viscosity term via finite differences in space. We prove that PI for the semi-discrete scheme converges exponentially fast, and provide a bound on the error induced by the semi-discrete scheme. We also consider the discrete space-time scheme, where both space and time are discretized. Convergence rate of PI and the discretization error are studied.</description>

      <title>Phenotype structuring in collective cell migration:a tutorial of mathematical models and methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populations are heterogeneous, deviating in numerous ways. Phenotypic diversity refers to the range of traits or characteristics across a population, where for cells this could be the levels of signalling, movement and growth activity, etc. Clearly, the phenotypic distribution -- and how this changes over time and space -- could be a major determinant of population-level dynamics. For instance, across a cancerous population, variations in movement, growth, and ability to evade death may determine its growth trajectory and response to therapy. In this review, we discuss how classical partial differential equation (PDE) approaches for modelling cellular systems and collective cell migration can be extended to include phenotypic structuring. The resulting non-local models -- which we refer to as phenotype-structured partial integro-differential equations (PS-PIDEs) -- form a sophisticated class of models with rich dynamics. We set the scene through a brief history of structured population modelling, and then review the extension of several classic movement models -- including the Fisher-KPP and Keller-Segel equations -- into a PS-PIDE form. We proceed with a tutorial-style section on derivation, analysis, and simulation techniques. First, we show a method to formally derive these models from underlying agent-based models. Second, we recount travelling waves in PDE models of spatial spread dynamics and concentration phenomena in non-local PDE models of evolutionary dynamics, and combine the two to deduce phenotypic structuring across travelling waves in PS-PIDE models. Third, we discuss numerical methods to simulate PS-PIDEs, illustrating with a simple scheme based on the method of lines and noting the finer points of consideration. We conclude with a discussion of future modelling and mathematical challenges.</description>
