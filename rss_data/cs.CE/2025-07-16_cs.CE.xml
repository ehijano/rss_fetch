      <title>Three-dimensional SPH modeling of brittle fracture under hydrodynamic loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional SPH computational framework is presented for modeling fluid-structure interactions with structural deformation and failure. We combine weakly compressible SPH with a pseudo-spring-based SPH solver to capture the fluid flow and deformable structures. A unified modeling approach captures the solid boundaries and fluid-structure interfaces without penalty-based contact force. The $\delta$-SPH technique improves the pressure calculations in the fluid phase, while structural damage is modeled using a pseudo-spring approach, with particle interactions limited to its neighbors. The present framework can capture the three-dimensional crack surfaces in structures without any computationally intensive crack-tracking algorithm or visibility criteria. The framework has been proven effective against existing models and experimental data, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness in simulating detailed fracture patterns and offering insights into the impact of hydrodynamic events on structural integrity.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Time-Stepping Method for 3-Body Interactions in High Performance Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex behavior of molecular systems is fundamental to fields such as physics, materials science, and biology. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial tools for studying atomic-level dynamics. This work focuses on improving the efficiency of MD simulations involving two-body and three-body interactions. Traditional two-body potentials often can not fully capture the complexity of molecular systems, making the inclusion of three-body interactions important. However, these interactions are in a cubic complexity class, compared to a quadratic one for two-body interactions, and therefore are computationally expensive, even when a cutoff distance is applied. One way to improve efficiency is to use the r-RESPA multiple time-stepping algorithm to reduce the number of three-body interaction calculations. In this work, we investigate this method in the context of High Performance Computing (HPC) methods that parallelize the calculations. In particular, we investigate a communication-reducing distributed-memory parallel method from literature and present a novel shared-memory parallel cutoff method, implemented in the particle simulation library AutoPas. The results and methods are discussed, providing insights into potential advancements in MD simulation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Differential Evolution in Tire Industry Extrusion: Leveraging Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of industrial processes remains a critical challenge, particularly when no mathematical formulation of objective functions or constraints is available. This study addresses this issue by proposing a surrogate-based, data-driven methodology for optimizing complex real-world manufacturing systems using only historical process data. Machine learning models are employed to approximate system behavior and construct surrogate models, which are integrated into a tailored metaheuristic approach: Data-Driven Differential Evolution with Multi-Level Penalty Functions and Surrogate Models, an adapted version of Differential Evolution suited to the characteristics of the studied process. The methodology is applied to an extrusion process in the tire manufacturing industry, with the goal of optimizing initialization parameters to reduce waste and production time. Results show that the surrogate-based optimization approach outperforms historical best configurations, achieving a 65\% reduction in initialization and setup time, while also significantly minimizing material waste. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-driven modeling and metaheuristic optimization for industrial processes where explicit formulations are unavailable.</description>

      <title>A Tax-Efficient Model Predictive Control Policy for Retirement Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The retirement funding problem addresses the question of how to manage a retiree's savings to provide her with a constant post-tax inflation adjusted consumption throughout her lifetime. This consists of choosing withdrawals and transfers from and between several accounts with different tax treatments, taking into account basic rules such as required minimum distributions and limits on Roth conversions, additional income, liabilities, taxes, and the bequest when the retiree dies. We develop a retirement funding policy in two steps. In the first step, we consider a simplified planning problem in which various future quantities, such as the retiree's remaining lifetime, future investment returns, and future inflation, are known. Using a simplified model of taxes, we pose this planning problem as a convex optimization problem, where we maximize the bequest subject to providing a constant inflation adjusted consumption target. Since this problem is convex, it can be solved quickly and reliably. We leverage this planning method to form a retirement funding policy that determines the actions to take each year, based on information known at that time. Each year the retiree forms a new plan for the future years, using the current account values and life expectancy, and optionally, updated information such as changes in tax rates or rules. The retiree then carries out the actions from the first year of the current plan. This update-plan-act cycle is repeated each year, a general policy called model predictive control (MPC). The MPC retirement policy reacts to the effects of uncertain investment returns and inflation, changes in the retiree's expected lifetime or external income and liabilities, and changes in tax rules and rates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPC retirement policy using Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>HKGAI-V1: Towards Regional Sovereign Large Language Model for Hong Kong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems" framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a "governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.</description>

      <title>DrafterBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Tasks Automation in Civil Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential for solving real-world problems and promise to be a solution for tasks automation in industry. However, more benchmarks are needed to systematically evaluate automation agents from an industrial perspective, for example, in Civil Engineering. Therefore, we propose DrafterBench for the comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents in the context of technical drawing revision, a representation task in civil engineering. DrafterBench contains twelve types of tasks summarized from real-world drawing files, with 46 customized functions/tools and 1920 tasks in total. DrafterBench is an open-source benchmark to rigorously test AI agents' proficiency in interpreting intricate and long-context instructions, leveraging prior knowledge, and adapting to dynamic instruction quality via implicit policy awareness. The toolkit comprehensively assesses distinct capabilities in structured data comprehension, function execution, instruction following, and critical reasoning. DrafterBench offers detailed analysis of task accuracy and error statistics, aiming to provide deeper insight into agent capabilities and identify improvement targets for integrating LLMs in engineering applications. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/Eason-Li-AIS/DrafterBench, with the test set hosted at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Eason666/DrafterBench.</description>

      <title>FinRL Contests: Benchmarking Data-driven Financial Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial reinforcement learning (FinRL) is now a practical paradigm for financial engineering. However, applying RL strategies to real-world trading tasks remains a challenge for individuals, as it is error-prone and engineering-heavy. The non-stationarity of financial data, low signal-to-noise ratios, and various market frictions require deep accumulations. Although numerous FinRL methods have been developed for tasks such as stock/crypto trading and portfolio management, the lack of standardized task definitions, real-time high-quality datasets, close-to-real market environments, and robust baselines has hindered consistent reproduction in both open-source community and FinTech industry. To bridge this gap, we organized a series of FinRL Contests from 2023 to 2025, covering a diverse range of financial tasks such as stock trading, order execution, crypto trading, and the use of large language model (LLM)-engineered signals. These contests attracted 200+ participants from 100+ institutions over 20+ countries. To encourage participations, we provided starter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments, ensemble learning, and comprehensive instructions. In this paper, we summarize these benchmarking efforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines, environment implementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and organizational insights. It guides our follow-up FinRL contests, and also provides a reference for FinAI contests alike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for generating convex approximations of complex contact models, incorporating experimentally validated models like Hunt &amp; Crossley coupled with Coulomb's law of friction alongside the principle of maximum dissipation. Our approach is robust across a wide range of stiffness values, making it suitable for both compliant surfaces and rigid approximations. We evaluate these approximations across a wide variety of test cases, detailing properties and limitations. We implement a fully differentiable solution in the open-source robotics toolkit, Drake. Our novel hybrid approach enables computation of gradients for complex geometric models while reusing factorizations from contact resolution. We demonstrate robust simulation of robotic tasks at interactive rates, with accurately resolved stiction and contact transitions, supporting effective sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Parameter Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for a Computational Pulmonary Hemodynamics Model Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subject-specific modeling is a powerful tool in cardiovascular research, providing insights beyond the reach of current clinical diagnostics. Limitations in available clinical data require the incorporation of uncertainty into models to improve guidance for personalized treatments. However, for clinical relevance, such modeling must be computationally efficient. In this study, we used a one-dimensional (1D) fluid dynamics model informed by experimental data from a dog model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), incorporating measurements from multiple subjects under both baseline and CTEPH conditions. Surgical intervention can alleviate CTEPH, yet patients with microvascular disease (e.g., remodeling and narrowing of small vessels) often exhibit persistent pulmonary hypertension, highlighting the importance of assessing microvascular disease severity. Thus, each lung was modeled separately to account for the heterogeneous nature of CTEPH, allowing us to explore lung-specific microvascular narrowing and resistance. We compared inferred parameters between baseline and CTEPH and examined their correlation with clinical markers of disease severity. To accelerate model calibration, we employed Gaussian process (GP) emulators, enabling the estimation of microvascular parameters and their uncertainties within a clinically feasible timeframe. Our results demonstrated that CTEPH leads to heterogeneous microvascular adaptation, reflected in distinct parameter shifts. Notably, the changes in model parameters strongly correlated with disease severity, especially in the lung previously reported to have more advanced disease. This framework provides a rapid, uncertainty-aware method for evaluating microvascular dysfunction in CTEPH and may support more targeted treatment strategies within a timeframe suitable for clinical application.</description>

      <title>Text to model via SysML: Automated generation of dynamical system computational models from unstructured natural language text via enhanced System Modeling Language diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.</description>
