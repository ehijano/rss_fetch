      <title>Integrated Modeling of SPARC H-mode Scenarios: Exploration of the Impact of Modeling Assumptions on Predicted Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper an extensive database of SPARC H-modes confinement predictions has been provided, to assess its variability with respect to few input assumptions. The simulations have been performed within the ASTRA framework, using the quasi-linear model TGLF SAT2, including electromagnetic effects, for the core transport, and a neural network trained on EPED simulations to predict the pedestal height and width self-consistently. The database has been developed starting from two SPARC H-mode discharges (12.2 T, i.e. Primary Reference Discharge or PRD, and 8 T, i.e. reduced field) and permuting 4 input parameters (W concentration, DT mixture concentration, temperature ratio at top of pedestal and deviation of pedestal pressure from the EPED prediction), to perform a sensitivity study. For the PRD a scan of auxiliary input power (ion cyclotron heating) has been performed up to 25MW, to keep highly radiative plasmas above the LH power threshold as predicted by Martin and Schmidtmayr power scalings. A scan of pedestal density has then been performed for both PRD and 8T databases. ptop/pEPED and Ti/Te at top of pedestal showed the biggest impact on the fusion gain. Significant variation is observed across the database, highlighting the importance of sensitivity studies. Below a certain W concentration, the 12T database shows that Q &gt; 5 is consistently achieved for full-field H-modes with 11 MW of auxiliary power, and values of Q &gt; 2 are assured when increasing the input power to keep the plasma in H-mode. The 8T database demonstrates that SPARC can access a Q &gt; 1 operational window with low W concentration, making it a potentially interesting scenario for obtaining breakeven conditions.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Femtosecond Laser Induced Filament and Energy Coupling by Nanosecond Laser Pulse in Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed plasma kinetics model for laser-induced non-equilibrium plasmas in atmospheric pressure air, incorporating a self-consistent energy balance and refined rate expressions within a three-temperature framework. The model is validated against experimental data of femtosecond-laser-induced filaments, showing good agreement in electron dynamics and gas temperature. The analysis focuses on femtosecond filament decay kinetics and characteristic properties across varying initial electron densities and electron temperatures, including cases with oxygen addition and its influence on decay behavior. The study further examines energy coupling between the femtosecond filament and nanosecond laser pulse, identifying dominant kinetic pathways and optimal time delays through a comparative analysis of single-pulse and dual-pulse plasmas. Additionally, results indicate that temporal shaping of the nanosecond laser pulse intensity enhances dual-pulse performance relative to Gaussian pulses.</description>

      <title>Efficient analysis of magnetic field line behavior in toroidal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confinement of plasmas in tokamaks and stellarators depends on magnetic field lines lying in nested toroidal surfaces. The transition near the plasma edge away from the lines lying in magnetic surfaces defines properties of divertors. The transition in time defines properties of disruptions. Divertor design and disruption analysis require a detailed understanding of these transitions. The use of a Gaussian window function allows far more information to be extracted about these transitions using far shorter field line integrations than can be obtained using traditional methods based on Poincar\'e plots. The physics of divertors and disruptions is reviewed to clarify why the type of information that can be gained from more efficient methods of analysis is of central importance to the fusion program based on magnetic confinement.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field Amplification in a Rotating Astrophysical Plasma Sphere: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the generation of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity in the northern and southern hemispheres and examined their contributions to the induction of magnetic fields. We found that the $\alpha$ effect is relatively small, and its sign depends on the polarization of kinetic helicity. In contrast, the $\beta$ effect remains negative regardless of the sign of kinetic helicity. Despite its small magnitude, the $\alpha$ effect plays a crucial role in determining the polarity of helical magnetic structures, while a negative $\beta$ indicates energy diffusion from turbulent regions into the large-scale magnetic field. We derived the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity using different approaches, incorporating large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data. These were used to reproduce the large-scale magnetic field and compare it with DNS results. In the kinematic regime, where the magnetic field strength is weak, our results align well; however, in regions with strong nonlinear magnetic effects, the magnetic field reproduced using turbulent kinetic data diverges. This divergence is attributed to insufficient quenching of the $\beta$ effect, suggesting that including the second-moment terms of velocity in the magnetic field effect would improve the accuracy of the $\beta$ coefficient. In this study, we considered the case of a rotating plasma sphere with $Pr_M = 1$ and low Reynolds numbers. However, in reality, Reynolds numbers are much higher, and $Pr_M$ is much less than 1, which necessitates further studies on this topic. We plan to address this in future research.</description>

      <title>A Ritz variational principle for local collisionless gyrokinetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence driven by gyrokinetic instabilities is largely responsible for transport in magnetic fusion devices. To estimate this turbulent transport, integrated modeling codes often use mixing length estimates in conjunction with reduced models of the linearized gyrokinetic equation. One common method of formulating and solving the linearized gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem equation uses a Ritz variational principle, particularly in the local collisionless limit. However, the variational principle as typically stated in the literature is mathematically incorrect. In this work, we derive a mathematically correct form of the variational principle that applies to local linear collisionless gyrokinetics in general geometry with electromagnetic effects. We also explicitly derive a weak form of the gyrokinetic field equations suitable for numerical applications.</description>

      <title>Local Reduced-Order Modeling for Electrostatic Plasmas by Physics-Informed Solution Manifold Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in high-performance computing and modern numerical algorithms, computational cost remains prohibitive for multi-query kinetic plasma simulations. In this work, we develop data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) for collisionless electrostatic plasma dynamics, based on the kinetic Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our ROM approach projects the equation onto a linear subspace defined by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes. We introduce an efficient tensorial method to update the nonlinear term using a precomputed third-order tensor. We capture multiscale behavior with a minimal number of POD modes by decomposing the solution manifold into multiple time windows and creating temporally local ROMs. We consider two strategies for decomposition: one based on the physical time and the other based on the electric field energy. Applied to the 1D1V Vlasov-Poisson simulations, that is, prescribed E-field, Landau damping, and two-stream instability, we demonstrate that our ROMs accurately capture the total energy of the system both for parametric and time extrapolation cases. The temporally local ROMs are more efficient and accurate than the single ROM. In addition, in the two-stream instability case, we show that the energy-windowing reduced-order model (EW-ROM) is more efficient and accurate than the time-windowing reduced-order model (TW-ROM). With the tensorial approach, EW-ROM solves the equation approximately 90 times faster than Eulerian simulations while maintaining a maximum relative error of 7.5% for the training data and 11% for the testing data.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity with bells and whistlers: suppression of the magnetothermal instability in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the hot intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters, plasma microinstabilities may play an important role in the transport of heat and momentum on the large scales. In this paper, we continue our investigation of the effect of whistler suppression of thermal conductivity on the magneto-thermal instability (MTI), which may be active in the periphery of galaxy clusters and contribute to the observed turbulence. We use a closure for the heat flux inspired by kinetic simulations and show that MTI turbulence with whistler suppression exhibits a critical transition: for modest suppression of the conductivity, the MTI turbulent velocities decrease in agreement with previous MTI scaling laws. However, for suppression above a critical threshold, the MTI loses its ability to maintain equipartition-level magnetic fields through a small-scale dynamo, and the system enters a ``death-spiral''. We propose a model to explain this critical transition, and speculate that conditions in the hot ICM are favourable to the upkeep of the dynamo. Additionaly, with whistler suppression high-$\beta$ regions are brought out of thermal equilibrium while the efficiency of MTI turbulent driving is reduced. Finally, we show that external turbulence interferes with the MTI and leads to lower levels of turbulence. While individually both external turbulence and whistler suppression weaken the MTI, we find that they can exhibit a complex interplay when acting in conjunction, with external turbulence boosting the whistler-suppressed thermal conductivity and even reviving a ``dead'' MTI. Our study illustrates how extending magnetohydrodynamics with a simple prescription for microscale plasma physics can lead to the formation of a complicated dynamical system and demonstrates that further work is needed in order to bridge the gap between micro- and macro scales in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Bounding elastic photon-photon scattering at $\sqrt s \approx 1\,$MeV using a laser-plasma platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a direct search for elastic photon-photon scattering using x-ray and $\gamma$ photons from a laser-plasma based experiment. A gamma photon beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator provided a broadband gamma spectrum extending to above $E_\gamma = 200$ MeV. These were collided with a dense x-ray field produced by the emission from a laser heated germanium foil at $E_x \approx 1.4$ keV, corresponding to an invariant mass of $\sqrt{s} = 1.22 \pm 0.22$ MeV. In these asymmetric collisions elastic scattering removes one x-ray and one high-energy $\gamma$ photon and outputs two lower energy $\gamma$ photons. No changes in the $\gamma$ photon spectrum were observed as a result of the collisions allowing us to place a 95% upper bound on the cross section of $1.5 \times 10^{15}\,\mu$b. Although far from the QED prediction, this represents the lowest upper limit obtained so far for $\sqrt{s} \lesssim 1$ MeV.</description>
