      <title>Reinforced Linear Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) is a powerful technique that allows for a variety of problems to be solved using a linear representation of programs. However, there still exists some limitations to the technique, such as the need for humans to explicitly map registers to actions. This thesis proposes a novel approach that uses Q-Learning on top of LGP, Reinforced Linear Genetic Programming (RLGP) to learn the optimal register-action assignments. In doing so, we introduce a new framework "linear-gp" written in memory-safe Rust that allows for extensive experimentation for future works.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous computing platform for real-time robotics</title>

Abstract: After Industry 4.0 has embraced tight integration between machinery (OT), software (IT), and the Internet, creating a web of sensors, data, and algorithms in service of efficient and reliable production, a new concept of Society 5.0 is emerging, in which infrastructure of a city will be instrumented to increase reliability, efficiency, and safety. Robotics will play a pivotal role in enabling this vision that is pioneered by the NEOM initiative - a smart city, co-inhabited by humans and robots. In this paper we explore the computing platform that will be required to enable this vision. We show how we can combine neuromorphic computing hardware, exemplified by the Loihi2 processor used in conjunction with event-based cameras, for sensing and real-time perception and interaction with a local AI compute cluster (GPUs) for high-level language processing, cognition, and task planning. We demonstrate the use of this hybrid computing architecture in an interactive task, in which a humanoid robot plays a musical instrument with a human. Central to our design is the efficient and seamless integration of disparate components, ensuring that the synergy between software and hardware maximizes overall performance and responsiveness. Our proposed system architecture underscores the potential of heterogeneous computing architectures in advancing robotic autonomy and interactive intelligence, pointing toward a future where such integrated systems become the norm in complex, real-time applications.</description>

      <title>A Compute and Communication Runtime Model for Loihi 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computers hold the potential to vastly improve the speed and efficiency of a wide range of computational kernels with their asynchronous, compute-memory co-located, spatially distributed, and scalable nature. However, performance models that are simple yet sufficiently expressive to predict runtime on actual neuromorphic hardware are lacking, posing a challenge for researchers and developers who strive to design fast algorithms and kernels. As breaking the memory bandwidth wall of conventional von-Neumann architectures is a primary neuromorphic advantage, modeling communication time is especially important. At the same time, modeling communication time is difficult, as complex congestion patterns arise in a heavily-loaded Network-on-Chip. In this work, we introduce the first max-affine lower-bound runtime model -- a multi-dimensional roofline model -- for Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip that quantitatively accounts for both compute and communication based on a suite of microbenchmarks. Despite being a lower-bound model, we observe a tight correspondence (Pearson correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.97) between our model's estimated runtime and the measured runtime on Loihi 2 for a neural network linear layer, i.e., matrix-vector multiplication, and for an example application, a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization solver. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for communication-bottlenecked runtime to study scalability of the linear layer, revealing an area-runtime tradeoff for different spatial workload configurations with linear to superliner runtime scaling in layer size with a variety of constant factors. Our max-affine runtime model helps empower the design of high-speed algorithms and kernels for Loihi 2.</description>

      <title>Multi-Constrained Evolutionary Molecular Design Framework: An Interpretable Drug Design Method Combining Rule-Based Evolution and Molecular Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes MCEMOL (Multi-Constrained Evolutionary Molecular Design Framework), a molecular optimization approach integrating rule-based evolution with molecular crossover. MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution: optimizing transformation rules at rule level while applying crossover and mutation to molecular structures. Unlike deep learning methods requiring large datasets and extensive training, our algorithm evolves efficiently from minimal starting molecules with low computational overhead. The framework incorporates message-passing neural networks and comprehensive chemical constraints, ensuring efficient and interpretable molecular design. Experimental results demonstrate that MCEMOL provides transparent design pathways through its evolutionary mechanism while generating valid, diverse, target-compliant molecules. The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with high structural diversity and excellent drug-likeness compliance, showing strong performance in symmetry constraints, pharmacophore optimization, and stereochemical integrity. Unlike black-box methods, MCEMOL delivers dual value: interpretable transformation rules researchers can understand and trust, alongside high-quality molecular libraries for practical applications. This establishes a paradigm where interpretable AI-driven drug design and effective molecular generation are achieved simultaneously, bridging the gap between computational innovation and practical drug discovery needs.</description>

      <title>An Ensemble of Evolutionary Algorithms With Both Crisscross Search and Sparrow Search for Processing Inferior Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, real parameter single objective optimization is an important direction. Both the Differential Evolution (DE) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) demonstrate good performance for real parameter single objective optimization. Nevertheless, there exist other types of evolutionary algorithm for the purpose. In recent years, researchers begin to study long-term search. EA4eig - an ensemble of three DE variants and CMA-ES - performs well for long-term search. In this paper, we introduce two types of evolutionary algorithm proposed recently - crisscross search and sparrow search - into EA4eig as secondary evolutionary algorithms to process inferior individuals. Thus, EA4eigCS is obtained. In our ensemble, the secondary evolutionary algorithms are expected to vary distribution of the population for breaking stagnation. Experimental results show that our EA4eigCS outperforms EA4eig and is competitive when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

      <title>PACEvolve: Enabling Long-Horizon Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm Based Combinatorial Optimization for the Optimal Design of Water Distribution Network of Gurudeniya Service Zone, Sri Lanka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper brings an in detail Genetic Algorithm (GA) based combinatorial optimization method used for the optimal design of the water distribution network (WDN) of Gurudeniya Service Zone, Sri Lanka. Genetic Algorithm (GA) mimics the survival of the fittest principle of nature to develop a search process. Methodology employs fuzzy combinations of pipe diameters to check their suitability to be considered as the cost effective optimal design solutions. Furthermore, the hydraulic constraints were implicitly evaluated within the GA itself in its aim to reaching the global optimum solution. Upon analysis, the results of this approach delivered agreeable design outputs. In addition, the comparison made between the results obtained by a previous study inspired by the Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) Algorithm and results obtained by the GA based approach, proves competency of GA for the optimal design of water distribution network in Gurudeniya Service Zone, Sri Lanka.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

      <title>SiliconHealth: A Complete Low-Cost Blockchain Healthcare Infrastructure for Resource-Constrained Regions Using Repurposed Bitcoin Mining ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SiliconHealth, a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare infrastructure designed for resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems.</description>

      <title>Controlled Self-Evolution for Algorithmic Code Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.
