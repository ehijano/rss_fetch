      <title>The LED calibration systems for the mDOM and D-Egg sensor modules of the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, instrumenting about 1 km$^3$ of deep, glacial ice at the geographic South Pole, is due to be enhanced with the IceCube Upgrade. The IceCube Upgrade, to be deployed during the 2025/26 Antarctic summer season, will consist of seven new strings of photosensors, densely embedded near the bottom center of the existing array. Aside from a world-leading sensitivity to neutrino oscillations, a primary goal is the improvement of the calibration of the optical properties of the instrumented ice. These will be applied to the entire archive of IceCube data, improving the angular and energy resolution of the detected neutrino events. For this purpose, the Upgrade strings include a host of new calibration devices. Aside from dedicated calibration modules, several thousand LED flashers have been incorporated into the photosensor modules. We describe the design, production, and testing of these LED flashers before their integration into the sensor modules as well as the use of the LED flashers during lab testing of assembled sensor modules.</description>

      <title>Synthesizer: a Software Package for Synthetic Astronomical Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03888v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables. The code is publicly available at https://synthesizer-project.github.io/</description>

      <title>MIRAC-5 on the MMT with MAPS: annular groove phase mask N-band coronagraphic upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the coronagraphic upgrade underway for the Mid-Infrared Array Camera-5 (MIRAC-5) to be used with the 6.5-m MMT telescope utilizing the new MMT Adaptive optics exoPlanet characterization System (MAPS). Mid-IR ground-based coronagraphic adaptive-optics-assisted imaging can be a powerful tool for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres and studying protoplanets in formation within circumstellar disks around young stars. In addition to enabling ground-based observations of bright targets in the background limit, high actuator density 1-2 kHz adaptive optics systems can be competitive with JWST in the contrast limit. We have procured an annular groove phase mask (AGPM) and performed preliminary characterization of its on-axis source rejection as a function of wavelength. We present an optimized Lyot Stop design for use with the AGPM using the High-contrast End-to-End Performance Simulator (HEEPS). Future work includes implementing the Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing (QACITS) control loop algorithm with MAPS. We present the system overview, pupil mask design, and expected performance metrics aligned with our scientific goals, building upon recent advances with MIRAC-5 (Bowens et al. 2025) and MAPS.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for air shower profile reconstruction with dense radio antenna arrays using Information Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the longitudinal profile of extensive air showers, generated from the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere, is crucial to understanding their mass composition, which in turn provides valuable insight on their possible sources of origin. Dense radio antenna arrays such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) telescope as well as the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) are ideal instruments to explore the potential of air shower profile reconstruction, as their high antenna density allows cosmic ray observations with unprecedented accuracy. However, current analysis approaches can only recover $X_\mathrm{max}$, the atmospheric depth at shower maximum, and heavily rely on computationally expensive simulations. As such, it is ever more crucial to develop new analysis approaches that can perform a full air shower profile reconstruction efficiently.
  In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct the longitudinal profile of air showers using measurements from radio detectors with Information Field Theory (IFT), a state-of-the-art reconstruction framework based on Bayesian inference. Through IFT, we are able to exploit all available information in the signal (amplitude, phase, and pulse shape) at each antenna position simultaneously and explicitly utilise models that are motivated through our current understanding of air shower physics. We verify our framework on simulated datasets prepared for LOFAR, showcasing that we can not only reconstruct the air shower profile with uncertainties in each atmospheric depth bin but also recover the reconstructed trace at each antenna position. Our framework demonstrates that radio measurements with dense antenna layouts such as LOFAR and SKAO have the capability to go beyond reconstruction of $X_\mathrm{max}$ and will thus aid in our understanding of the mass composition of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Detection of Spaceborne Lasers with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of side-scattered ultraviolet light from spaceborne lasers with fluorescence telescopes of cosmic ray observatories offers unique opportunities for systematic studies of the aerosol content of the local atmosphere. It also enables the validation of the optical calibration of the telescopes. Additionally, these observations provide valuable ground-based monitoring of the performance of the scientific instruments aboard satellites used for Earth climate observation. Here, we report on results from the reconstruction of laser shots from the spaceborne lidar instrument ALADIN aboard the Aeolus satellite in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Furthermore, we present initial observations of laser shots from ATLID, the atmospheric lidar of the EarthCARE satellite, launched in 2024. EarthCARE's orbit is particularly well-suited for enabling laser detection within a few days at both the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array Experiment, facilitating a relative calibration of the energy scales of these observatories.</description>

      <title>Super Resolved Imaging with Adaptive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV) and image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is under-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational imaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive optics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use the AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely controlled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images that exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then be jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we show this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO operation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate end-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the upsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal statistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our experimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations, demonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO super-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no hardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a complete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily transferred to an operational telescope.

      <title>A New Approach to Compiling Exoatmospheric Target Lists And Quantifying the Ground-Based Resources Needed to Vet Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transiting exoplanet atmospheric characterization is currently in a golden age as dozens of exoplanet atmospheres are being studied by NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. This trend is expected to continue with NASA's Pandora Smallsat and Roman Space Telescope and ESA's Ariel mission (all expected to launch within this decade) and NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (expected to launch in the early 2040s) all of which are centered around studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. Here we explore a new approach to constructing large scale exoatmospheric survey lists, which combines the use of traditional transmission/emission spectroscopy figures of merit with a focus on more-evenly sampling planets across a range of radii and equilibrium temperatures. After assembling a sample target list comprised of 750 transmission spectroscopy targets and 150 emission spectroscopy targets, we quantify the potential time lost to stale transit and eclipse ephemerides and find that hundreds of hours of space-based observing could be wasted given current uncertainties in orbital periods, transit epochs, and orbital eccentricities. We further estimate the amount of ground-based telescope time necessary to obtain sufficiently precise exoplanet masses and find that it exceeds 100 nights of 10m telescope time. Based upon these findings, we provide a list of recommendations that would make community efforts for preparation and interpretation of atmospheric characterization endeavors more effective and efficient. The strategies we recommend here can be used to support both current (e.g., HST and JWST) and future exoplanet atmosphere characterization missions (e.g., Pandora, Ariel, Roman, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory).</description>

      <title>Worlds Next Door: A Candidate Giant Planet Imaged in the Habitable Zone of $\alpha$ Cen A. II. Binary Star Modeling, Planet and Exozodi Search, and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observed our closest solar twin, $\alpha$ Cen A, with the MIRI coronagraph in F1550C (15.5 $\mu$m) at three distinct epochs between August 2024 and April 2025. For the first time with JWST, we demonstrate the application of reference star differential imaging to simultaneously subtract the coronagraphic image of a primary star and the point spread function (PSF) of its binary companion to conduct a deep search for exoplanets and dust emission. We achieve a typical 5$\sigma$ point source contrast sensitivity between $\sim$$10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ at separations $\gtrsim$ 1" and an exozodiacal disk (coplanar with $\alpha$ Cen AB) sensitivity of $\sim$5-8$\times$ the Solar System's zodiacal cloud around $\alpha$ Cen A. The latter is an extraordinary limit, representing the deepest sensitivity to exozodiacal disks achieved for any stellar system to date. Post-processing with the PCA-KLIP algorithm reveals a point source, called $S1$, in August 2024, detected at S/N $=$ 4-6 (3.3-4.3$\sigma$), a separation of $\approx$1.5" (2 au), and with a F1550C flux (contrast) of $\approx$3.5 mJy ($\approx 5.5 \times 10^{-5}$). Various tests conducted with the data show that $S1$ is unlikely to be a detector or PSF subtraction artifact and confirm that it is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not re-detected in the two follow-up observations (February and April 2025). If $S1$ is astrophysical in nature, the only explanation is that it has moved to a region of poor sensitivity due to orbital motion. We perform PSF injection-recovery tests and provide 2D sensitivity maps for each epoch to enable orbital completeness calculations. Additional observations are necessary to re-detect candidate $S1$ and confirm its nature as a planet orbiting our nearest solar-type neighbor.</description>

Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are crucial for studying stellar dynamics and galactic structure, yet precise measurements of their distances and masses are often limited by uncertainties in electromagnetic (EM) observations. We present a novel method that leverages gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) orbiting within GCs to enhance the precision of GC parameter measurements. The BBH's orbital motion imprints characteristic modulations on the GW waveform, encoding information about the host GC. Using post-Newtonian waveforms and Lorentz transformations, we simulate modulated GW signals and evaluate the resulting parameter constraints via a Fisher information matrix analysis. Our results show that incorporating GW observations can significantly reduce the uncertainties in GC distance and mass measurements, in many cases achieving improvements by an order of magnitude. These findings demonstrate the value of BBHs as dynamical probes and highlight the power of GWs to advance GC studies beyond the limits of traditional EM methods.</description>

      <title>Improved limits on the 21cm signal at z=6.5-7.0 with the MWA using Gaussian information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the properties of interferometric data from high-redshift 21~cm measurements using the Murchison Widefield Array. These data contain redshifted 21~cm signal, contamination from continuum foreground sources, and radiometric noise. The 21~cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization is expected to be highly-Gaussian, which motivates the use of the power spectrum as an effective statistical tool for extracting astrophysical information. We find that foreground contamination introduces non-Gaussianity into the distribution of measurements, and then use this information to separate Gaussian from non-Gaussian signal. We present improved upper limits on the 21cm EoR power spectrum from the MWA using a Gaussian component of the data, based on the existing analysis from Nunhokee et al (2025). This is extracted as the best-fitting Gaussian to the measured data. Our best 2 sigma (thermal+sample variance) limit for 268 hours of data improves from (30.2~mK)^2 to (23.0~mK)^2 at z=6.5 for the EW polarisation, and from (39.2~mK)^2 to (21.7~mK)^2 = 470~mK^2 in NS. The best limits at z=6.8 (z=7.0) improve to P &lt; (25.9~mK)^2 (P &lt; (32.0~mK)^2), and k = 0.18h/Mpc (k = 0.21h/Mpc). Results are compared with realistic simulations, which indicate that leakage from foreground contamination is a source of the non-Gaussian behaviour.</description>

      <title>Rapid parameter estimation with the full symphony of compact binary mergers using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast Bayesian inference framework to address the growing computational cost of gravitational-wave parameter estimation. The increased cost is driven by improved broadband detector sensitivity, particularly at low frequencies due to advances in detector commissioning, resulting in longer in-band signals and a higher detection rate. Waveform models now incorporate features like higher-order modes, further increasing the complexity of standard inference methods. Our framework employs meshfree likelihood interpolation with radial basis functions to accelerate Bayesian inference using the IMRPhenomXHM waveform model that incorporates higher modes of the gravitational-wave signal. In the initial start-up stage, interpolation nodes are placed within a constant-match metric ellipsoid in the intrinsic parameter space. During sampling, likelihood is evaluated directly using the precomputed interpolants, bypassing the costly steps of on-the-fly waveform generation and overlap-integral computation. We improve efficiency by sampling in a rotated parameter space aligned with the eigenbasis of the metric ellipsoid, where parameters are uncorrelated by construction. This speeds up sampler convergence. This method yields unbiased parameter recovery when applied to 100 simulated neutron-star-black-hole signals (NSBH) in LIGO-Virgo data, while reducing computational cost by up to an order of magnitude for the longest-duration signal. The meshfree framework equally applies to symmetric compact binary systems dominated by the quadrupole mode, supporting parameter estimation across a broad range of sources. Applied to a simulated NSBH signal in Einstein Telescope data, where the effects of Earth's rotation are neglected for simplicity, our method achieves an O(10^4) speed-up, demonstrating its potential use in the third-generation (3G) era.</description>

      <title>A Novel Technosignature Search in the Breakthrough Listen Green Bank Telescope Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Breakthrough Listen program is, to date, the most extensive search for technological life beyond Earth. As part of this goal, over the past nine years it has surveyed thousands of nearby stars, close to 100 nearby galaxies, and a variety of exotic and solar system objects with telescopes around the world, including the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia. The goal is to find evidence of technosignatures of other civilizations, such as narrowband Doppler drifting radio signals. Despite the GBT's location in a radio-quiet zone, the primary challenge of this search continues to be the high quantities of human-generated radio-frequency interference (RFI), and the ability to pick out genuinely promising candidates from it. Here we present a novel search method aimed at finding these `needle-in-a-haystack' type signals, applied to 6,630 observation cadences of 2,623 stars (each observed with one or more of the L, S, C, and X band receivers) from the GBT archive. We implement a low-complexity statistical process to vet out RFI and highlight signals that, upon visual inspection, appear more promising than those from previous analyses. Our work returns candidate signals found previously using both traditional and machine learning algorithms, as well as many promising ones not previously identified. This analysis represents the largest dataset searched for technosignatures to date, and highlights the efficacy that traditional (non-machine-learning) algorithms continue to have in these types of technosignature searches. We find that less than 1% of stars host transmitters brighter than 0.3 Arecibo radar equivalents broadcasting in our direction over the frequency band covered.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Fast Modeling of Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lenses in the Big Data Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy strong lensing provides a powerful probe of galaxy formation, evolution, and the properties of dark matter and dark energy. However, conventional lens-modeling approaches are computationally expensive and require fine-tuning to avoid local optima, rendering them impractical for the hundreds of thousands of lenses expected from surveys such as Euclid, CSST, and Roman Space Telescopes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TinyLensGPU, a GPU-accelerated lens-modeling tool that employs XLA-based acceleration with JAX and a neural-network-enhanced nested sampling algorithm, nautilus-sampler. Tests on 1,000 simulated galaxy-galaxy lenses demonstrate that on an RTX 4060 Ti GPU, TinyLensGPU achieves likelihood evaluations approximately 2,000 times faster than traditional methods. Moreover, the nautilus-sampler reduces the number of likelihood evaluations by a factor of 3, decreasing the overall modeling time per lens from several days to roughly 3 minutes. Application to 63 SLACS lenses observed by the Hubble Space Telescope recovers Einstein radii consistent with the literature values (within $\lesssim 5\%$ deviation), which is within known systematic uncertainties. Catastrophic failures, where the sampler becomes trapped in local optima, occur in approximately 5\% of the simulated cases and 10\% of the SLACS sample. We argue that such issues are inherent to automated lens modeling but can be mitigated by incorporating prior knowledge from machine learning techniques. This work thus marks a promising step toward the efficient analysis of strong lenses in the era of big data. The code and data are available online: https://github.com/caoxiaoyue/TinyLensGpu.</description>

      <title>Environmental impacts of astronomical research infrastructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human activities degrade the Earth environment at an unprecedented scale and pace, threatening Earth-system stability, resilience and life-support functions. We can of course deny the facts, get angry about them, or try to bargain. Or we may overcome these stages of grief and move towards accepting that human activities need to change, including our own ones. The purpose of this paper is to support astronomers in this transition, by providing insights into the origins of environmental impacts in astronomical research and proposing changes that would make the field sustainable. The paper focuses on the environmental impacts of research infrastructures, since these are the dominant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in astronomy, acknowledging that impact reductions in other areas, for example professional air travelling, need also to be achieved.</description>

      <title>Development of Space Qualified Signal Processing Readout Electronics for HabWorlds and Origins Space Telescope Detector and Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics -- will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, a significant number of observatories and universities have been planning to construct optical and infrared telescopes at the Lenghu site in Qinghai Province due to the site's excellent seeing and clear night sky fraction. Although astronomical performances of the Lenghu site have been reported in detail by numerous papers, there were few reports showing statistics of temperature and wind characteristics in the traditional way required for the design of steel structures of large astronomical telescopes and enclosures, as well as the ventilation and air conditioning systems of these enclosures. This paper aims to present such new statistical data on temperature and wind conditions at the site, which could be helpful to inform and aid in such design decisions at the Lenghu site</description>

      <title>Incorporation of model accuracy in gravitational wave Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of colliding black holes from gravitational-wave observations is subject to systematic errors arising from modelling uncertainties. Although the accuracy of each model can be calculated through comparison to theoretical expectations from general relativity, Bayesian analyses are yet to incorporate this information. As such, a mixture model is typically used where results obtained with different gravitational-wave models are combined with either equal weight, or based on their relative Bayesian evidence. In this work we present a novel method to incorporate the accuracy of multiple models in gravitational-wave Bayesian analyses. By analysing simulated gravitational-wave signals in zero-noise, we show that our technique uses $30\%$ less computational resources, and more faithfully recovers the true parameters than existing techniques. We further apply our method to a real gravitational-wave signal and, when assuming the binary black hole hypothesis, demonstrate that the source of GW191109_010717 has unequal component masses, with the primary having a $69\%$ probability that it lies above the maximum black hole mass from stellar collapse. We envisage that this method will become an essential tool within ground-based gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The CatSouth Quasar Candidate Catalog for the Southern Sky and a Unified All-Sky Catalog Based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 has provided a large sample of more than 6.6 million quasar candidates with high completeness but low purity. Previous work on the CatNorth quasar candidate catalog has shown that including external multiband data and applying machine-learning methods can efficiently purify the original Gaia DR3 quasar candidate catalog and improve the redshift estimates. In this paper, we extend the Gaia DR3 quasar candidate selection to the southern hemisphere using data from SkyMappper, CatWISE, and VISTA surveys. We train an XGBoost classifier on a unified set of high-confidence stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars and galaxies. For sources with available Gaia BP/RP spectra, spectroscopic redshifts are derived using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (RegNet). We also train an ensemble photometric redshift estimation model based on XGBoost, TabNet, and FT-Transformer, achieving an RMSE of 0.2256 and a normalized median absolute deviation of 0.0187 on the validation set. By merging CatSouth with the previously published CatNorth catalog, we construct the unified all-sky CatGlobe catalog with nearly 1.9 million sources at $G&lt;21$, providing a comprehensive and high-purity quasar candidate sample for future spectroscopic and cosmological investigations.</description>

      <title>From Queries to Criteria: Understanding How Astronomers Evaluate LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability, particularly for use in scientific research.</description>
