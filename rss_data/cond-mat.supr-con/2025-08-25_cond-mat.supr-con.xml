      <title>Unconventional superconductivity induced by rare-earth substitution in Nd1-xEuxNiO2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temperature superconductivity is typically associated with strong coupling and a large superconducting gap, yet these characteristics have not been demonstrated in the nickelates. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Eu substitution in the spacer layer of Nd1-xEuxNiO2 (NENO) thin films enhances the superconducting gap, driving the system toward a strong-coupling regime. This is accompanied by a magnetic-exchange-driven magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. We investigate the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2, and superconducting gap of superconducting NENO thin films with x=0.2 to 0.35. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity in NENO films. We interpret this phenomenon as a result of interaction between magnetic Eu ions and superconducting states in the Ni dx2-y2 orbital. The upper critical magnetic field strongly violates the weak-coupling Pauli limit. Infrared spectroscopy confirms a large gap-to-Tc ratio $2 \Delta k_B T_c \approx 5 - 6$, indicating a stronger coupling pairing mechanism in NENO relative to the Sr-doped NdNiO2. The substitution of Eu in the rare-earth layer provides a method to modify the superconducting gap in Nd-based nickelates, an essential factor in engineering high-Tc superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Thermomodulated intrinsic Josephson effect in Kagome CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting chiral domains associated with a time-reversal symmetry-breaking order parameter have garnered significant attention in Kagome systems. In this work, we demonstrate both the intrinsic direct-current and alternating-current Josephson effects in the nanoplates of the vanadium-based Kagome material CsV3Sb5, as evidenced by Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps. Moreover, both the Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps are modulated by thermal cycling, suggesting that the Josephson effects arise from dynamic superconducting domains. These findings may provide new insights into chiral superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 and highlight the potential of these intrinsic Josephson junctions for applications in chiral superconductor based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Extreme magnetic field-boosted superconductivity in a high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity through Pauli and orbital limiting effects. However, there are rare instances of magnetic-field-induced superconductivity, as seen in Chevrel phase compounds [1], organic conductors [2], uranium-based heavy-fermion systems [3, 4], and moire graphene [5], though these materials possess inherently low superconducting transition temperatures (Tc). Here, we demonstrate high field-stabilized superconductivity in a class of materials with a significantly higher Tc (up to 40 K): the infinite-layer nickelates [6]. Both low-field and high-field superconducting states can be plausibly explained by a compensation mechanism akin to the Jaccarino-Peter effect. These findings demonstrate the possibility of achieving substantially enhanced upper critical fields in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer empties the flat band in 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ -- except at the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4H\textsubscript{b} polytype of TaS$_2$ is a natural heterostructure of H and T-type layers. Intriguing recent evidence points towards a possibly chiral superconducting ground state, unlike the superconductivity found in other polytypes where the T layers are absent, requiring understanding of the possible contributions of electrons from the T layers. Here we use micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal that the T termination of the 4H\textsubscript{b} structure is metallic, but a subsurface T layer -- seen below an H termination and thus more representative of the bulk case -- is gapped. The results imply a complete charge transfer of 1 electron per 13 Ta from the T to adjacent H layers in the bulk, but an incomplete charge transfer at the T termination, yielding a metallic Fermi surface with a planar-chiral character. A similar metallic state is found in an anomalous region with likely T-H-H' stacking at the surface. Our results exclude cluster Mott localisation in either the bulk or surface of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and point to a scenario of superconductivity arising from Josephson-like tunneling between the H layers.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spin-glass superconductivity in nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) nickelate superconductors under high pressure heralds a new chapter of high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity. Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain, unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics. Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50 K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis, indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis, revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Chiral charge density wave in 4Hb- and 1T-TaS$_2$: The Role of interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (micro-ARPES) to investigate chiral charge density waves (CDWs) in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the 1T layers of 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we uncover coexisting left- and right-handed CDW domains and resolve four distinct spectral patterns arising from the interplay of chirality and rotational stacking. In contrast, bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits a uniform chirality. In addition, 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shows negligible out-of-plane dispersion of the 1T-derived bands, in contrast to the pronounced interlayer coupling observed in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this picture, revealing that the interlayer interaction of the chiral order in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is nearly two orders of magnitude weaker than in the 1T polytype. Our findings establish 4Hb-TaS$_2$ as a quasi-two-dimensional platform for exploring tunable chiral CDW phenomena.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature Induced Spin Nernst and Thermal Edelstein Effects in Proximity Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two thermo-spintronic responses in proximity induced superconductors with spin-orbit coupled band - spin Nernst effect and thermal Edelstein effect stemming respectively from momentum-space and mixed superconducting Berry curvatures. We unveil that the Bloch band spin-orbit coupling and pairing are entangled in shaping the superconducting Berry curvatures rather than in an additive manner. The resulting thermo-spintronic responses are significantly enhanced at low temperatures by the emergence of Bogoliubov Fermi surface, and can be effectively controlled by tuning the latter. The effects render a probe of Bogoliubov Fermi surface and superconducting Berry curvatures supported by it. Our work reveals Berry curvature properties in topologically trivial proximity superconductors with spin-orbit coupling, and opens a new route to superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the crystal structure in the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ via nonlinear phononics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Robust field re-entrant superconductivity in ferromagnetic infinite-layer rare-earth nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Photon-instanton scattering in a superconducting circuit: Beyond the very high impedance regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time due to the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we alleviate these restrictions by incorporating numerical methods that eliminate some of the previously applied approximations. Our results improve the agreement with the experimental measurements, also for devices with lower impedances and thus shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Bimodal distribution of delay times and splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak in a double-barrier normal-superconductor junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a scattering theory of the proximity effect in a weakly disordered SININ junction (S = superconductor, I = insulating barrier, N = normal metal). This allows to relate the conductance and density of states of the junction to the scattering times $\tau$ (eigenvalues of the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix). The probability density $P(\tau)$ has two peaks, at a short time $\tau_{\rm min}$ and a late time $\tau_{\rm max}$. The density of states at the Fermi level is the geometric mean of the two times. The splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak is given by $\hbar/\tau_{\rm max}$.</description>
