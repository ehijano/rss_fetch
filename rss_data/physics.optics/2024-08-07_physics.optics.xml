      <title>Integrated nanophotonic polarizers in silicon waveguides and ring resonators using graphene oxide 2D films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate waveguide and microring resonator (MRR) polarizers by integrating 2D graphene oxide (GO) films onto silicon (Si) photonic devices. The 2D GO films with highly anisotropic light absorption are on-chip integrated with precise control over their thicknesses and sizes. Detailed measurements are performed for the fabricated devices with different GO film thicknesses, coating lengths, and Si waveguide widths. The results show that a maximum polarization-dependent loss (PDL) of ~17 dB is achieved for the hybrid waveguides, and the hybrid MRRs achieved a maximum polarization extinction ratio (PER) of ~10 dB. We also characterize the wavelength- and power-dependent response for these polarizers. The former demonstrates a broad operation bandwidth of over ~100 nm, and the latter verifies performance improvement enabled by photo-thermal changes in GO films. By fitting the experimental results with theoretical simulations, we find that the anisotropy in the loss of GO films dominates the polarization selectivity of these devices. These results highlight the strong potential of 2D GO films for realizing high-performance polarization selective devices in Si photonic platform.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Dispersion Equation Combining Coupled Modes, Parity-Time Symmetry, and Leaky Waves Describing Non-Decaying Leaky Surface Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized dispersion equation is derived featuring coupled mode theory, parity-time symmetry, and leaky wave antennas of arbitrary periodic modulation. It can be specialized to each of these cases individually or can describe a structure containing all three electromagnetic phenomena simultaneously in a single antenna. This very general dispersion equation is derived using both mode matching and the transverse resonance method, the latter lacking the ability to provide the field descriptions and wave impedances at the cost of computational simplicity. Using the dispersion equation, a sinusoidally modulated reactive sheet (SMRS) supported by an active impedance sheet backed dielectric spacer is designed. The active impedance sheet is designed to compensate the SMRS radiative leakage loss when coupled in close proximity. Due to the coupling, each spatial harmonic generated by the SMRS modulation is characterized by a purely real propagation constant and hence leaky wave radiation is generated from surface waves which do not decay. Due to the non-decaying nature of the surface waves, an input to output surface wave port-to-port |S21| would be unity despite an open far field channel being generated. The non-decaying leaky surface wave antenna is compared to the traditional PEC backed SMRS. The non-decaying leaky surface waves give rise to perfect aperture efficiency and the associated radiation pattern making it far superior to the traditional PEC backed SMRS case. Full-wave simulations corroborate the results. These types of antennas can make sensors probed from the far field where changes in S21 amplitude directly correlate to local changes in the waveguiding environment.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-speed thin-film lithium niobate optical coherent receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of the thin-film lithium niobate platform has established it as a premier choice for high-performance photonics integration. High-speed optical coherent receivers are essential for supporting the large communication capacities required by data center interconnects. Although high-speed photodiodes have been demonstrated on the thin-film LiNbO3 platform, the development of an ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on this platform has not yet been realized. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultra-wideband PD and ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on an InP-LiNbO3 wafer-level heterogeneous integration platform. The fabricated single PD exhibits a record-high bandwidth of 140 GHz and successfully receives a high-quality 100-Gbaud pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) signal. Furthermore, a thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver, featuring a large balanced detection bandwidth of 60 GHz, a large common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) exceeding 20 dB, and a low energy consumption of 9.6 fJ per bit, enables an ultrahigh-speed coherent reception with advanced modulation formats. The single-polarization I-Q coherent receiver, incorporating a compact 2x4 90 optical hybrid and a balanced photodetector array, achieves a receiving capacity of 600 Gbps per channel with 100-Gbaud 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal and 512 Gbps per channel with 128-Gbaud 16 QAM signal. Additionally, we demonstrate a long-distance reception of 100 Gbaud quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 16 QAM signals over transmission distances of 1040 km and 25 km. A seven-channel single-polarization I-Q coherent receiving chip achieves a total receiving capacity of 3.584 Tbps. This heterogeneous-integrated thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver shows the potential for Pbps-scale applications in future hyperscale data center interconnects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging Using Spatially Entangled Photon Pairs from a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces with subwavelength thickness were recently established as versatile platforms for the enhanced and tailorable generation of entangled photon pairs. The small dimensions and inherent stability of integrated metasurface sources are attractive for free-space applications in quantum communications, sensing, and imaging, yet this remarkable potential remained unexplored. Here, we formulate and experimentally demonstrate the unique benefits and practical potential of nonlinear metasurfaces for quantum imaging at infrared wavelengths, facilitating an efficient protocol combining ghost and all-optical scanning imaging. The metasurface incorporates a subwavelength-scale silica metagrating on a lithium niobate thin film. Its distinguishing feature is the capability to all-optically scan the photon emission angle in the direction across the grating simply by tuning the pump beam wavelength. Simultaneously, the photon emission is broad and anti-correlated along the grating direction, allowing for ghost imaging. Thereby, we reconstruct the images of 2D objects using just a 1D detector array in the idler path and a bucket detector in the signal path, by recording the dependencies of photon coincidences on the pump wavelength. Our results reveal new possibilities for quantum imaging with ultra-large field of view and improved imaging resolution as compared to photon pairs from conventional bulky crystals. The demonstrated concept can be extended to multi-wavelength operation and other applications such as quantum object tracking, paving the way for advancements in quantum technologies using ultra-compact nanostructured metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Experimental minimum of condensed-phase optical refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first demonstration of optical refrigeration in a rare-earth-doped glass nearly 30 years ago, the nascent field of laser cooling solids has progressed significantly. It is now possible to demonstrate payload cooling to ~91 K using laser-excited ytterbium-doped fluoride crystals. Realizing lower temperatures, however, requires achieving ultrahigh purities in existing rare earth-doped crystals or establishing new cooling media. For the latter, semiconductors are an obvious choice given higher cooling power densities and predicted cooling floors as low as 10 K. This has stimulated a race to demonstrate the optical refrigeration of a semiconductor. It is therefore timely to systematize the necessary and sufficient experimental minimum criteria for reporting optical refrigeration results to elevate the reliability and reproducibility of current and future optical refrigeration claims.
  We distill an optical refrigeration Experimental Minimum (EM) that we propose will standardize the reporting of new cooling results. EM tenets fall into the following categories: demonstrations of explicit heating vs cooling, optical cooling metrics, thermodynamic consistency, and reliable temperature measurements.
  All optical refrigeration claims should demonstrate the above four criteria to ensure their reliability and verifiability. We further propose that the EM serve as a guide for reviewing literature claims in the field.</description>

      <title>Long-range optomechanical interactions in SiN membrane arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that light coupling the center-of-mass mode of the membranes can cause coherent mechanical noise cancellation. Long-range interactions involving the breathing mode of the membranes have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the breathing mode of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral Floquet Engineering on Topological Fermions in Chiral Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of chiralities in light and quantum matter provides an opportunity to design and manipulate chirality-dependent properties in quantum materials. Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on topological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via circularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not compromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces the crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation. The Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the chiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which determines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts. Regarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping, momentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient anomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale, which Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe spectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into exploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree of freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Switch and Spatial Lattice Solitons of Photonic s-p Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop fs laser-fabricated asymmetric couplers and zig-zag arrays consisting of single and two-mode waveguides with bipartite nonlinearity. The fundamental mode ($s$ orbital) is near resonance with the neighboring higher-order $p$ orbital, causing efficient light transfer at low power. Due to Kerr nonlinearity, the coupler works as an all-optical switch between $s$ and $p$ orbitals. Single- and double-peak spatial solitons of $s$-$p$ orbitals form in the lattice due to the bipartite nature of the on-site nonlinearity. We probe highly localized bulk and edge solitons, peaked at the $s$ and $p$ orbitals, spectrally residing in the photonic band gap. Our work will be important for exploring inter-orbital couplings and nonlinear interactions in intricate photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Photonic Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon in statistical physics for which a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward equilibrium faster than a state closer to equilibrium. This effect has raised a great curiosity since long time and has been studied extensively in many classical and quantum systems. Here it is shown that the Mpemba effect can be observed in optics as well. Specifically, the process of light diffusion in finite-sized photonic lattices under incoherent (dephasing) dynamics is considered. Rather surprisingly, it is shown that certain highly-localized initial light distributions can diffuse faster than initial broadly delocalized distributions. The effect is illustrated by considering random walk of optical pulses in fiber-based temporal mesh lattices, which should provide an experimentally-accessible setup for the demonstration of the Mpemba effect in optics.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Networks for Photonic Applications: From Algorithms to Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial-review on applications of artificial neural networks in photonics targets a broad audience, ranging from optical research and engineering communities to computer science and applied mathematics. We focus here on the research areas at the interface between these disciplines, attempting to find the right balance between technical details specific to each domain and overall clarity. First, we briefly recall key properties and peculiarities of some core neural network types, which we believe are the most relevant to photonics, also linking the layer's theoretical design to some photonics hardware realizations. After that, we elucidate the question of how to fine-tune the selected model's design to perform the required task with optimized accuracy. Then, in the review part, we discuss recent developments and progress for several selected applications of neural networks in photonics, including multiple aspects relevant to optical communications, imaging, sensing, and the design of new materials and lasers. In the following section, we put a special emphasis on how to accurately evaluate the complexity of neural networks in the context of the transition from algorithms to hardware implementation. The introduced complexity characteristics are used to analyze the applications of neural networks in optical communications, as a specific, albeit highly important example, comparing those with some benchmark signal processing methods. We combine the description of the well-known model compression strategies used in machine learning, with some novel techniques introduced recently in optical applications of neural networks. It is important to stress that although our focus in this tutorial-review is on photonics, we believe that the methods and techniques presented here can be handy in a much wider range of scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sensitive optical diffractometry method is developed and utilized for advanced tomography of laser-induced air plasma formations. Using transverse diffractometry and Supergaussian plasma distribution modelling we extract the main parameters of the plasma being the plasma density, width and shape with 20 micrometer spatial resolution throughout the plasma formation. The experimentally recorded diffraction patterns fitted by the Supergaussian plasma model are found to capture unprecedentedly delicate traits in the evolution of the plasma from its effective birth and on. Key features in the spatial evolution of the plasma such as the 'escape position', the 'turning point' and the refocusing dynamics of the beam are identified and explored in details. Our work provides experimental and theoretical access into the highly nonlinear dynamics of laser-induced air plasma.</description>

      <title>Wave Interpolation Neural Operator: Interpolated Prediction of Electric Fields Across Untrained Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing photonic structures requires electromagnetic simulations, which often require high computational costs. Researchers have developed surrogate solvers for predicting electric fields to alleviate the computational issues. However, existing surrogate solvers are limited to performing inference at fixed simulation conditions and require retraining for different conditions. To address this, we propose Wave Interpolation Neural Operator (WINO), a novel surrogate solver enabling simulation condition interpolation across a continuous spectrum of broadband wavelengths. WINO introduces the Fourier Group Convolution Shuffling operator and a new conditioning method to efficiently predict electric fields from both trained and untrained wavelength data, achieving significant improvements in parameter efficiency and spectral interpolation performance. Our model demonstrates approximately 100 times faster performance than traditional finite-difference frequency-domain simulations. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art model, we achieve a 74% reduction in parameters and 80.5% improvements in prediction accuracy for untrained wavelengths, and 13.2% improvements for trained wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Single Molecule Spectral Fluctuation Originates from the Variation in Dipole Orientation Connected to Accessible Vibrational Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation in fluorescence emission of immobilized single molecule is typically ascribed to the chromophore's intrinsic structural conformations and the influence of local environmental factors. Despite extensive research over several decades since its initial observation, a direct connection between these spectral fluctuations and the rearrangement of emission dipole orientations has remained elusive. In this study, we elucidate this fundamental molecular behavior and its underlying mechanisms by employing unique single-molecule multi-dimensional tracking to simultaneously monitor both the emission spectrum and the three-dimensional dipole orientation of individual fluorophore. For the first time, we present compelling evidence demonstrating a correlation between spectral fluctuations and dipolar rearrangements at room temperature. Our observations reveal that variations in the radiative relaxation probabilities among different vibronic emission bands, coupled with the interaction of associated vibrational modes, drive these spectral fluctuations. We identify significant out-of-plane dipole reorientations during pronounced spectral fluctuations - commonly known as spectral jumps - which primarily arise from transitions between dominant vibrational modes. Furthermore, we emphasize the potential for con-structing vibrational spectra and optical nanoscopy with vibrational specificity, leveraging the vibronic emissions from single emitters.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Berry phase under the tunneling barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, a quantum wavepacket may acquire a geometrical phase as it evolves along a cyclic trajectory in parameter space. In condensed matter systems, the Berry phase plays a crucial role in fundamental phenomena such as the Hall effect, orbital magnetism, and polarization. Resolving the quantum nature of these processes commonly requires sensitive quantum techniques, as tunneling, being the dominant mechanism in STM microscopy and tunneling transport devices. In this study, we integrate these two phenomena - geometrical phases and tunneling - and observe a complex-valued Berry phase via strong field light matter interactions in condensed matter systems. By manipulating the tunneling barrier, with attoseconds precision, we measure the imaginary Berry phase accumulated as the electron tunnels during a fraction of the optical cycle. Our work opens new theoretical and experimental directions in geometrical phases physics and their realization in condensed matter systems, expanding solid state strong field light metrology to study topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Single-photon interference over 8.4 km urban atmosphere: towards testing quantum effect in curved spacetime with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum mechanics and general relativity has transformed our understanding of the natural world significantly. However, integrating these two theories presents immense challenges, and their interplay remains untested. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the single-photon interference covering huge space can effectively probe the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. We developed an alternative design using unbalanced Michelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an 8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based on quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this long-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad, which satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at the geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation. Our results confirm the feasibility of the single-photon version of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment for testing the quantum effects in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Comb and Switch using parallel chains of non-identical Micro-Ring Resonators</title>

Abstract: Micro-Ring Resonators (MRRs) allow us to access the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect at a variety of tunable parameter combinations along exact analytic solutions. This higher-dimensional space of parameters for which the HOM effect occurs constitutes what is known as a Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold (HOMM). Using a parallel series of non-identical MRRs and changing relative round-trip phase shifts between MRRs allows for the manipulation of the wavelength locations of the HOM effect. Through clever design and fabrication, we can mold the HOMM to place the HOM effect, or lack thereof, precisely at desired locations. In this paper we discuss how to adjust non-identical MRR parameters to change the resulting HOMM. We also promote example designs that exhibit advantageous HOMM structures, and highlight some of the myriad of possibilities that can be accessed with different circuit design. Finally, we show a wavelength division multiplexer example that matches the HOM effect locations with the already established channels to integrate with a classical communication network.</description>

      <title>Topological Protection of Optical Skyrmions through Complex Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical Skyrmions have many important properties that make them ideal units for high-density data applications, including the ability to carry digital information through a discrete topological number and the independence of spatially varying polarization to other dimensions. More importantly, the topological nature of the optical Skyrmion heuristically suggests a strong degree of robustness to perturbations, which is crucial for reliably carrying information in noisy environments. However, the study of the topological robustness of optical Skyrmions is still in its infancy. Here, we quantify this robustness precisely by proving that the topological nature of the Skyrmion arises from its structure on the boundary and, by duality, is therefore resilient to complex perturbations provided they respect the relevant boundary conditions of the unperturbed Skyrmion. We then present experimental evidence validating this robustness in the context of paraxial Skyrmion beams against different polarization aberrations. Our work provides a framework for handling various perturbations of Skyrmion fields and offers guarantees of robustness in a general sense. This, in turn, has implications for applications of the optical Skyrmion where their topological nature is exploited explicitly, and, in particular, provides an underpinning for the use of Skyrmions in optical communications and photonic computing.</description>

Abstract: Control over the amplitude, phase, and spatial distribution of visible-spectrum light underlies many technologies, but commercial solutions remain bulky, require high control power, and are often too slow. Active integrated photonics for visible light promises a solution, especially with recent materials and fabrication advances. In this review, we discuss three growing application spaces which rely on control of visible light: control and measurement of atomic quantum technologies, augmented-reality displays, and measurement and control of biological systems. We then review the commercial dynamic surfaces and bulk systems which currently provide visible-light modulation and the current state-of-the-art integrated solutions. Throughout the review we focus on speed, control power, size, optical bandwidth, and technological maturity when comparing technologies.</description>

      <title>Edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening the bandgap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we characterize the dispersion of edge states, examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience towards various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. The considered design opens novel possibilities in constructing optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <title>Unlocking new dimensions in photonic computing using optical Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decline of Moore's law coupled with the growing dominance of artificial intelligence has recently motivated research into photonic computing as a high-bandwidth, low-power strategy to accelerate digital electronics. However, modern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them susceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion offers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form of a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical field. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical Skyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic computing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of performing perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of optical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental evidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly achieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.</description>

      <title>Broadband THz wave generation and detection in organic crystal PNPA at MHz repetition rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals have emerged as efficient room-temperature emitters of broadband THz radiation with high electric field strengths. Although initially confined to high-pulse-energy excitation in the millijoule range with kHz rates, recent efforts have focused on tailoring the physical properties of organic NLO materials for compatibility with popular MHz-rate telecommunication wavelength lasers emitting nanojoule energy pulses. This is motivated by the large potential of such crystals for more portable and user-safe spectroscopic systems, additionally complemented by their room-temperature field-sensitive THz detection capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate the MHz-rate operation of the organic crystal PNPA ((E)-4-((4-nitrobenzylidene)amino)-$N$-phenylaniline), which was recently discovered through data mining algorithms and reported to surpass the conversion efficiency of rivaling NLO crystals at 1 kHz repetition rate. Using a compact 200 mW Er:fiber laser producing 18 fs pulses at 50 MHz repetition rate, we demonstrate the THz field generation and detection capabilities of PNPA via performing gas phase spectroscopy in the 1.3-8.5 THz range. We obtain a dynamic range of 40 dB over 3.6 s and 70 dB over 2 hours. Our work extends the family of organic crystals compatible with telecommunication-wavelength excitation using nJ pulses for spectroscopy beyond 5 THz.</description>

      <title>Optomechanics of optically-levitated particles: A tutorial and perspective</title>

Abstract: Optomechanics, the study of the mechanical interaction of light with matter, has proven to be a fruitful area of research that has yielded many notable achievements, including the direct detection of gravitational waves in kilometer-scale optical interferometers. Light has been used to cool and demonstrate quantum control over the mechanical degrees of freedom of individual ions and atoms, and more recently has facilitated the observation of quantum ``mechanics'' in objects of larger mass, even at the kg-scale. Optical levitation, where an object can be suspended by radiation pressure and largely decoupled from its environment, has recently established itself as a rich field of study, with many notable results relevant for precision measurement, quantum information science, and foundational tests of quantum mechanics and fundamental physics. This article provides a survey of several current activities in field along with a tutorial describing associated key concepts and methods, both from an experimental and theoretical approach. It is intended as a resource for junior researchers who are new to this growing field as well as beginning graduate students. The tutorial is concluded with a perspective on both promising emerging experimental platforms and anticipated future theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Weyl points on non-orientable manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl fermions are hypothetical chiral particles that can also manifest as excitations near three-dimensional band crossing points in lattice systems. These quasiparticles are subject to the Nielsen-Ninomiya "no-go" theorem when placed on a lattice, requiring the total chirality across the Brillouin zone to vanish. This constraint results from the topology of the (orientable) manifold on which they exist. Here, we ask to what extent the concepts of topology and chirality of Weyl points remain well-defined when the underlying manifold is non-orientable. We show that the usual notion of chirality becomes ambiguous in this setting, allowing for systems with a non-zero total chirality. This circumvention of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem stems from a generic discontinuity of the vector field whose zeros are Weyl points. Furthermore, we discover that Weyl points on non-orientable manifolds carry an additional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant which satisfies a different no-go theorem. We implement such Weyl points by imposing a non-symmorphic symmetry in the momentum space of lattice models. Finally, we experimentally realize all aspects of their phenomenology in a photonic platform with synthetic momenta. Our work highlights the subtle but crucial interplay between the topology of quasiparticles and of their underlying manifold.</description>

Abstract: Single-photon emitters integrated in optical micro-cavities are key elements in quantum communication applications. However, optimizing their emission properties and achieving efficient cavity coupling remain significant challenges. In this study, we investigate semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) emitting in the telecom O-band and integrate them in an open fiber-cavity. Such cavities offer spatial and spectral tunability and intrinsic fiber-coupling. The design promises high collection efficiency and enables the investigation of multiple emitters in heterogeneous samples. We observe a reduction of the decay times of several individual emitters by up to a factor of $2.46(2)$ due to the Purcell effect. We comprehensively analyze the current limitations of the system, including cavity and emitter properties, the impact of the observed regime where cavity and emitter linewidths are comparable, as well as the mechanical fluctuations of the cavity length. The results elucidate the path towards efficient telecom quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ultrastrong driving of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O by a microwave field. The effect of the field is studied using optical absorption spectroscopy, and through the observation of sidebands on the transmitted laser light. A model based on Floquet theory is constructed to study the system beyond the rotating wave approximation. We obtain near quantitative agreement between theory and experiment across a 16-fold range of microwave field strengths spanning from the perturbative to the ultrastrong driving regime. Compared to Rydberg atoms, the large non-radiative widths of Rydberg excitons leads to new behaviour such as the emergence of an absorption continuum without ionization.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: A Theoretical Framework for Enhancing or Enabling Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes Interaction and Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>
