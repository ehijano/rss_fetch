      <title>Unexpected collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.</description>

      <title>Magneto transport of pressure induced flatbands in large angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle ($\sim 1.1^\circ$), leading to strong electron correlations and emergent quantum phases such as superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, beyond the magic angle, the band structure generally remains dispersive, diminishing interaction-driven phenomena. In this work, we explore the equivalence between pressure-induced flatbands and the magic-angle flatband in large-angle TBG by systematically analyzing the role of interlayer coupling modifications under perpendicular pressure. We show that pressure-induced flatbands exhibit spatial localization similar to magic-angle TBG, with charge density concentrated in the AA-stacked regions. Furthermore, the Hall conductivity and magneto-transport properties under an external magnetic field reveal that these pressure-induced flatbands share key signatures with the quantum Hall response of magic-angle TBG. The obtained Hofstadter spectrum shows four consistent low-energy gaps across all twist angles under pressure, which align with the calculated Hall conductivity plateaus. Our findings suggest that pressure offers an alternative pathway to engineer flat electronic bands and correlated states in TBG, extending the landscape of tunable moir\'e materials beyond the constraints of the magic angle.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Second Landau Level PH-Pfaffian State to the Lowest Landau Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we proposed a state described by the second Landau level (SLL) projection of the antiholomorphic Pfaffian wavefunction as a candidate for the ground state of the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we provide a mathematical proof that, when mapped to the lowest Landau level (LLL), the aforementioned state, which we call the SLL PH-Pfaffian state, becomes exactly a LLL projected orbital angular momentum l = -3 pairing Pfaffian state, which we call the LLL antiholomorphic f-wave pairing Pfaffian state, or the LLL af-Pfaffian state for short. We further prove that there is also an exact mapping between the upstream neutral Majorana fermion edge mode of the SLL PH-Pfaffian state and that of the LLL af-Pfaffian state. However, we find that while there exists an upstream neutral boson edge mode in the LLL af-Pfaffian state, it has no mapped counterpart in the SLL PH-Pfaffian state.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of nonlinear spin-wave propagation using diamond quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior due to the competition between excitation and relaxation at large amplitudes, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. We image the nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase in varying excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, modulation of the wavenumber is observed across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to the spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Coupling molecular spin qubits with 2D magnets for coherent magnon manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonics is an emerging field widely considered as a paradigm shift in information technology that uses spin waves for data storage, processing and transmission. However, the coherent control of spin waves in 2D magnets still remains a challenge. Herein, we investigate the interplay between molecular spins and magnons in hybrid heterostructures formed by [CpTi(cot)] and VOPc spin qubits deposited on the surface of the air-stable 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr using first principles. Our results show that different molecular rotation configurations significantly impact on qubit relaxation time and alter the magnon spectra of the underlying 2D magnet, allowing the chemical coherent control of spin waves in this material. We predict the feasibility of an ultrafast magnon-qubit interface with minimized decoherence, where exchange coupling plays a crucial role. This work opens new avenues for hybrid quantum magnonics, enabling selective tailoring through a versatile chemical approach.</description>

      <title>Control of the magnetic hopfion lattice in helimagnet with the external field and anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized micromagnetic model of hopfions in a helimagnet with a two-dimensional (allowing both radial and azimuthal dependence) profile function is considered. Calculations confirm the elliptical stability of hopfions and the previously obtained analytical expression for the upper critical field of their lattice. Dependencies of the hopfion lattice periods on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant of the material are obtained. It is shown that in an anisotropic helimagnet, the hopfion lattice has a layered (graphite-like) layout, which can be controlled by the external field and the uniaxial anisotropy.</description>

      <title>A semiclassical nonequilibrium Green's Function approach to electron transport in systems exhibiting electron-phonon couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a semiclassical theory for electron transport in open quantum systems with electron-phonon interactions adequate for situations when the system's phonon dynamics is comparable with the electron transport timescale. Starting from the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we obtain equations of motion for the retarded and lesser electronic Green's functions including contributions due to the phonon dynamics up to second order in the electron-phonon coupling strength. The resulting equations assume that the system's phonon follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron-phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in phase and anti-phase driving. Our results illustrate that our method provides an efficient protocol to describe the effects of nuclear motion in ultrafast transient phenomena.</description>

      <title>Two-electron edge states in a double SSH-chain of quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an interacting two-body model with adjustable spin tunneling in the context of the double SSH chains for a quantum dot system. We discovered that varying interaction strengths and spin tunneling significantly influence the properties of correlated edge states in the energy spectrum obtained through exact diagonalization. We observe that stronger interactions lead to longer decay lengths of these states. Conversely, the decay length decreases as the difference in intracell or intercell tunneling increases. Importantly, the decay length is strongly correlated with the dynamical behavior of two particles; specifically, an increase in decay length corresponds to a decrease in motion frequency. This conclusion is supported by the observation of the expectation value of coordinate operators of the particles.</description>

      <title>Exchange cross-talk mitigation in dense quantum dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum computing and simulations of complex many-body phenomena. However, on the path of scale-up, cross-talk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe challenge. While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely compensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult to tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and implement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent exchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge. We show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element without knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array. We uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be linked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate the methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology should be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor platforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is present or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well suited for automated tuning routines as we obtain a stand-out feature that can be easily tracked and directly returns the magnitude of the cross-talk.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Spin-Singlet QuBit in a Triangulene Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-$1$ chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a superconducting spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we find a manifold of two lowest-lying, isolated spin-singlet states that undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random-field noise and quasi-particle poisoning. We also introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</description>

      <title>Plasmons in N-layer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szeg\H{o} Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Enhances Self-Healing for Non-Hermitian Topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces and analyzes a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model generalized through spin-dependent non-Abelian SU(2) gauge couplings. By incorporating SU(2) symmetry transformations that couple explicitly to spin degrees of freedom, our model demonstrates distinct topological properties originating from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and gauge-induced spin-orbit coupling. Exact diagonalization and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) analyses reveal distinct spectral phases, characterized by complex-energy loops under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and substantial localization indicative of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundary conditions (OBC). We define a gauge-invariant winding number for non-Hermitian chiral symmetry, clarifying the topological transitions. Furthermore, we uncover a novel self-healing phenomenon in response to dynamically introduced scattering potentials, showing significant robustness enhancement induced by appropriate non-Abelian SU(2) couplings. These findings clarify how non-Abelian gauge interactions can control spin-dependent localization and dynamical stability in non-Hermitian topological systems, guiding the development of tunable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Contrasting exchange-field and spin-transfer torque driving mechanisms in all-electric electron spin resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Low-energy electron microscopy as a tool for analysis of self-assembled molecular layers on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) is a surface science method that works primarily in the UHV environment. It provides information complementary to the other established techniques: it extends the limited view of scanning probe microscopies from nanometers to micrometers and measurement time down to tens of milliseconds, enabling to visualize the changes during sample treatment, e.g., annealing, deposition, and gas or light exposure. From the point of structural analysis, it allows the measurement of diffraction patterns from an area of diameter below 200 nm and imaging of phase distribution on the surfaces either through dark-filed imaging or LEEM-I(V) fingerprinting. The advanced modes provide local angle-resolved photoelectron spectra and surface potential distribution. In this review, we aim to describe the utilization of LEEM to study self-assembled molecular structures on solid surfaces. We present the LEEM instrumentation and analysis of measured data in a tutorial way to provide the necessary background knowledge to enter the field. In the second part, we summarize the knowledge obtained by LEEM for several selected systems, which points to the strength of LEEM in understanding the self-assembled molecular systems and its synergy with other surface science techniques.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Assisted Random Lasing of Perovskite Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random lasing occurs as the result of coherent optical feedback from random scattering centers. Plasmonic nanostructures, such as silver or gold nanoparticles, efficiently scatter light due to the formation of hot spots and optical confinement at the nanoscale. In this work, using silver nanocubes as highly efficient light scattering centers, a broad band plasmon assisted lasing action of halide perovskite materials is demonstrated. By embedding silver nanocubes in CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 solutions, narrow bandwidth lasing modes with a full width at half-maximum of approximately 1 nm are supported. It is observed that the lasing thresholds of perovskites are different for glass and gold substrates, and for different nanocube concentrations. Results of time-resolved measurements indicate a significant shortening in the decay time of the emission at above the lasing threshold, implying a stimulated emission process. The results of this work thus provide a pathway to generate coherent light sources from widely studied perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>Concept and Demonstration of a Low-cost Compact Electron Microscope Enabled by a Photothermionic Carbon Nanotube Cathode</title>

Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) delivers high resolution, high depth of focus and an image quality as if microscopic objects are seen by the naked eye. This makes it not only a powerful scientific instrument, but a tool inherently applicable to nearly all fields of study and curiosity involving the small scale. However, SEMs have remained complex, expensive, and beyond the reach of many. To broaden access, we demonstrate an SEM using simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf components, and hobby-level electromechanics; this has been enabled by a unique thermionic electron source based on a carbon nanotube array excited by low optical power. The instrument offers sub-micrometer resolution, a depth of focus of several hundred micrometers, and an image quality comparable to commercial SEMs; it also tolerates poor vacuum and moist specimens, making it broadly applicable. It has a flexible design that lends itself to easy customization for different use scenarios. We provide the conceptual approach and high-level design in this paper; the detailed blueprints of our specific implementation will be provided separately online. We hope that specialists and non-specialists alike will build variations that fit their own needs and interests, helping electron microscopy expand into diverse new sectors of society and industry.</description>

      <title>Extremely high excitonic $g$-factors in 2D crystals by alloy-induced admixing of band states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (\mbox{S-TMDs}) emit light very efficiently and display rich spin-valley physics, with gyromagnetic ($g$-) factors of about -4. Here, we investigate how these properties can be tailored by alloying. Magneto-optical spectroscopy is used to reveal the peculiar properties of excitonic complexes in Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ MLs with different Mo and W concentrations. We show that the alloys feature extremely high $g$-factors for neutral excitons, that change gradually with the composition up to reaching values of the order of -10 for $x \approx 0.2$. First-principles calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide evidence that alloying in S-TMDs results in a non-trivial band structure engineering, being at the origin of the high $g$-factors. The theoretical framework also suggests a higher strain sensitivity of the alloys, making them promising candidates for tailor-made optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Single Ultrabright Fluorescent Silica Nanoparticles Can Be Used as Individual Fast Real-Time Nanothermometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical-based nanothermometry represents a transformative approach for precise temperature measurements at the nanoscale, which finds versatile applications across biology, medicine, and electronics. The assembly of ratiometric fluorescent 40 nm nanoparticles designed to serve as individual nanothermometers is introduced here. These nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity (11% /K) and temperature resolution 128 \, \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2} \cdot \mathrm{W} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}, outperforming existing optical nanothermometers by factors of 2-6 and 455, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the encapsulation of fluorescent molecules with high density inside the mesoporous matrix. It becomes possible after incorporating hydrophobic groups into the silica matrix, which effectively prevents water ingress and dye leaking. A practical application of these nanothermometers is demonstrated using confocal microscopy, showcasing their ability to map temperature distributions accurately. This methodology is compatible with any fluorescent microscope capable of recording dual fluorescent channels in any transparent medium or on a sample surface. This work not only sets a new benchmark for optical nano-thermometry but also provides a relatively simple yet powerful tool for exploring thermal phenomena at the nanoscale across various scientific domains.</description>

Abstract: Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces JAX-BTE, a GPU-accelerated, differentiable solver for the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) based on differentiable programming. JAX-BTE enables accurate, efficient and differentiable multiscale thermal modeling by leveraging high-performance GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The solver efficiently addresses the high-dimensional and complex integro-differential nature of the phonon BTE, facilitating both forward simulations and data-augmented inverse simulations through end-to-end optimization. Validation is performed across a range of 1D to 3D simulations, including complex FinFET structures, in both forward and inverse settings, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability. JAX-BTE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BTE solvers in forward simulations and uniquely enables inverse simulations, making it a powerful tool for multiscale thermal analysis and design for semiconductor devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals for the realization of time-reversal symmetry breaking and topological superconductivity in twisted nodal superconductors have led to a surge of theoretical and experimental studies of these systems, marking one of the newest entries in the rapidly growing field of moir\'e materials. The interplay between order parameters of the separate layers makes twisted superconductors unique, leading to additional emergent phenomena in regimes usually not of importance in moir\'e physics, such as bulk interfaces and large twist angles. We review the physics of twisted nodal superconductors, highlighting both similarities and qualitative differences with other moir\'e platforms. While inspired by the rise of moir\'e materials, the field is anchored in studies of unconventional superconductivity preceding the moir\'e era, which we discuss in detail. In addition to summarizing the developments at the present stage, we present a detailed outlook on the major open questions in the field and some of the most exciting future directions.</description>

      <title>Realization of a non-Hermitian Haldane model in circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Haldane model is the simplest yet most powerful topological lattice model exhibiting various phases, including the Dirac semimetal phase and the anomalous quantum Hall phase (also known as the Chern insulator). Although considered unlikely to be physically directly realizable in condensed matter systems, it has been experimentally demonstrated in other physical settings such as cold atoms, where Hermiticity is usually preserved. Extending this model to the non-Hermitian regime with energy non-conservation can significantly enrich topological phases that lack Hermitian counterparts; however, such exploration remains experimentally challenging due to the lack of suitable physical platforms. Here, based on electric circuits, we report the experimental realization of a genuine non-Hermitian Haldane model with asymmetric next-nearest-neighbor hopping. We observe two previously uncovered phases: a non-Hermitian Chern insulator and a non-Hermitian semimetal phase, both exhibiting boundary-dependent amplifying or dissipative chiral edge states. Our work paves the way for exploring non-Hermiticity-induced unconventional topological phases in the Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Theorem for Low-Dimensional Electron Systems with Off-Diagonal Effective Mass Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of electrons under homogeneously applied electric fields in low-dimensional systems with non-zero off-diagonal effective mass (ODEM) is studied. The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.</description>

      <title>Effect of Interlayer Stacking on the Electronic Properties of 1$T$-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled stacking of van der Waals materials is a powerful tool for exploring the physics of quantum condensed matter. Given the small binding between layers, exploitation for engineering will require a breakthrough in stacking methodology, or an ability to take advantage of thicker defective stacks. Here we describe computational groundwork for the latter, using -- on account of its promise for cold memory applications -- 1$T$-TaS$_2$ as a model system. Comparing recursive Hendricks-Teller calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to published X-ray diffraction data, we obtain the key parameters describing the random stacking in mesoscopic flakes. These then regulate the electronic structures via specification of the random stacks in dynamical mean-field theory simulations. Hubbard repulsion induces strongly correlated metallic, band and Mott insulating layers, providing compelling evidence that electronic properties follow from the coexistence of more than the metallic and insulating planes associated by ordinary band theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal transport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures focusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism has been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based on ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric effects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry of the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction. Recently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that emerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced applications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and altermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal and charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary superconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been explored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers has been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials, including Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally biased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in recent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and various other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large thermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications in superconductor-based thermal device components.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Corbino Shockley-Ramo Paradox for Hydrodynamic Current Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Johnson noise thermometry enables direct measurement of the electron temperature, a valuable probe of many-body systems. Practical use of this technique calls for non-equilibrium generalizations of the Johnson-Nyquist theorem. For a hydrodynamic Corbino device, however, a na\"ive use of the Shockley-Ramo theorem alongside the "Corbino paradox" leads to yet another paradox: bulk velocity fluctuations cannot be measured by the contacts. In this work, we resolve the unphysical "Corbino Shockley-Ramo paradox" by correctly formulating the hydrodynamic Shockley-Ramo problem. This allows us to properly formulate the problem of current noise in an hydrodynamic multi-terminal device of arbitrary geometry, as well as validate a previously unjustified assumption for rectangular geometry results. As an example, we compute the Johnson noise in a hydrodynamic Corbino device, where we find a suppression of Johnson noise with magnetic field. This unusual characteristic serves as a strong signature of viscous hydrodynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Imaging moir\'e flat bands and Wigner molecular crystals in twisted bilayer MoTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting moir\'e materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Recently, tMoTe2 has attracted significant attentions due to the observation of the long-sought fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the tMoTe2 moir\'e superlattice remains elusive. Here, we report STM/STS studies in dual-gated tMoTe2 moir\'e devices with twist angles ranging from 2.3 to 3.8 deg. The device consists of two independent back-gates, one enables an ohmic contact for tMoTe2, while the other fine-tunes the Fermi level of tMoTe2. This dual-gate control enables direct measurement of the electronic structure in tMoTe2 under varied displacement fields and moir\'e filling factors, by fine tuning the gate voltage and the tip bias. Our STS spectra and spatial imaging reveal that the low-energy moir\'e flat bands are predominantly localized in the XM and MX regions of the moir\'e superlattice. At zero E-field, these bands form a honeycomb lattice with non-trivial topology, whereas an applied E-field drives a transition into two distinct triangular lattices with trivial topology. The spatial distributions align with large-scale first-principle calculations, demonstrating that the topological flat bands arise from the K-valley hybridization between the top and bottom MoTe2 layers. Furthermore, we show that the effective moir\'e potential depth can be controlled via gate and tip biases. At sufficient potential depths, we observe the emergence of Wigner molecular crystals, transitioning MX triangular lattice into a Kagome lattice at MX moir\'e filling factor 3. These results elucidate the microscopic origin of topological flat bands in tMoTe2 and demonstrate electric-field control of topology and correlated electronic orders, paving the way to engineer exotic quantum phases in moir\'e simulators.</description>

Abstract: The hallmark of topological crystalline insulators is the emergence of a robust electronic state in a bandgap localized at the boundary of the material. However, end, edge, and surface states can also have a nontopological origin. Unfortunately, topological invariants such as the winding number and Zak phase are often not directly experimentally accessible for solids. In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provides a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the internal structure of the charge-density-wave state in CeSbTe</title>

Abstract: The collective reorganization of electrons into a charge density wave has long served as a textbook example of an ordered phase in condensed matter physics. Two-dimensional square lattices with $p$ electrons are well-suited to the realization of charge density waves, due to the anisotropy of the $p$ orbitals and the resulting one dimensionality of the electronic structure. In spite of a long history of study of charge density waves in square-lattice systems, few reports have recognized the significance of a hidden orbital degree of freedom. The degeneracy of $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons may give rise to orbital patterns in real space that endow the charge density wave with additional broken symmetries or unusual order parameters. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the internal structure of the charge-density-wave state of CeSbTe, which contains Sb square lattices with 5$p$ electrons. We image atomic-sized, anisotropic lobes of charge density with periodically modulating anisotropy, which we interpret in terms of a superposition of $p_x$ and $p_y$ bond density waves. Our results support the fact that delocalized $p$ orbitals can reorganize into emergent electronic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Strongly hybridized phonons in one-dimensional van der Waals crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomena of pronounced electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in one-dimensional (1D) systems are ubiquitous, which are well described by frameworks of Luttinger liquid, Peierls instability and concomitant charge density wave. However, the experimental observation of strongly hybridized phonons in 1D was not demonstrated. Herein we report the first observation of strongly hybridized phonons in 1D condensed matters by using double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), representative 1D van der Waals crystals, with combining the spectroscopic and microscopic tools as well as the ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We observe uncharted phonon modes in one commensurate and three incommensurate DWNT crystals, three of which concurrently exhibit strongly-reconstructed electronic band structures. Our DFT calculations for the experimentally observed commensurate DWNT (7,7) @ (12,12) reveal that this new phonon mode originates from a (nearly) degenerate coupling between two transverse acoustic modes (ZA modes) of constituent inner and outer nanotubes having approximately trigonal and pentagonal rotational symmetry along the nanotube circumferences. Such coupling strongly hybridizes the two phonon modes in different shells and leads to the formation of a unique lattice motion featuring evenly distributed vibrational amplitudes over inner and outer nanotubes, distinct from any known phonon modes in 1D systems. All four DWNTs that exhibit the pronounced new phonon modes show small chiral angle twists, closely matched diameter ratios of 3/5 and decreased frequencies of new phonon modes with increased diameters, all supporting the uncovered coupling mechanism. Our discovery of strongly hybridized phonons in DWNTs open new opportunities for engineering phonons and exploring novel phonon-related phenomena in 1D condensed matters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall effect in non-magnetic and Mn-doped HgTe quantum well is strongly affected by Kondo scattering of edge electrons by holes localized on acceptors. A generalized eigenvalue method is usually employed for determining impurity binding energies from the multiband Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonians in bulk samples and semiconductor quantum structures. Such an approach provides accurate values of the level positions but its applicability for determining the impurity localization radius can be questioned. As an alternative method we propose here the Gram-Schmidt ortogonalization procedure allowing to employ the standard eigenvalue algorithms and, thus, to determine both impurity level energies and the set of normalized eigenvectors. We apply this approach to singly-ionized acceptor states in HgTe quantum wells and obtain impurity level energies and localization radiuses even for states degenerate with the continuum of band states. Such information allows us to assess the energy of bound magnetic polarons in quantum wells doped with magnetic ions. We determine the polaron energies and discuss consequences of the resonant polaron formation on band transport in the bulk samples and quantum wells in the regimes of quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy &lt; 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultrastrong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhances the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing the cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in the antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and impose a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade for quantum information technology in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order from the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new classes of gapped topological phases characterized by quantized crystalline-electromagnetic responses, termed "multipolar Chern insulators". These systems are characterized by nonsymmorphic momentum-space symmetries and mirror symmetries, leading to quantization of momentum-weighted Berry curvature multipole moments. We construct lattice models for such phases and confirm their quantized responses through numerical calculations. These systems exhibit bound charge and momentum densities at lattice and magnetic defects, and currents induced by electric or time-varying strain fields. Our work extends the classification of topological matter by uncovering novel symmetry-protected topological phases with quantized responses.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin Hall effect is usually realized in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry, but whether it can be realized without symmetry protection remains unexplored. Here, we propose type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with quantized spin Hall conductivity, whose edge states with opposite chirality and polarization, distributed in different Brillouin zone regions, connect the conduction and valence bands at the boundary. Thus, the type-II quantum spin Hall insulator does not require any symmetry protection other than translational symmetry. Then, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that type-II quantum spin Hall insulator can be realized in both altermagnetic materials and Luttinger compensated magnetic materials. Furthermore, based on lattice model, we find that as long as $U(1)$ symmetry exists, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase can always exist stably. However, if $U(1)$ symmetry is broken, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase transforms into an obstructed atomic insulator phase as spin-orbit coupling effect is enhanced. Therefore, our work not only proposes a new mechanism for realizing the quantum spin Hall effect, but also enriches the types of unconventional magnetic topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.</description>

Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <title>Corrugation-dominated mechanical softening of defect-engineered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (&lt; 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically-exact algorithm using few-body revealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>
