      <title>Deep Learning in Wireless Communication Receiver: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of wireless communication receivers to enhance signal processing in complex and dynamic environments is going through a transformation by leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs). Traditional wireless receivers depend on mathematical models and algorithms, which do not have the ability to adapt or learn from data. In contrast, deep learning-based receivers are more suitable for modern wireless communication systems because they can learn from data and adapt accordingly. This survey explores various deep learning architectures such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and autoencoders, focusing on their application in the design of wireless receivers. Key modules of a receiver such as synchronization, channel estimation, equalization, space-time decoding, demodulation, decoding, interference cancellation, and modulation classification are discussed in the context of advanced wireless technologies like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multiple input multiple output (MIMO), semantic communication, task-oriented communication, and next-generation (Next-G) networks. The survey not only emphasizes the potential of deep learning-based receivers in future wireless communication but also investigates different challenges of deep learning-based receivers, such as data availability, security and privacy concerns, model interpretability, computational complexity, and integration with legacy systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Lagrange Encoding for Storage and Download in Elastic Computing for Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded elastic computing enables virtual machines to be preempted for high-priority tasks while allowing new virtual machines to join ongoing computation seamlessly. This paper addresses coded elastic computing for matrix-matrix multiplications with straggler tolerance by encoding both storage and download using Lagrange codes. In 2018, Yang et al. introduced the first coded elastic computing scheme for matrix-matrix multiplications, achieving a lower computational load requirement. However, this scheme lacks straggler tolerance and suffers from high upload cost. Zhong et al. (2023) later tackled these shortcomings by employing uncoded storage and Lagrange-coded download. However, their approach requires each machine to store the entire dataset. This paper introduces a new class of elastic computing schemes that utilize Lagrange codes to encode both storage and download, achieving a reduced storage size. The proposed schemes efficiently mitigate both elasticity and straggler effects, with a storage size reduced to a fraction $\frac{1}{L}$ of Zhong et al.'s approach, at the expense of doubling the download cost. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed schemes on AWS EC2 by measuring computation time under two different tasks allocations: heterogeneous and cyclic assignments. Both assignments minimize computation redundancy of the system while distributing varying computation loads across machines.</description>

      <title>Randomized Scheduling for Periodic Multi-Source Systems with PAoI Violation Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) has been recognized as a critical metric for assessing the freshness of information in modern communication systems. In this work, we examine an information update system where multiple information sources transmit updates to their respective destinations via a shared base station. Our main contribution is the proposal of a randomized scheduling algorithm that offers distinct statistical AoI guarantees for heterogeneous sources. Specifically, we rigorously derive an analytical upper bound on peak age of information (PAoI) violation probability by leveraging properties of the multivariate noncentral hypergeometric Wallenius distribution. Building on these analytical results, two designs of coefficients for the randomized policy are proposed to meet the outage constraints for all sources, tailored to the long and short sampling delay cases, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis on PAoI violation probability and also show that our proposed design always provides a feasible solution in most cases.</description>

      <title>Remote State Estimation over a Wearing Channel: Information Freshness vs. Channel Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the remote estimation of a linear Gaussian system over a nonstationary channel that wears out over time and with every use. The sensor can either transmit a fresh measurement in the current time slot, restore the channel quality at the cost of downtime, or remain silent. More frequent transmissions yield accurate estimates but incur significant wear on the channel. Renewing the channel too often improves channel conditions but results in poor estimation quality. What is the optimal timing to transmit measurements and restore the channel? We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and show the monotonicity properties of an optimal policy. A structured policy iteration algorithm is proposed to find the optimal policy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Channel- and Coding-Based Challenge-Response Physical-Layer Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a new physical layer authentication mechanism operating at the physical layer of a communication system where the receiver has partial control of the channel conditions (e.g., using an intelligent reflecting surface). We aim to exploit both instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and a secret shared key for authentication. This is achieved by both transmitting an identifying key by wiretap coding (to conceal the key from the attacker) and checking that the instantaneous CSI corresponds to the channel configuration randomly selected by the receiver. We investigate the trade-off between the pilot signals used for CSI estimation and the coding rate (or key length) to improve the overall security of the authentication procedure.</description>

      <title>Information Theory for Expectation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon based his information theory on the notion of probability measures as it we developed by Kolmogorov. In this paper we study some fundamental problems in information theory based on expectation measures. In the theory of expectation measures it is natural to study data sets where no randomness is present and it is also natural to study information theory for point processes as well as sampling where the sample size is not fixed. Expectation measures in combination with Kraft's Inequality can be used to clarify in which cases probability measures can be used to quantify randomness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stochastic Polar Decoder With Correlated Stochastic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar codes have gained significant attention in channel coding for their ability to approach the capacity of binary input discrete memoryless channels (B-DMCs), thanks to their reliability and efficiency in transmission. However, existing decoders often struggle to balance hardware area and performance. Stochastic computing offers a way to simplify circuits, and previous work has implemented decoding using this approach. A common issue with these methods is performance degradation caused by the introduction of correlation. This paper presents an Efficient Correlated Stochastic Polar Decoder (ECS-PD) that fundamentally addresses the issue of the `hold-state', preventing it from increasing as correlation computation progresses. We propose two optimization strategies aimed at reducing iteration latency, increasing throughput, and simplifying the circuit to improve hardware efficiency. The optimization can reduce the number of iterations by 25.2% at $E_b/N_0$ = 3 dB. Compared to other efficient designs, the proposed ECS-PD achieves higher throughput and is 2.7 times more hardware-efficient than the min-sum decoder.</description>

      <title>Source-Channel Separation Theorems for Distortion Perception Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that separation between lossy source coding and channel coding is asymptotically optimal under classical additive distortion measures. Recently, coding under a new class of quality considerations, often referred to as perception or realism, has attracted significant attention due to its close connection to neural generative models and semantic communications. In this work, we revisit source-channel separation under the consideration of distortion-perception. We show that when the perception quality is measured on the block level, i.e., in the strong-sense, the optimality of separation still holds when common randomness is shared between the encoder and the decoder; however, separation is no longer optimal when such common randomness is not available. In contrast, when the perception quality is the average per-symbol measure, i.e., in the weak-sense, the optimality of separation holds regardless of the availability of common randomness.</description>

      <title>On decoding hyperbolic codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies several decoding algorithms for hyperbolic codes. We use some previous ideas to describe how to decode a hyperbolic code using the largest Reed-Muller code contained in it or using the smallest Reed-Muller code that contains it. A combination of these two algorithms is proposed when hyperbolic codes are defined by polynomials in two variables. Then, we compare hyperbolic codes and Cube codes (tensor product of Reed-Solomon codes) and propose decoding algorithms of hyperbolic codes based on their closest Cube codes. Finally, we adapt to hyperbolic codes the Geil and Matsumoto's generalization of Sudan's list decoding algorithm.</description>

      <title>Private Information Retrieval on Multigraph-Based Replicated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Modeling and Analysis of UAV Air-Ground Channels at 1 and 4 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the design of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless communications, a better understanding of propagation characteristics and an accurate channel model are required. Measurements and comprehensive analysis for the UAV-based air-ground (AG) propagation channel in the vertical dimension are presented in this letter. Based on the measurement data at 1 and 4 GHz, the large-scale and small-scale channel parameters are extracted in the line-of-sight (LOS) and nonLOS case, respectively. The altitude-dependent path loss model is proposed herein. Furthermore, shadow fading and fast fading are statistically analyzed for comprehensively describing the fading behavior. Our results will be useful in the modeling of AG channels and the performance analysis for UAV-enabled wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Intensional Inheritance Between Concepts: An Information-Theoretic Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of formalizing and quantifying the concept of "intensional inheritance" between two concepts. We begin by conceiving the intensional inheritance of $W$ from $F$ as the amount of information the proposition "x is $F$ " provides about the proposition "x is $W$. To flesh this out, we consider concepts $F$ and $W$ defined by sets of properties $\left\{F_{1}, F_{2}, \ldots, F_{n}\right\}$ and $\left\{W_{1}, W_{2}, \ldots, W_{m}\right\}$ with associated degrees $\left\{d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots, d_{n}\right\}$ and $\left\{e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{m}\right\}$, respectively, where the properties may overlap. We then derive formulas for the intensional inheritance using both Shannon information theory and algorithmic information theory, incorporating interaction information among properties. We examine a special case where all properties are mutually exclusive and calculate the intensional inheritance in this case in both frameworks. We also derive expressions for $P(W \mid F)$ based on the mutual information formula. Finally we consider the relationship between intensional inheritance and conventional set-theoretic "extensional" inheritance, concluding that in our information-theoretic framework, extensional inheritance emerges as a special case of intensional inheritance.</description>

      <title>Winning Rates of $(n,k)$ Quantum Coset Monogamy Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game, in which two players must extract complementary information of unequal size ($k$ bits vs. $n-k$ bits) from a random coset state without communicating. The complementary information takes the form of random Pauli-X and Pauli-Z errors on subspace states. Our game generalizes those considered in previous works that deal with the case of equal information size $(k=\frac{n}{2})$. We prove a convex upper bound of the information-theoretic winning rate of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game in terms of the subspace rate $R=\frac{k}{n}\in [0,1]$. This bound improves upon previous results for the case of $R=\frac{1}{2}$. We also prove the achievability of an optimal winning probability upper bound for the class of unentangled strategies of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game.</description>

      <title>Predictive Beamforming with Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, roadside units (RSUs) can be tasked with both sensing and communication functions to enable sensing-assisted communications. Recent studies have demonstrated that distance, angle, and velocity information obtained through sensing can be leveraged to reduce the overhead associated with communication beam tracking. In this work, we extend this concept to scenarios involving multiple distributed RSUs and distributed MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems. We derive the state evolution model, formulate the extended Kalman-filter equations, and implement predictive beamforming for distributed MIMO. Simulation results indicate that, when compared with a co-located massive MIMO antenna array, distributed antennas lead to more uniform and robust sensing performance, coverage, and data rates, while the vehicular user is in motion.</description>

      <title>Wideband Beamforming for RIS Assisted Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A near-field wideband beamforming scheme is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which a deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) optimization framework is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency. To deal with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy consumption and hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Bayesian Estimation of Fixed Channel States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies an information-theoretic performance limit of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where the goal of sensing is to estimate a random continuous state. Considering the mean-squared error (MSE) for estimation performance metric, the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (BCRB) is widely used in literature as a proxy of the MSE; however, the BCRB is not generally tight even asymptotically except for restrictive distributions. Instead, we characterize the full tradeoff between information rate and the exact MSE using the asymptotically tight BCRB (ATBCRB) analysis, a recent variant of the BCRB. Our characterization is applicable for general channels as long as the regularity conditions are met, and the proof relies on constant composition codes and ATBCRB analysis with the codes. We also perform a numerical evaluation of the tradeoff in a variance estimation example, which commonly arises in spectrum sensing scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Unified Representation of Density-Power-Based Divergences Reducible to M-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density-power-based divergences are known to provide robust inference procedures against outliers, and their extensions have been widely studied. A characteristic of successful divergences is that the estimation problem can be reduced to M-estimation. In this paper, we define a norm-based Bregman density power divergence (NB-DPD) -- density-power-based divergence with functional flexibility within the framework of Bregman divergences that can be reduced to M-estimation. We show that, by specifying the function $\phi_\gamma$, NB-DPD reduces to well-known divergences, such as the density power divergence and the $\gamma$-divergence. Furthermore, by examining the combinations of functions $\phi_\gamma$ corresponding to existing divergences, we show that a new divergence connecting these existing divergences can be derived. Finally, we show that the redescending property, one of the key indicators of robustness, holds only for the $\gamma$-divergence.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new asymptotic equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a "typical set" that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We show that this typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct outputs. These results suggest possible applications to important practical problems such as (a) detecting synthetic AI-generated text, and (b) testing whether a text was used to train a language model. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations.</description>

      <title>DRACO: Decentralized Asynchronous Federated Learning over Row-Stochastic Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments and emerging use cases, such as smart Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge AI, have sparked considerable interest in the training of neural networks over fully decentralized (serverless) networks. One of the major challenges of decentralized learning is to ensure stable convergence without resorting to strong assumptions applied for each agent regarding data distributions or updating policies. To address these issues, we propose DRACO, a novel method for decentralized asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over row-stochastic gossip wireless networks by leveraging continuous communication. Our approach enables edge devices within decentralized networks to perform local training and model exchanging along a continuous timeline, thereby eliminating the necessity for synchronized timing. The algorithm also features a specific technique of decoupling communication and computation schedules, which empowers complete autonomy for all users and manageable instructions for stragglers. Through a comprehensive convergence analysis, we highlight the advantages of asynchronous and autonomous participation in decentralized optimization. Our numerical experiments corroborate the efficacy of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Refining Concentration for Gaussian Quadratic Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We visit and slightly modify the proof of Hanson-Wright inequality (HW inequality) for concentration of Gaussian quadratic chaos where we are able to tighten the bound by increasing the absolute constant in its formulation from its largest currently known value of 0.125 to at least 0.145 in the symmetric case. We also present a sharper version of the so-called Laurent-Massart inequality (LM inequality) through which we are able to increase the absolute constant in HW inequality from its largest currently available value of $0.134$ due to LM~inequality itself to at least $0.152$ in the positive-semidefinite case. Generalizing HW inequality in the symmetric case, we derive a sequence of concentration bounds for Gaussian quadratic chaos indexed over $m=1,2,3,\cdots$ that involves the Schatten norms of the underlying matrix. The case $m=1$ reduces to HW inequality. These bounds exhibit a phase transition in behaviour in the sense that $m=1$ results in the tightest bound if the deviation is smaller than a critical threshold and the bounds keep getting tighter as the index $m$ increases when the deviation is larger than the aforementioned threshold. Finally, we derive a concentration bound that is asymptotically tighter than HW inequality both in the small and large deviation regimes. Finally, we explore concentration bounds when the underlying matrix is positive-semidefinite and only the dimension~$n$ and its operator norm (largest eigenvalue) are known. Four candidates are examined, namely, the $m_\infty$-bound, relaxed versions of HW and LM bounds and a bound that we refer to as the $\chi^2$-bound.</description>

      <title>Tight Sample Complexity Bounds for Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy for Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short note provides tight upper and lower bounds for minimal number of samples (copies of quantum states) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under differential privacy. The lower bound loosens (converges to zero) in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$, but that case is not particularly interesting as tight bounds for parameter estimation in the noiseless case are widely known. That being said, extensions to systems with higher dimensions and tightening the bounds for the large privacy budget regime are interesting avenues for future research.</description>
