      <title>The extended molecular gas of the Circinus galaxy and NGC 1097 as seen by APEX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outer region of the interstellar medium (ISM) is witness to dynamically important events in a galaxy's evolutionary history such as outflows, inflows, tidal interactions, and mergers, as well as dynamical structures affecting its current evolution such as bars and spiral arms. Studying imprints of these processes in the diffuse, extended molecular gas is best achieved by a single dish telescope which can cover a large field of view with good sensitivity to large-scale structures. In this work we present results from APEX line emission maps of two nearby galaxies: the Circinus galaxy in the CO(3-2) transition, and NGC 1097 in CO(2-1), covering their full optical extents. We detect gas at the largest extents seen for these galaxies yet, at 5$^{\prime}$ ($r \approx 6$ kpc) for the Circinus galaxy, and $4^{\prime}.5$ ($r \approx 18$ kpc) for NGC 1097, and compute total CO luminosities of $L^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO(3-2)}} = (1.5\pm0.4)\times10^{8}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$ and $L^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO(2-1)}} = (7.0\pm1.7)\times10^{8}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$, corresponding to molecular gas masses of $(2.1\pm1.0)\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $(4.7\pm1.9)\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively. We further analyze the large-scale gas kinematics via PV diagrams and tilted ring modeling using $^{\mathrm{3D}}$BAROLO. We detect notable features in both galaxies beyond the well-studied central regions: in the Circinus galaxy we detect molecular gas embedded in a bar-like structure, whose kinematic signature is also evident in the major axis PV diagram, and in NGC 1097, we observe tidal molecular gas involved in the interaction of NGC 1097 with the companion galaxy NGC 1097A. The clear detection of such molecular gas structures shows promise in conducting large-scale molecular gas studies toward nearby galaxies with APEX and, in the future, the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST).</description>

      <title>Population III star formation near high-redshift active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.</description>

      <title>A massive, evolved slow-rotating galaxy in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's Universe, most galaxies are rotationally supported against gravity. However, a small fraction of the most massive galaxies which are no longer forming stars (i.e., they are quiescent) are dispersion supported, and are termed 'slow-rotators.' These galaxies, which are highly evolved and often exist in dense cluster environments, are theorized to be formed by a history of merger activity that on average decreases the angular momentum of the merged system and disturbs any disk structure. At high redshift, such extreme slow-rotating systems are predicted to be far less common. While observations of massive high-redshift galaxies which enable kinematic studies are challenging to obtain, all previous data have revealed systems that are rotating rapidly. No slow-rotators have been confirmed from stellar kinematics beyond z~2. In this work we present results from James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of XMM-VID1-2075, a massive, quiescent galaxy at z=3.449 with a morphology exhibiting clear low-surface brightness asymmetries and with a measured spin parameter of $\lambda _{R_e} = 0.101 \pm 0.018$, consistent with the lack of rotation seen in slow rotators in the local Universe. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that merger activity played a key role in the formation and kinematic transformation of some of the most massive galaxies when the Universe was &lt;2 Gyr old, much earlier than previously observed.</description>

      <title>An Ultraviolet Study of CO Chemistry in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does molecular cloud chemistry change with metallicity? In this work, we study the relation between molecular hydrogen ($H_2$) and carbon monoxide (CO) at $1/2$ and $1/5$ solar metallicity using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy obtained as part of the UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program. We determine CO column densities or upper limits for a sample of 50 lines of sight through the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). $^{12}$CO is detected along eight lines of sight and $^{13}$CO is detected along two. Combining our new CO column densities with $N_{H_2}$ measurements from the literature, we find that the evolution of $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ from the Milky Way to the LMC and SMC is a relatively shallow function of metallicity. Taking $N_{CO}&gt;3\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ as a threshold value above which CO emission is likely to be detectable at the distance of the Magellanic Clouds, the $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ at which a sightline has a 50% probability of having $N_{CO}$ above this threshold is 20.8 in the Milky Way, 20.9 in the LMC, and 21.1 in the SMC. This is an 0.3 dex change in threshold $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ over an 0.7 dex change in metallicity. We compare our measurements with $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ relations from literature chemical models and find that the measured relations agree best with models in which the dynamical timescale is longer than the chemical timescale for $H_2$ but shorter than the chemical timescale for CO.</description>

      <title>$r$-process Abundance Dispersion in the Globular Cluster M5 using Keck Archival Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied $28$ RGB stars in the mildly metal-rich globular cluster M5 ([Fe/H] $= -1.29$) using archival high-resolution spectra from the Keck Observatory archive (KOA) to better understand the $r$-process in globular clusters. Previous studies (M15, M92, and NGC 2298) have shown $r$-process dispersion in varying amounts, hinting at the source of the $r$-process in those clusters. We extend these dispersion studies to the more metal-rich cluster M5 by studying the rare-earth peak, specifically the elements Ba, Nd, and Eu. We separately analyze the different stellar generations, as traced by the abundance of Na and O. Based on the Nd and Eu abundances, we report a tenuous detection of $r$-process dispersion that is dependent on the generation and element. Based on a log-likelihood dispersion study accounting for measurement errors, Nd has an intrinsic first generation abundance spread of $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Nd}) = 0.15_{-0.07}^{+0.10}$ and an $2\sigma$ upper limit on the second generation spread of $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Nd}) &lt; 0.28$. The upper limits on the Eu intrinsic spread are $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Eu}) &lt; 0.34$ and $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Eu}) &lt; 0.16$. A potential dispersion implies the cluster gas was inhomogeneously polluted, either due to an event concurrent with the formation of the cluster or due to clouds of disparate composition that coalesced to form the cluster.</description>

      <title>Not-so-heavy metal(s): Chemical Abundances in the Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxies Eridanus IV and Centaurus I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detailed chemical abundances of the brightest star in each of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies Eridanus IV and Centaurus I using high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. The brightest star in Centaurus I, CenI-5136, is a very metal-poor star with metallicity [Fe/H] = $-2.52\pm0.17$ and chemical abundances typical of a star in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. We confirm that the star in Eridanus IV, EriIV-9808, is extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] = $-3.25\pm0.19$) and find that it is carbon-enhanced, with [C/Fe] = $1.07\pm0.34$, as is common for many stars at this metallicity. Both stars are also neutron-capture deficient, which is typical of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, but less common in other environments. We consider possible enrichment scenarios for EriIV-9808 and tentatively conclude that it is unlikely to be the descendant of a single Pop III progenitor, despite its carbon-enhancement and low metallicity.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRCam Imaging of NGC 4258: I. Observation Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of the nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258, which hosts strong star formation regions as well as an anomalous jet-like radio structure that extends through a significant portion of its disk. This galaxy provides a unique environment to study Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven shocks and their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM) as its proximity allows for narrow-band observations of various near-infrared tracers sensitive to multiple levels of shock and radiative excitation: [Fe II] (1.64 $\mu$m), Pa$\alpha$ (1.87 $\mu$m), H$_2$ (2.21 $\mu$m), 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, Br$\alpha$ (4.05 $\mu$m), and Pf$\beta$ (4.66 $\mu$m), allowing us to trace shocks with parsec-scale resolution. Comparing these near-infrared observations with available ultraviolet, optical, radio, and X-ray imaging, we find that shocks present in the brightest regions of the anomalous radio structure are likely of low-velocity (50-100 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting that these features originate from AGN-driven winds that interact with the host medium and mechanically impart energy into the disk. Further, while co-spatial [Fe II] and H$_2$ emission indicate multi-phase shocks, PAH emission is relatively weaker or absent in the most shock-excited regions, consistent with the destruction of small dust grains. Finally, we propose that surveys identifying enhanced [Fe II] in AGN host galaxies may systematically reveal a key population where AGN feedback is significantly coupled with the surrounding ISM and actively shaping galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>SQ-A: A Collision Triggered Starburst in Intra-Group Medium of Stephan's Quintet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b (v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between 0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9". The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600 km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas accompanied by blast-wave shocks.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Observations of PAH Emission and Evolution in H II Regions of NGC 5457</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: To investigate the physical processing of PAHs in high-mass star-forming environments. This study aims to characterize how the PAH ionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for spectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field spectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the prominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key diagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population. Results: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in their PAH spectral characteristics. The diagnostic F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratio, a tracer of PAH ionization, varies from 0.23 to 0.62 across the sample. The region with the highest ionization (highest F(8.6)/F(11.3)) shows the lowest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (1.13), while the region with the lowest ionization has the highest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (2.38). Conclusion: The observed spectral diversity is primarily driven by variations in the PAH ionization state, which is governed by the local radiation field intensity. The strong anti-correlation between the F(7.7)/F(8.6) and F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratios provides a new, powerful diagnostic for PAH processing. This trend is interpreted as an evolutionary sequence where increasingly harsh radiation fields not only ionize the PAH population but also alter the surviving cations, consistent with the selective destruction of the carriers of the 7.7 micron feature.</description>

      <title>Four binary microlenses with directly measured masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated binary lens events from the 2022-2024 microlensing surveys, aiming to identify events suitable for lens mass measurements. We focused on two key light curve features: distinct caustic spikes with resolved crossings for measuring the angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}$), and long durations enabling microlens-parallax ($\pi_{\rm E}$) measurements. Four events met these criteria: KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309. We estimated the angular Einstein radius by combining the normalized source radius measured from modeling the resolved caustic spikes with the angular source radius derived from the source color and magnitude. Additionally, we determined the microlens parallax through light curve modeling, considering higher-order effects caused by the orbital motions of Earth and the binary lens. With measurements of the event timescale, angular Einstein radius, and microlens parallax, we uniquely determined the mass and distance of the lens. For the events KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309, both components of the binary lens have masses lower than that of the Sun, consistent with M-type dwarfs, which are the most common type of lenses in Galactic microlensing events. These lenses are relatively nearby, with distances $\lesssim 2.5$ kpc, indicating their location within the Galactic disk. In contrast, for OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, the primary lens component has a mass similar to that of the Sun, while the companion lens component has about half the mass of the primary. This lens system is situated at a greater distance, roughly 4.5 kpc.</description>

      <title>The NHIM development scenario in an asymmetric binary system of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the development scenario of a three-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system.We observe how the fundamental normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) form a homoclinic/heteroclinic tangle. As the energy increases, the NHIMs begin to lose normal hyperbolicity and decay, creating tangential transient effects. We also observe a certain kind of coordination between the development scenarios of these NHIMs. We analyse this phenomenon using Poincar\'e maps and phase space indicator functions. As an example of demonstration, we use a relatively simple model of a test particle moving in the gravitational field of a pair of interacting dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>NGC 2392 and NGC 4361: Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Planetary Nebula Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC~2392 and NGC~4361 using optical spectra obtained from the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and mid-infrared spectra from archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS data. The physical conditions, such as electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$), were derived using diagnostic emission lines through the PyNeb software. Elemental abundances of key species, including He, O, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, were determined for both nebulae, offering insights into their nucleosynthesis history and evolutionary status. High-resolution HST and Pan-STARRS imaging further elucidate the morphological structures of the nebulae. NGC~2392 exhibits a well-defined double-shell structure and moderate excitation characteristics, while NGC~4361 displays a diffuse elliptical morphology with high-excitation conditions and a notably low nitrogen content. The observed line spectra and derived abundances point toward distinct progenitor histories for the two PNe, with NGC~2392 originating from a younger, intermediate-mass progenitor, while NGC~4361 traces an older, metal-poor Population II star. This comparative study enhances our understanding of the evolution and chemical enrichment processes of low- to intermediate-mass stars.</description>

      <title>SN 2021aaev: a Hydrogen-Rich Superluminous Supernova with Early Flash and Long-Lived Circumstellar Interaction in an Unusual Host Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN\,2021aaev, a hydrogen-rich, superluminous supernova with persistent (at least $\sim100$ days) narrow Balmer lines (SLSN-IIn) at redshift $z=0.1557$. We observed SN\,2021aaev to rise in $32.5 \pm 1.0$ days since first light and reach a peak absolute magnitude of $-21.46 \pm 0.01$ in the ATLAS $o$ band. The pre-peak spectra resemble those of typical SNe IIn with flash-ionization features arising from the interaction with a dense, confined circumstellar medium (CSM), albeit the flash timescale is longer than usual ($&gt;20$ days). Post peak, the narrow emission lines evolve slowly, and the absence of ejecta features indicates strong deceleration by the CSM. The total radiated energy (about $1.41\times10^{51}$~ergs) is possible with a low-mass (1--$2\,M_{\odot}$) ejecta ploughing into a massive (9--$19\,M_{\odot}$), extended (outer radius $&gt;1\times10^{16}$~cm) H-rich CSM, or alternatively, with magnetar-powered models. Interestingly, the host environment consists of a spiral galaxy with a red substructure in the south-eastern part, and the SN's exact location coincided with the quiescent red substructure (star-formation rate$=0.02^{+0.13}_{-0.02}\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$). Given the atypical environment and the obscuring effect of the massive CSM, a thermonuclear (Type Ia-CSM) origin cannot be ruled out. Altogether, SN\,2021aaev is a compelling case to study the diversity of SLSN-IIn features and their host environment.</description>

      <title>The dynamical impact of cosmic rays in the Rhea magnetohydrodynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) in Milky Way-like galaxies using the Rhea simulation suite. Cosmic rays, with their substantial energy density, influence the interstellar medium (ISM) by supporting galactic winds, modulating star formation, and shaping ISM energetics. The simulations incorporate a multi-phase ISM, self-consistent CR transport in the advection-diffusion approximation, and interactions with magnetic fields to study their effect on galaxy evolution. Key findings reveal that CRs reduce star formation rates, and drive weak but sustained outflows with mass loading factors of $\sim0.2$, transporting a substantial fraction (20%-60%) of the injected CR energy. These CR-driven outflows are launched not just from the galactic center but across the entire disk, illustrating their pervasive dynamical influence. Galactic disks supported by CRs exhibit broader vertical structures compared to magnetic-field-dominated setups, though the scale heights are similar. CR feedback enhances magnetic flux transport to the circumgalactic medium (CGM), leading to a magnetically enriched CGM with field strengths of $\sim0.5\mu\mathrm{G}$ while reducing gas temperatures to $\lesssim10^5\,\mathrm{K}$. The CR energy is relatively smoothly distributed in the disk, with gradient lengths exceeding the typical size of molecular clouds, indicating that the CR behavior is not adiabatic.</description>

      <title>Testing a New Star Formation History Model from Principal Component Analysis to Facilitate Spectral Synthesis Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of a galaxy is a complicated convolution of many properties of the galaxy, such as the star formation history (SFH), initial mass function, and metallicity. Inferring galaxy properties from the observed spectrum via spectral synthesis modeling is thus challenging. In particular, a simple yet flexible model for the SFH is required to obtain unbiased inferences. In this paper, we use SFHs from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations to test SFH models in terms of their capability of describing the simulated SFHs and the spectra generated from them. In addition to some commonly used SFH models ($\Gamma$, $\tau$, and nonparametric), we also examine a model developed from principal component analysis (PCA), trained by a set of SFHs from IllustrisTNG. We find that when using the first five principal components (eigenhistories), the PCA-based models can achieve a good balance between simplicity and accuracy. Among the models tested, the PCA-based model provides high flexibility, by capturing diverse and complex simulated SFHs. To accurately reproduce spectra generated from the simulated SFHs, it is necessary to have a degree of freedom to describe the most recent SFH (e.g., a step function covering the age of 0 - 0.3 Gyr). Overall, the PCA+step model performs well in capturing the diversity of SFHs and reproducing the associated spectra, suggesting it is a promising and reliable approach for spectral synthesis modeling.</description>

      <title>EDGE: The emergence of dwarf galaxy scaling relations from cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new suite of EDGE (`Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge') cosmological zoom simulations. The suite includes 15 radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxies covering the ultra-faint to the dwarf irregular regime ($10^4 \leq M_{\star}(z=0) \leq 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$) to enable comparisons with observed scaling relations. Each object in the suite is evolved at high resolution ($\approx 3 \, \text{pc}$) and includes stellar radiation, winds and supernova feedback channels. We compare with previous \textsc{edge} simulations without radiation, finding that radiative feedback results in significantly weaker galactic outflows. This generalizes our previous findings to a wide mass range, and reveals that the effect is most significant at low $M_{\star}$. Despite this difference, stellar masses stay within a factor of two of each other, and key scaling relations of dwarf galaxies (size-mass, neutral gas-stellar mass, gas-phase mass-metallicity) emerge correctly in both simulation suites. Only the stellar mass -- stellar metallicity relation is strongly sensitive to the change in feedback. This highlights how obtaining statistical samples of dwarf galaxy stellar abundances with next-generation spectrographs will be key to probing and constraining the baryon cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>What drives the growth of black holes: a decade of progress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs). It is now clear that an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN: the observed manifestation of a growing SMBH) is an "event" within the broader lifecycle of a galaxy, which can significantly influence the shape and evolution of the galaxy itself. Our view of the obscuring medium that affects the observed properties of an AGN has also undergone a revolution, and we now have a more physical understanding of the connection between the fuelling of (and feedback from) the SMBH and the broader host-galaxy and larger-scale environment. We have a greater understanding of the physics of SMBH accretion, can identify AGNs out to z = 8-10 witnessing the very earliest phases of SMBH growth, and have a more complete census of AGN activity than ever before. This great progress has been enabled by new innovative facilities, an ever-increasing quantity of multi-wavelength data, the exploitation and development of new techniques, and greater community-wide engagement. In this article we review our understanding of AGNs and the growth of SMBHs, providing an update of the earlier Alexander and Hickox (2012) review. Using citation-network analyses we also show where this review fits within the broader black-hole research literature and, adopting the previous article as a snapshot of the field over a decade ago, identify the drivers that have enabled the greatest scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origins of Galactic Globular Clusters via Their Mg-Al Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many Galactic globular clusters (GCs) originated in diverse host galaxies before being subsequently incorporated into the Milky Way through hierarchical galaxy assembly. Identifying their origins is crucial for revealing galaxy properties at early times. Traditional classification methods relying on dynamical properties face inherent uncertainties stemming from the evolving Galactic potential and complex merger histories. Chemically driven classification confronts a distinct obstacle: multiple populations - abundance variations in light elements of GC members. In this Letter, we identify primordial populations exhibiting lower [Al/Fe] as reliable tracers of their birth environments' chemical evolution. A clear chemical dichotomy emerges between in-situ and accreted GC populations at [Fe/H] &gt; -1.5, particularly in the [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] plane, indicating that their progenitor galaxies have experienced fundamentally different enrichment histories. While our chemically driven classification demonstrates general consistency with dynamically driven classifications, notable discrepancies emerge: NGC 288 and M4 are reclassified as in-situ, and Terzan 9 as accreted. This chemically driven GC classification provides promising application for Galactic archaeology.</description>

      <title>Shadows of generalised Hayward spacetimes : in vacuum and with plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties of a wide class of spacetimes arising from different parameter regimes of the generalized Hayward metric, characterized by two independent parameters $(\sigma, \kappa)$ (Phys. Rev. D 106, 044028). This metric extends the original Hayward regular black hole solution by introducing distinct mass functions in the $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components, giving rise to four types of wormholes ( which include multi-peak effective potentials), a regular black hole, and a singular black hole solutions allowing for a unified treatment of black hole mimickers. We compute the shadow radii for all spacetimes in vacuum and in the presence of plasma, using both homogeneous and non-homogeneous plasma profiles. Our results show that certain wormhole solutions particularly the Hayward-Damour-Solodukhin class can exhibit multiple photon spheres, leading to shadow features that differ significantly from the Schwarzschild black hole. When these results are compared with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr~$A^\star$, we find that regular black holes remain observationally viable but only within a narrow parameter space. In contrast, wormhole solutions with multi-peak effective potentials are more consistent with shadow constraints than those with single peaks. This contrasts with quasinormal mode studies, which favored single-barrier potentials, and may imply detectable late-time echoes in gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>A new way to find symbiotic stars: accretion disc detection with continuum survey photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binaries in which a cool and evolved star of luminosity class I-III accretes onto a smaller companion. However, direct accretion signatures like disc flickering and boundary layer X-rays are typically outshone or suppressed by the luminous giant, shell burning on the accreting white dwarf, and the illuminated wind nebula. We present a new way to find symbiotics that is less biased against directly-detectable accretion discs than methods based on narrow-band H$\alpha$ photometry or objective prism plate surveys. We identified outliers in SkyMapper survey photometry, using reconstructed uvg snapshot colours and rapid variability among the three exposures of each 20-minute SkyMapper Main Survey filter sequence, from a sample of 366,721 luminous red objects. We found that SkyMapper catalog colours of large-amplitude pulsating giants must be corrected for variability, and that flickering is detectable with only three data points. Our methods probed a different region of parameter space than a recent search for accreting-only symbiotics in the GALAH survey, while being surprisingly concordant with another survey's infrared detection algorithm. We discovered 12 new symbiotics, including four with optical accretion disc flickering. Two of the optical flickerers exhibited boundary-layer hard X-rays. We also identified 10 symbiotic candidates, and discovered likely optical flickering in the known symbiotic V1044 Cen (CD-36 8436). We conclude that at least 20% of the true population of symbiotics exhibit detectable optical flickering from the inner accretion disc, the majority of which do not meet the H$\alpha$ detection thresholds used to find symbiotics in typical narrow-band surveys.</description>
