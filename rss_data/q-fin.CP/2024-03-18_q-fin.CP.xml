      <title>A path-dependent PDE solver based on signature kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a provably convergent kernel-based solver for path-dependent PDEs (PPDEs). Our numerical scheme leverages signature kernels, a recently introduced class of kernels on path-space. Specifically, we solve an optimal recovery problem by approximating the solution of a PPDE with an element of minimal norm in the signature reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) constrained to satisfy the PPDE at a finite collection of collocation paths. In the linear case, we show that the optimisation has a unique closed-form solution expressed in terms of signature kernel evaluations at the collocation paths. We prove consistency of the proposed scheme, guaranteeing convergence to the PPDE solution as the number of collocation points increases. Finally, several numerical examples are presented, in particular in the context of option pricing under rough volatility. Our numerical scheme constitutes a valid alternative to the ubiquitous Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Dynamics and Order Size Modelling Using Compound Hawkes Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange and compare them against several baselines. Finally, we conduct a market impact study of the simulator and show the empirical observation of a concave market impact function is indeed replicated.</description>

      <title>Stochastic expansion for the pricing of Asian and basket options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present closed analytical approximations for the pricing of basket options, also applicable to Asian options with discrete averaging under the Black-Scholes model with time-dependent parameters. The formulae are obtained by using a stochastic Taylor expansion around a log-normal proxy model and are found to be highly accurate for Asian options in practice as well as for vanilla options with discrete dividends.</description>
