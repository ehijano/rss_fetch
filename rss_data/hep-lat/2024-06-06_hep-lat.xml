      <title>Stout smearing and Wilson flow in lattice perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the expansion of stout smearing and the Wilson flow in lattice perturbation theory to order $g_0^3$, which is suitable for one-loop calculations. As the Wilson flow is generated by infinitesimal stout smearing steps, the results are related to each other by taking the appropriate limits. We show how to apply perturbative stout smearing or Wilson flow to the Feynman rules of any lattice fermion action and and illustrate them by calculating the self-energy of the clover-improved Wilson fermion.</description>

      <title>Nucleon form factors in $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at the physical point : finite lattice spacing effect on the root-mean-square radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for the nucleon form factors: electric ($G_E$), magnetic ($G_M$), axial ($F_A$), induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) and pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors, using the second PACS10 ensemble that is one of three sets of $2+1$ flavor lattice QCD configurations at physical quark masses in large spatial volumes (exceeding $(10\ \mathrm{fm})^3$). The second PACS10 gauge configurations are generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at the second gauge coupling $\beta=2.00$ corresponding to the lattice spacing of $a=0.063$ fm. We determine the isovector electric, magnetic and axial radii and magnetic moment from the corresponding form factors, as well as the axial-vector coupling $g_A$. Combining our previous results for the coarser lattice spacing [E. Shintani et al., Phys. Rev. D99 (2019) 014510; Phys. Rev. D102 (2020) 019902 (erattum)], the finite lattice spacing effects on the isovector radii, magnetic moment and axial-vector coupling are investigated using the difference between the two results. It was found that the effect on $g_A$ is kept smaller than the statistical error of 2% while the effect on the isovector radii was observed as a possible discretization error of about 10%, regardless of the channel. We also report the partially conserved axial vector current (PCAC) relation using a set of nucleon three-point correlation functions in order to verify the effect by $O(a)$-improvement of the axial-vector current.</description>

      <title>Path integrals, complex probabilities and the discrete Weyl representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.12494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete formulation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a functional of paths with respect to a complex probability on a sample space of discrete valued paths is explored. The formulation in terms of complex probabilities is motivated by a recent reinterpretation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a potential functional with respect to a complex probability distribution on cylinder sets of paths. The discrete formulation in this work is based on a discrete version of Weyl algebra that can be applied to any observable with a finite number of outcomes. The origin of the complex probability in this work is the completeness relation. In the discrete formulation the complex probability exactly factors into products of conditional probabilities and exact unitarity is maintained at each level of approximation. The approximation of infinite dimensional quantum systems by discrete systems is discussed. Applications to scattering theory and quantum field theory are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Understanding the nature of the $\Delta(1600)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a coupled-channel analysis of the $ J^P = 3/2^+ \Delta $-baryon spectrum, based in the framework of Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We construct a Hamiltonian which mixes quark model-like single-particle states and two-particle meson-baryon channels, and constrain this via experimentally measured $ \pi N \to \pi N $ scattering observables. In the same vein as L\"{u}scher's approach, we then connect this infinite-volume inspired Hamiltonian with finite-volume lattice QCD results. Drawing on lattice correlation-matrix eigenvectors identifying the $ 1s $ and $ 2s $ states in the finite-volume $ \Delta(3/2^+) $ spectrum, and utilising the HEFT eigenvectors describing the composition of the energy eigenstates, we resolve the structure of these states and their relation to the $ \Delta(1600) $ resonance. We find the dominant contributions to this resonance come from strong rescattering in the $ \pi N $ and $ \pi \Delta $ channels. This contrasts the long-held view of a dominant quark model-like core for the $ \Delta(1600) $. Further discussion of other contemporary lattice results for the $ \Delta $ spectrum and $ \pi N $ scattering states is also presented.</description>
