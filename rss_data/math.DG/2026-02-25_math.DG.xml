      <title>On Weighted Twisted K-Energy and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the convexity of the weighted twisted Mabuchi K-energy functional along geodesics in the finite energy space $\mathcal{E}^{1,T}(X,\omega)$, covering the case of divisors with mixed cusp and conic singularities. We then prove that coercivity (relative to the complex torus) of this functional is an open condition under cone angle perturbations. This is obtained from a general result of independent interest, which shows the stability of the coercivity under perturbations by certain twist currents. In particular, this yields the openness for the existence for cscK cone metrics and proves that coercivity at the cusp limit implies existence of cscK cone metrics for small cone angles.</description>

      <title>Morita equivalence of Nijenhuis structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Morita equivalence for Nijenhuis groupoids and for their infinitesimal counterparts, establishing a global-to-infinitesimal correspondence under the Lie functor. A special case is that of holomorphic Lie groupoids and algebroids. We use our framework to enhance the known Morita equivalences for quasi-symplectic groupoids and Dirac structures with compatible Nijenhuis structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Hultgren's polytope formulation of the existence of coupled K\"ahler-Einstein (cKE) metrics on toric Fano manifolds, we construct explicit higher-dimensional toric Fano manifolds that admit two coupled K\"ahler-Einstein metrics but no ordinary K\"ahler-Einstein metrics. In particular, we exhibit such examples among certain projective bundles over products of projective spaces. Motivated by these constructions, we conjecture that examples of this type exist in all dimensions $n\geq 4$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if an n-dimensional geodesically complete CAT(0) space has Tits boundary sufficiently close to the (n-1)-dimensional standard unit sphere, then it is bi-Lipschiz homeomorphic to the n-dimensional Euclidean space. As an application, we conclude that if an (n-1)-dimensional geodesically complete CAT(1) space is sufficiently close to the (n-1)-dimensional standard unit sphere, then they are bi-Lipschiz homeomorphic to each other.</description>

      <title>Optimal inequalities involving Casorati curvatures along Riemannian maps and Riemannian submersions for quaternionic space form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Casorati inequalities for Riemannian maps and Riemannian submersions involving quaternionic space forms, and we provide geometric characterisations of their equality cases. First, we derive Casorati inequalities for Riemannian maps to quaternionic space forms and describe the corresponding equality cases, showing that the leaves of the range space are invariantly quasi-umbilical, and that the associated shape operator matrix commutes. Next, we obtain Casorati inequalities involving the fundamental tensor fields $T$ and $A$ for Riemannian submersions from quaternionic space forms onto Riemannian manifolds, together with their geometric interpretations. In particular, we prove that the equality case corresponding to the tensor field $A$ along the horizontal distribution is equivalent to the integrability of the horizontal distribution. Moreover, the equality case associated with the tensor field $T$ along the vertical distribution characterises fibres that are invariantly quasi-umbilical with a commuting shape operator matrix. Finally, the simultaneous equality cases involving both tensor fields $T$ and $A$ along the horizontal and vertical distributions imply the integrability of the horizontal distribution together with the invariantly quasi-umbilical nature of the fibres and the commutativity of the corresponding shape operators.</description>

      <title>A flow approach to the Toda system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a flow to study the Toda system, which we call {\it Toda flow.} More generally, we introduce a flow of the Liouville systems, formulated as a coupled parabolic system with nonlocal interactions. Finite-time singularities are characterized and both necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence are provided in this general setting, even when the prescribed functions are allowed to change sign.
  As an application, we prove a global existence for the Toda flow in the critical case without restricting the sign of the prescribed functions. We provide a detailed description of blow-up behavior at infinity and obtain a sharp lower bound for the functional in cases where global convergence fails. By constructing appropriate test functions, we further establish a sufficient condition for the global convergence of the flow. These results are not affected by the sign-changing nature of the prescribed functions, and extend the theorem of Jost, Lin and Wang (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 59, 526-558, 2006) to systems of multiple equations under this more general and physically relevant condition.</description>

      <title>High Codimension Curve Shortening Flow with Free Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study curve shortening flow in high codimension for arcs with free boundary meeting a fixed smooth barrier orthogonally. We prove dilation-invariant curvature and higher-derivative estimates up to the boundary using a Stahl-type localised maximum principle and an adapted cut-off. Using a reflected Gaussian entropy and blow-up analysis, Type I boundary singularities yield a shrinking semicircle model after reflection. Type II blow-ups give a Grim Reaper translator, which is ruled out under a free-boundary entropy bound $&lt;2$. Hence in the low-entropy regime the flow either converges to the orthogonal chord or has only semicircle boundary singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop minimal slicing via capillary hypersurfaces to understand positive scalar curvature metric on manifolds with boundary. The method provides rigidity statements once the regularity of minimizers of capillary area functional holds. In particular, in dimension $4$, we prove following comparison and rigidity statement: given a compact Riemannian $4$-manifold $(M^4,g)$ with a mean convex boundary whose boundary is diffeomorphic to boundary of a connected convex domain in $\mathbb R^4$, if the scalar curvature is non-negative and the scaled mean curvature comparison holds along the boundary, then $M$ is isometric to the Euclidean domain.</description>

      <title>Integral Inequalities and Rigidity for $V$-Static-Type Equations on Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary satisfying V-static-type equations. By combining a generalized Reilly formula with Steklov-type boundary value problems, we derive integral inequalities for geometric quantities associated with the boundary. These inequalities lead to rigidity results, including characterizations of geodesic balls in space forms. In particular, our results offer new insights into several known rigidity theorems in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the link between the theory of sheaves on graphs and noncommutative geometry showing that many concepts and constructions in the latter can be generalized and enhanced using methods coming from the former. They include notions such as Laplacians and connections, important in the theory of discrete noncommutative geometry, that are here explored with sheaf theoretic methods and using the language of (semi)simplicial sets.</description>

      <title>Magnetic equations on the Heisenberg group: symmetries, solutions and the inverse problem of the calculus of variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heisenberg Lie group $H_3$ is modeled on the differentiable structure of $\mathbb{R}^3$ but equipped with another non-commutative product operation. By fixing the usual metric on the Heisenberg Lie group, this work provides a comprehensive overview of the behavior of magnetic geodesics for any invariant Lorentz force. After writing the magnetic equations, we found symmetries that enable the explicit computation of the magnetic trajectories for any homogeneous exact and non-exact magnetic form. Finally we show that these magnetic trajectories are solutions of a variational problem: we present explicit examples of Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Universal Functions for Topological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider correlation functions of topologically twisted, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group ${\rm SU}(2)$ and $N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. For a smooth, compact, oriented four-manifold $X$ with $b_2^+&gt;1$, the correlation functions are expressed in terms of a finite set of universal functions. The mass dependence of these functions encodes intersection numbers of the moduli space of instantons. We determine closed expressions for the universal functions by combining techniques of the Seiberg-Witten geometry, $u$-plane integral and the blowup formula. If $X$ is specialised to a complex algebraic surface $S$, the correlation functions can be identified with generating functions of Segre invariants for moduli spaces of sheaves on $S$. We verify that our results agree with the results by G\"ottsche and Kool for these generating functions.</description>

      <title>$C^0$-Poisson geometry, coisotropic submanifolds, and clean intersection points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of rigidity and non-rigidity phenomena for Poisson homeomorphisms, defined as uniform $C^0$-limits of Poisson diffeomorphisms. First, we prove that Poisson homeomorphisms preserve the singular symplectic foliation: they map symplectic leaves to symplectic leaves by symplectic homeomorphisms. Second, we establish the $C^0$-rigidity of coisotropic submanifolds in Poisson manifolds. A key ingredient is the notion of ''clean intersection point'' between a submanifold and the leaves of a singular foliation, whose study is of independent interest for singular foliation theory and Poisson geometry. In contrast with the symplectic case, characteristic foliations of coisotropic submanifolds are not rigid under Poisson homeomorphisms, exhibiting flexibility phenomena specific to the Poisson setting. We discuss partial rigidity results, introduce a topological invariant of coisotropic submanifolds, the $C^0$-characteristic partition, and show that $C^0$-coisotropic submanifolds are non-smooth objects whose vanishing ideal defines a Lie subalgebra of the Poisson algebra. Finally, we consider Poisson homeomorphisms that lift to symplectic homeomorphisms of a symplectic realization and show that nearly all Poisson manifolds admit non-liftable Poisson homeomorphisms. Our main results answer three questions posed by Joksimovi\'c and M\u{a}rcu\c{t}.</description>

Abstract: We study complete conformal gradient solitons, a class containing gradient Yamabe solitons and many generalized Yamabe-type structures, including gradient almost Yamabe, gradient k-Yamabe, and gradient h-almost Yamabe solitons, and, after a change of the potential function, gradient Einstein-type manifolds with $\alpha=0$ and $\beta\neq0$ (in particular, quasi-Yamabe solitons). In this paper, we classify complete nontrivial locally conformally flat conformal gradient solitons. This result contributes to an analogue of Perelman's conjecture for Yamabe-type solitons. Moreover, we show that under nonnegative scalar curvature, every nonflat soliton is rotationally symmetric. We also obtain classifications assuming the Cotton or Cao-Chen tensor vanishes.</description>

      <title>The $k$th Order Preserving Sets and Isoperimetric Type Inequalities for Planar Ovals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and investigate a new class of sets, the \textit{$k$th Order Preserving Sets}, arising naturally from the Fourier analysis of support functions associated with hedgehogs. Specifically, we focus on sets whose support functions possess a Fourier series that preserves only terms with positive indices divisible by a fixed $k$.
  We explore the geometry of the \textit{$k$th Order Midpoint Set}, defined as the set of centroids of all equiangular $k$-gons circumscribed about a given hedgehog. This set captures essential structural and symmetry-related features of the underlying geometric configuration.
  We study the geometric properties of such sets and, in particular, establish an isoperimetric-type inequality relating the perimeter and area of a region bounded by a simple smooth convex closed curve (an oval) $\mathcal{O}$: \[ L_{\mathcal{O}}^2 - 4\pi A_{\mathcal{O}} \geqslant 4\pi |A_{\mathcal{P}_k}| + 2\pi |A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}|, \] where $L_{\mathcal{O}}$ denotes the length (perimeter) of $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the area of the region enclosed by $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{P}_k}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Preserving Set $\mathcal{P}_k$, and $A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Midpoint Set $\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}$. Moreover, we characterize the equality case: the inequality becomes an equality if and only if every equiangular circumscribed $k$-gon around $\mathcal{O}$ is a~regular $k$-gon with its center of mass located at the Steiner point of $\mathcal{O}$.</description>

      <title>An improved upper bound for the second eigenvalue on tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximization problem of the second non-zero Laplace eigenvalue $\lambda_2(T,g)$ on a torus $T$, among all unit-area metrics in a fixed conformal class. First, we obtain a new upper bound for $\lambda_2(T_{a,b},g)$ on any flat torus $T_{a, b}$ with $(a, b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$. Our bound improves the general estimate $\lambda_2(T_{a, b},g)\le 4A_c(T_{a, b}, [g])$ in the case of the torus. As applications, we derive a uniform upper bound $\lambda_2(T,g)&lt; \frac{16\pi^2}{\sqrt{3}}$ for any torus $T$ and any metric $g$, and reduce the Kao-Lai-Osting conjecture to proving an upper bound for $\lambda_2(T_{a,b},g)$ on the specific family of flat tori $T_{a,b}$ with $0\leq a\leq \frac12$ and $\sqrt{1-a^2}\leq b\leq 1.76$.</description>

      <title>Pluriclosed metrics on compact semisimple Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact semisimple Lie group G and a maximal torus T of G, we give an explicit description of all left and Ad(T)-invariant pluriclosed Hermitian structures on G in terms of the corresponding root system. They depend on 2d+1 parameters in the irreducible case, where dim(T)=2d. As applications, we obtain that the only left and Ad(T)-invariant pluriclosed metrics which are also CYT are bi-invariant metrics (i.e., Bismut flat) and study the pluriclosed flow as a neat ODE system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a broad family of noncompact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds, the corresponding homogeneous Ricci flow solutions have finite extinction time, thereby confirming the dynamical Alekseevskii conjecture for these spaces. As an application, we prove that on such homogeneous manifolds $G/H$, the space of all $G$-invariant positive scalar curvature metrics is contractible.</description>

      <title>Concavity of spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent breathtaking progress in the synthetic study of Lorentzian geometry, we investigate the local concavity of time separation functions on Finsler spacetimes as a Lorentzian counterpart to Busemann's convexity in metric geometry. We show that a Berwald spacetime is locally concave if and only if its flag curvature is nonnegative in timelike directions. We also give another characterization of nonnegative flag curvature by the convexity of future (or past) capsules, inspired by Krist\'aly--Kozma's result in the positive definite case. These characterizations are new even for Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the First Non-zero Basic Eigenvalue on a Singular Riemannian Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem of the Lorentzian Dirac operator with APS boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with timelike boundary and show well-posedness of the Cauchy initial-boundary value problem coupled to APS-boundary conditions. This is achieved by deriving suitable energy estimates, which play a fundamental role in establishing uniqueness and existence of weak solutions. Finally, by introducing suitable mollifier operators, we study the differentiability of the solutions. For obtaining smoothness we need additional technical conditions.</description>

      <title>The Eigenvalue Problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of the first eigenvalue and an associated eigenfunction with Dirichlet condition for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator on a bounded strongly pseudoconvex domain in $\C^n$. We show that the eigenfunction is plurisubharmonic, smooth with bounded Laplacian in $\Omega$ and boundary values $0$. Moreover it is unique up to a positive multiplicative constant.
  To this end, we follow the strategy used by P.L. Lions in the real case. However, we have to prove a new theorem on the existence of solutions for some special complex degenerate Monge-Amp\`ere equations. This requires establishing new a priori estimates of the gradient and Laplacian of such solutions using methods and results of L. Caffarelli, J.J. Kohn, L. Nirenberg and J. Spruck \cite{CKNS85} and B. Guan \cite{GuanB98}.
  Finally we provide a Pluripotential variational approach to the problem and using our new existence theorem, we prove a Rayleigh quotient type formula for the first eigenvalue of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator.</description>

      <title>Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or on spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \emph{Koopman Regularization} is a constrained optimization-based method to learn the governing equations from sparse and corrupted samples of the vector field. \emph{Koopman Regularization} extracts a functionally independent set of Koopman Eigenfunctions from the samples. This set implements the principle of parsimony, since, even though its cardinality is finite, it restores the dynamics precisely.
  \emph{Koopman Regularization} formulates the Koopman Partial Differential Equation as the objective function and the condition of functional independence as the feasible region. Then, this work suggests a barrier method-based algorithm to solve this constrained optimization problem that yields promising results in denoising, generalization, and dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce to spectral noncommutative geometry the notion of tangled spectral triple, which encompasses the anisotropies arising in parabolic geometry as well as the parabolic commutator bounds arising in so-called "bad Kasparov products". Tangled spectral triples incorporate anisotropy by replacing the unbounded operator in a spectral triple that mimics a Dirac operator with several unbounded operators mimicking directional Dirac operators. We allow for varying and dependent orders in different directions, controlled by using the tools of tropical combinatorics. We study the conformal equivariance of tangled spectral triples as well as how they fit into $K$-homology by means of producing higher order spectral triples. Our main examples are hypoelliptic spectral triples constructed from Rockland complexes on parabolic geometries; we also build spectral triples on nilpotent group $C^*$-algebras from the dual Dirac element and crossed product spectral triples for parabolic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian approach for PDE-constrained shape optimization over the diffeomorphism group using outer metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of outer metrics, in particular Sobolev-type metrics on the diffeomorphism group in the context of PDE-constrained shape optimization. Leveraging the structure of the diffeomorphism group we analyze the connection between the push-forward of a smooth function defined on the diffeomorphism group and the classical shape derivative as an Eulerian semi-derivative. We consider in particular, two predominant examples on PDE-constrained shape optimization. An electric impedance tomography inspired problem, and the optimization of a two-dimensional bridge. These problems are numerically solved using the Riemannian steepest descent method where the descent directions are taken to be the Riemannian gradients associated to various outer metrics. For comparison reasons, we also solve the problem using other previously proposed Riemannian metrics in particular the Steklov-Poincar\'e metric.</description>

      <title>Varifold solutions to Volume-Preserving Mean Curvature Flow: existence and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution we introduce a novel weak solution concept for two-phase volume-preserving mean curvature flow, having both properties of unconditional global-in-time existence and weak-strong uniqueness. These solutions extend the ones proposed by Hensel-Laux [J. Differential Geom. 130, 209-268 (2025)] for the standard mean curvature flow, and consist in evolving varifolds coupled with the phase volumes by a transport equation. First, we show that, in the same setting as in Takasao [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 247, 52 (2023)], any sharp interface limit of solutions to a slightly modified nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation is a varifold solution according to our new definition. Secondly, we crucially introduce a new notion of volume-preserving gradient-flow calibrations, allowing the extended velocity vector field to point in the normal direction on the interface. We show that any sufficiently regular strong solution is calibrated in this sense. Finally, we prove that any classical solution to volume-preserving mean curvature flow, which is then automatically a calibrated flow, is unique in the class of our new varifold solutions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Spectral Encodings under Weyl Growth Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the geometric Weyl bulk-density exponent $(d-2)/2$ rigidifies spectral encodings $C=\pi-\phi(\lambda)$ in the O-regularly varying class: the bulk power law forces $\phi\in\mathrm{RV}_1$ (asymptotic linearity). For polynomial-type encodings $C=\pi-\epsilon\lambda^k L(\lambda)$ with $L\in\mathrm{RV}_0$, this yields the unique admissible exponent $k=1$. The affine encoding then gives $N_{\mu_C}(C)\sim\gamma_d\,\epsilon^{-d/2}(\pi-C)^{d/2}$ as $C\to-\infty$, allowing recovery of $d$ and $\gamma_d$ from bulk encoded data. This transfer is stable under perturbations $\delta(\lambda)=o(\lambda)$, with explicit slowly varying error control. We further formalize asymptotic spectral equivalence classes: if $\phi\in\mathrm{RV}_k$, the induced map scales asymptotic spectral dimension as $d_{\mathrm{as}}\mapsto d_{\mathrm{as}}/k$; hence dimension preservation is equivalent to $\phi\in\mathrm{RV}_1$, with strict affine normalization at first order when $L(\lambda)\to1$.</description>

      <title>The Regularity of Critical Points to Scale-Invariant Curvature Energies in Dimension 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of scale-invariant curvature energies defined on immersed $4$-dimensional manifolds and prove that weak immersions that are critical points of such energies are analytic in any given local harmonic chart. Because of the criticality of this variational problem, the regularity result is obtained through the identification of conservation laws by applying Noether theorem. The resulting identities generate a lower order elliptic system of PDEs to which methods from integrability by compensation and interpolation theory are applied.</description>
