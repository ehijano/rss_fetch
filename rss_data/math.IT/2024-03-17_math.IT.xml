      <title>Joint Group Scheduling and Multicast Beamforming for Downlink Large-Scale Multi-Group Multicast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks need to handle massive user access effectively. This paper addresses the problem of joint group scheduling and multicast beamforming for downlink multicast with many active groups. Aiming to maximize the minimum user throughput, we propose a three-phase approach to tackle this difficult joint optimization problem efficiently. In Phase 1, we utilize the optimal multicast beamforming structure obtained recently to find the group-channel directions for all groups. We propose two low-complexity scheduling algorithms in Phase 2, which determine the subset of groups in each time slot sequentially and the total number of time slots required for all groups. The first algorithm measures the level of spatial separation among groups and selects the dissimilar groups that maximize the minimum user rate into the same time slot. In contrast, the second algorithm first identifies the spatially correlated groups via a learning-based clustering method based on the group-channel directions, and then separates spatially similar groups into different time slots. Finally, the multicast beamformers for the scheduled groups are obtained in each time slot by a computationally efficient method. Simulation results show that our proposed approaches can effectively capture the level of spatial separation among groups for scheduling to improve the minimum user throughput over the conventional approach that serves all groups in a single time slot or one group per time slot, and can be executed with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and (2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry. Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.</description>

      <title>Fairness Optimization for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the fair transmission design for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). IRS is used to establish a good signal propagation environment and enhance the RSMA transmission performance. The fair rate adaption problem is constructed as a max-min optimization problem. To solve the optimization problem, we adopt an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the power allocation, beamforming, and decoding order, respectively. A generalized power iteration (GPI) method is proposed to optimize the receive beamforming, which can improve the minimum rate of devices and reduce the optimization complexity. At the base station (BS), a successive group decoding (SGD) algorithm is proposed to tackle the uplink signal estimation, which trades off the fairness and complexity of decoding. At the same time, we also consider robust communication with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which studies robust optimization by using lower bound expressions on the expected data rates. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm can significantly improve the performance of fairness. It also provides reliable results for uplink communication with imperfect CSIT.</description>

      <title>Matrix Completion via Nonsmooth Regularization of Fully Connected Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional matrix completion methods approximate the missing values by assuming the matrix to be low-rank, which leads to a linear approximation of missing values. It has been shown that enhanced performance could be attained by using nonlinear estimators such as deep neural networks. Deep fully connected neural networks (FCNNs), one of the most suitable architectures for matrix completion, suffer from over-fitting due to their high capacity, which leads to low generalizability. In this paper, we control over-fitting by regularizing the FCNN model in terms of the $\ell_{1}$ norm of intermediate representations and nuclear norm of weight matrices. As such, the resulting regularized objective function becomes nonsmooth and nonconvex, i.e., existing gradient-based methods cannot be applied to our model. We propose a variant of the proximal gradient method and investigate its convergence to a critical point. In the initial epochs of FCNN training, the regularization terms are ignored, and through epochs, the effect of that increases. The gradual addition of nonsmooth regularization terms is the main reason for the better performance of the deep neural network with nonsmooth regularization terms (DNN-NSR) algorithm. Our simulations indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with existing linear and nonlinear algorithms.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Information as a Privacy Constraint for Adversarial Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies a privacy metric based on Chernoff information, \textit{Chernoff differential privacy}, due to its significance in characterization of classifier performance. Adversarial classification, as any other classification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct detection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the case of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem, where the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately resulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work, we focus on the Bayesian setting and characterize the relationship between the best error exponent of the average error probability and $\varepsilon-$differential privacy. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff differential privacy in terms of $\varepsilon-$differential privacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative and show that it satisfies the composition property. Subsequently, we present numerical evaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$, the impact of the adversary's attack and global sensitivity for the problem of adversarial classification in Laplace mechanisms.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Physical Layer Security in Emerging RF and Optical Wireless Communication Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) has received a growing interest from the research community for its ability to safeguard data confidentiality without relying on key distribution or encryption/decryption. However, the evolution towards the 5G technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless networks. Among the potential enabling technologies, RIS has attracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat dynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be adopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both RF and OWC systems. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the information-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article first discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed by their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some optimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system model, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a comprehensive performance analysis. Given that the computational complexity of future communication systems that adopt RIS-assisted PLS is likely to increase rapidly as the number of interactions between the users and infrastructure grows, ML is seen as a promising approach to address this complexity issue while sustaining or improving the network performance. A discussion of recent research studies on RIS-assisted PLS-based systems embedded with ML is presented. Furthermore, some important open research challenges are proposed and discussed to provide insightful future research directions, with the aim of moving a step closer towards the development and implementation of the forthcoming 6G wireless technology.</description>

      <title>Decentralizing Coherent Joint Transmission Precoding via Deterministic Equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to control the inter-cell interference for a multi-cell multi-user multiple-input multiple-output network, we consider the precoder design for coordinated multi-point with downlink coherent joint transmission. To avoid costly information exchange among the cooperating base stations in a centralized precoding scheme, we propose a decentralized one by considering the power minimization problem. By approximating the inter-cell interference using the deterministic equivalents, this problem is decoupled to sub-problems which are solved in a decentralized manner at different base stations. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed decentralized precoding scheme, where only 2 ~ 7% more transmit power is needed compared with the optimal centralized precoder.</description>

      <title>Learning on JPEG-LDPC Compressed Images: Classifying with Syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In goal-oriented communications, the objective of the receiver is often to apply a Deep-Learning model, rather than reconstructing the original data. In this context, direct learning over compressed data, without any prior decoding, holds promise for enhancing the time-efficient execution of inference models at the receiver. However, conventional entropic-coding methods like Huffman and Arithmetic break data structure, rendering them unsuitable for learning without decoding. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach in which entropic coding is realized with Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes. We hypothesize that Deep Learning models can more effectively exploit the internal code structure of LDPC codes. At the receiver, we leverage a specific class of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), trained for image classification. Our numerical results indicate that classification based on LDPC-coded bit-planes surpasses Huffman and Arithmetic coding, while necessitating a significantly smaller learning model. This demonstrates the efficiency of classification directly from LDPC-coded data, eliminating the need for any form of decompression, even partial, prior to applying the learning model.</description>

      <title>Optimal Block-Level Draft Verification for Accelerating Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has shown to be an effective method for lossless acceleration of large language models (LLMs) during inference. In each iteration, the algorithm first uses a smaller model to draft a block of tokens. The tokens are then verified by the large model in parallel and only a subset of tokens will be kept to guarantee that the final output follows the distribution of the large model. In all of the prior speculative decoding works, the draft verification is performed token-by-token independently. In this work, we propose a better draft verification algorithm that provides additional wall-clock speedup without incurring additional computation cost and draft tokens. We first formulate the draft verification step as a block-level optimal transport problem. The block-level formulation allows us to consider a wider range of draft verification algorithms and obtain a higher number of accepted tokens in expectation in one draft block. We propose a verification algorithm that achieves the optimal accepted length for the block-level transport problem. We empirically evaluate our proposed block-level verification algorithm in a wide range of tasks and datasets, and observe consistent improvements in wall-clock speedup when compared to token-level verification algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish improvement over speculative decoding through a better draft verification algorithm.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Exchangeable Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a complexity measure for exchangeable graphs by considering the graph-generating mechanism. Exchangeability for graphs implies distributional invariance under node permutations, making it a suitable default model for a wide range of graph data. For this well-studied class of graphs, we quantify complexity using graphon entropy. Graphon entropy is a graph property, meaning it is invariant under graph isomorphisms. Therefore, we focus on estimating the entropy of the generating mechanism for a graph realization, rather than selecting a specific graph feature. This approach allows us to consider the global properties of a graph, capturing its important graph-theoretic and topological characteristics, such as sparsity, symmetry, and connectedness. We introduce a consistent graphon entropy estimator that achieves the nonparametric rate for any arbitrary exchangeable graph with a smooth graphon representative. Additionally, we develop tailored entropy estimators for situations where more information about the underlying graphon is available, specifically for widely studied random graph models such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Configuration Model and Stochastic Block Model. We determine their large-sample properties by providing a Central Limit Theorem for the first two, and a convergence rate for the third model. We also conduct a simulation study to illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the connection between graphon entropy and graph structure. Finally, we investigate the role of our entropy estimator as a complexity measure for characterizing real-world graphs.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Positioning and Attitude Sensing Based on Electromagnetic Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positioning and sensing over wireless networks are imperative for many emerging applications. However, since traditional wireless channel models over-simplify the user equipment (UE) as a point target, they cannot be used for sensing the attitude of the UE, which is typically described by the spatial orientation. In this paper, a comprehensive electromagnetic propagation modeling (EPM) based on electromagnetic theory is developed to precisely model the near-field channel. For the noise-free case, the EPM model establishes the non-linear functional dependence of observed signals on both the position and attitude of the UE. To address the difficulty in the non-linear coupling, we first propose to divide the distance domain into three regions, separated by the defined Phase ambiguity distance and Spacing constraint distance. Then, for each region, we obtain the closed-form solutions for joint position and attitude estimation with low complexity. Next, to investigate the impact of random noise on the joint estimation performance, the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) is derived to yield useful insights. The expected Cram\'er-Rao bound (ECRB) is further provided to obtain the simplified closed-form expressions for the performance lower bounds. Our numerical results demonstrate that the derived ZZB can provide accurate predictions of the performance of estimators in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. More importantly, we achieve the millimeter-level accuracy in position estimation and attain the 0.1-level accuracy in attitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source Channel Coding With Attention Modules Over MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two deep joint source and channel coding (DJSCC) structures with attention modules for the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel, including a serial structure and a parallel structure. With singular value decomposition (SVD)-based precoding scheme, the MIMO channel can be decomposed into various sub-channels, and the feature outputs will experience sub-channels with different channel qualities. In the serial structure, one single network is used at both the transmitter and the receiver to jointly process data streams of all MIMO subchannels, while data steams of different MIMO subchannels are processed independently via multiple sub-networks in the parallel structure. The attention modules in both serial and parallel architectures enable the system to adapt to varying channel qualities and adjust the quantity of information outputs in accordance with the channel qualities. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed DJSCC structures have improved image transmission performance, and reveal the phenomenon via non-parameter entropy estimation that the learned DJSCC transceivers tend to transmit more information over better sub-channels.</description>

Abstract: Strong blocking sets, introduced first in 2011 in connection with saturating sets, have recently gained a lot of attention due to their correspondence with minimal codes. In this paper, we dig into the geometry of the concatenation method, introducing the concept of outer strong blocking sets and their coding theoretical counterpart. We investigate their structure and provide bounds on their size. As a byproduct, we improve the best-known upper bound on the minimum size of a strong blocking set. Finally, we present a geometric construction of small strong blocking sets, whose computational cost is significantly smaller than the previously known ones.</description>

      <title>Concrete Quantum Channels and Algebraic Structure of Abstract Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article analyzes the algebraic structure of the set of all quantum channels and its subset consisting of quantum channels that have Holevo representation. The regularity of these semigroups under composition of mappings are analysed. It is also known that these sets are compact convex sets and, therefore, rich in geometry. An attempt is made to identify generalized invertible channels and also the idempotent channels. When channels are of the Holevo type, these two problems are fully studied in this article. The motivation behind this study is its applicability to the reversibility of channel transformations and recent developments in resource-destroying channels, which are idempotents. This is related to the coding-encoding problem in quantum information theory. Several examples are provided, with the main examples coming from pre-conditioner maps which assigns preconditioners to matrices, in numerical linear algebra.Thus the known pre-conditioner maps are viewd as a quantum-channel in finite dimentions.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great success in various tasks related to inverse problems, where a target quantity of interest can only be observed through indirect measurements by a forward operator. Common approaches apply deep neural networks in a post-processing step to the reconstructions obtained by classical reconstruction methods. However, the latter methods can be computationally expensive and introduce artifacts that are not present in the measured data and, in turn, can deteriorate the performance on the given task. To overcome these limitations, we propose a class of equivariant neural networks that can be directly applied to the measurements to solve the desired task. To this end, we build appropriate network structures by developing layers that are equivariant with respect to data transformations induced by well-known symmetries in the domain of the forward operator. We rigorously analyze the relation between the measurement operator and the resulting group representations and prove a representer theorem that characterizes the class of linear operators that translate between a given pair of group actions. Based on this theory, we extend the existing concepts of Lie group equivariant deep learning to inverse problems and introduce new representations that result from the involved measurement operations. This allows us to efficiently solve classification, regression or even reconstruction tasks based on indirect measurements also for very sparse data problems, where a classical reconstruction-based approach may be hard or even impossible. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in numerical experiments and compare with existing methods.</description>

Abstract: In this note we highlight some connections of UMAP to the basic principles of Information Geometry. Originally, UMAP was derived from Category Theory observations. However, we posit that it also has a natural geometric interpretation.</description>
