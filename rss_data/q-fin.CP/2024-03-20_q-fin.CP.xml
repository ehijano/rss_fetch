      <title>Mean-field neural networks-based algorithms for McKean-Vlasov control problems *</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the numerical resolution of McKean-Vlasov control problems via the class of mean-field neural networks introduced in our companion paper [25] in order to learn the solution on the Wasserstein space. We propose several algorithms either based on dynamic programming with control learning by policy or value iteration, or backward SDE from stochastic maximum principle with global or local loss functions. Extensive numerical results on different examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy of each of our eight algorithms. We discuss and compare the pros and cons of all the tested methods.</description>

      <title>Residual U-net with Self-Attention to Solve Multi-Agent Time-Consistent Optimal Trade Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a deep residual U-net with self-attention to solve the the continuous time time-consistent mean variance optimal trade execution problem for multiple agents and assets. Given a finite horizon we formulate the time-consistent mean-variance optimal trade execution problem following the Almgren-Chriss model as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The HJB formulation is known to have a viscosity solution to the unknown value function. We reformulate the HJB to a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) to extend the problem to multiple agents and assets. We utilize a residual U-net with self-attention to numerically approximate the value function for multiple agents and assets which can be used to determine the time-consistent optimal control. In this paper, we show that the proposed neural network approach overcomes the limitations of finite difference methods. We validate our results and study parameter sensitivity. With our framework we study how an agent with significant price impact interacts with an agent without any price impact and the optimal strategies used by both types of agents. We also study the performance of multiple sellers and buyers and how they compare to a holding strategy under different economic conditions.</description>
