      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>Violent mergers revisited: The origin of the fastest stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae.
  Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically.
  However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves.
  Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation.
  We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object.
  The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs.
  We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$.
  Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.</description>

      <title>Eruptive mass loss less than a year before the explosion of superluminous supernovae. II. A systematic search for pre-explosion eruptions with VLT/X-shooter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-shooter observations of a sample of 21 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), spanning a redshift range of z=0.13-0.95, aimed at searching for shells of circumstellar material (CSM). Specifically, we focus on identifying broad Mg II absorption features that are blueshifted by several thousand kilometers per second and have previously been interpreted as arising from resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding CSM ejected shortly before explosion. Utilizing high-quality spectra, we model the region around 2800A to characterize the Mg II line profiles, enabling us to either confirm their presence or place constraints on undetected CSM shells. We identify five objects in our sample that show broad Mg II absorption features consistent with the presence of CSM. While SN2018ibb, SN2020xga and SN2022xgc have been previously reported, we identify previously undiscovered CSM shells in DES15S2nr and DES16C3ggu. These shells were likely expelled approximately two and three months, respectively, before the explosion of their associated SNe, timescales consistent with late-stage mass-loss episodes. We do not find any correlations between the shell properties and the SN properties, except for a marginal correlation between the light curve decline time scale and the shell velocities. We further demonstrate that CSM configurations similar to the majority of the detected shells would have been observable in spectra with signal-to-noise &gt;8 per resolution element, and that the lines from a shell are in general detectable except in the cases where the shell is either very geometrically and/or optically thin. Therefore, we conclude that the detection of CSM shells is not a selection effect, but may instead point to the existence of a subclass of SLSNe-I undergoing late-stage shell ejections shortly before explosion.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet radiation and neutrinos: two messengers from CCSNe in the CSM scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars (&gt;8 $M_{\odot}$) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the UV/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN-CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT. We then discuss the prospects for multi-messenger observations of such events in the near future.</description>

      <title>Rotation of Polarization Angle in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Phase. III. The Influence of the Magnetic Field Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization is very sensitive to the configuration of the magnetic field in the radiation region. In addition to polarization curve and polarization spectrum, studies of polarization angle (PA) rotation spectrum is also crucial. In this paper, we use a simple parametric magnetic reconnection model with a large-scale aligned magnetic field in the radiation region to study the effects of field orientation on the PA rotations. Under different field orientations, variations of the PA rotation with parameters and the PA rotation spectra are studied. We find that the conclusions obtained in our previous works are almost independent of the field orientations. The area of the parameter space with $\Delta$PA $&gt;10^\circ$ will shrink as the value of field orientation ($\delta$) increases for $0^\circ&lt;\delta&lt;90^\circ$. The $\Delta$PA values would be the same for two complementary field orientations. For two particular magnetic field orientations ($\delta=0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$), the $\Delta$PA would also only be $0^\circ$ or $90^\circ$ within the burst duration.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cosmic Ray Acceleration on the Early Evolution of Bow Shocks around Massive Runaway Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bow shocks generated from the interaction of winds from massive runaway stars with the interstellar medium have been shown to be prominent particle accelerators through recent $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron observations. Here, we study particle acceleration from bow shocks by conducting 3D ideal cosmic ray magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the advection-diffusion limit. We use the Eulerian grid-based code FLASH, where stellar winds are injected through tabulated wind velocities and mass loss rates. We implement a gradient-based shock detection algorithm to resolve the shocked regions where the CRs are injected dynamically. Simulations are performed for different values of the CR diffusion coefficient and star velocities within an ISM-like environment up to 180 kyr to showcase the impact of dynamical CR injection on the early evolution of the wind-driven bow shock. With a simplified spectral model in post-processing, we calculate the expected upper limits of $\gamma$-ray and synchrotron emission and compare with those from current observations. We observe that variations of CR diffusion rates can strongly dictate the morphology of the bow shock and the overall $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron luminosity due to the balance between the CR injection efficiency and diffusion. Our results yield qualitatively comparable results with current observations, primarily attributed to the high-energy protons and electrons contributing to non-thermal emission from efficient acceleration at the forward shock through the approximations and assumptions in the injection algorithm. We conclude that CR acceleration, with varying CR diffusion rates, may substantially affect the morphology of wind-driven bow shocks and their non-thermal emission, if there is efficient particle acceleration in the forward shock.

      <title>Fe XVIII-XXIV K beta Inner-shell Absorption Lines in the X-ray Spectra of Neutron Star and Black Hole Binaries with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer Resolve onboard the XRISM space telescope opened a new era for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of astrophysical plasmas. Many spectral features were newly detected, including the K alpha and K beta inner-shell transition lines of mildly ionized (F- to Li-like) Fe at 6-8 keV in the spectra of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The widely used atomic databases contain information on the K alpha but not K beta lines of these ions. We conducted the atomic structure calculation using FAC to derive the Fe K alpha and K beta lines and verified the result against ground experiments and other calculations of the Fe K alpha lines. We then implemented the Fe K beta lines in a radiative transfer code (cloudy) and compared the synthesized and observed spectra with XRISM. A reasonably good agreement was obtained between the observation and the ab initio calculations. This exemplifies the need to expand the atomic databases to interpret astrophysical spectra.</description>

      <title>Lanthanide Impact on the Infra-Red Spectra of Nebular Phase Kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nebular phase kilonovae (KNe) have significant infra-red (IR) emission thought to be mostly forbidden emission lines from rapid neutron capture (r-process) species in neutron star merger ejecta. Lanthanide elements in particular have complex atomic structures with many IR transitions. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer simulations, we explore the impact of lanthanides on the IR spectra of KNe in the nebular phase, exploring a parameter space of ejecta mass and lanthanide fraction. We find that lanthanide impact is greater at higher densities, corresponding to earlier epochs and greater ejecta masses. The wavelengths most affected are found to be $\lambda \lesssim 4~\mu$m, with the species Ce\,\textsc{iii} and Nd \textsc{ii} being the most important contributors to spectral formation. We also find significant emission from species proposed in observations, notably Te\,\textsc{iii} at 2.1 $\mu$m, and Se\,\textsc{iii} at 4.5 and 5.7 $\mu$m, while W\,\textsc{iii} is subdominant at 4.5 $\mu$m. The Te\,\textsc{iii} feature at 2.1 $\mu$m is always blended, particularly with Zr\,\textsc{ii}, Ce\,\textsc{iii}, and Nd\,\textsc{ii}. We do not reproduce the smooth blackbody-like continua observed in AT2023vfi. Based on our results, we argue that line opacity alone is likely insufficient to produce optically thick continua in the nebular phase, even in the case of lanthanide/actinide-rich ejecta, as our models are optically thin in the IR at these epochs. Given that lanthanide contributions are dominant below 4 $\mu$m, we suggest that NIR observations best probe these elements, while MIR spectroscopy with \textit{JWST} can reliably probe non-lanthanide emission even in relatively lanthanide-rich cases.</description>

      <title>Optically thick winds of very massive stars suppress intermediate-mass black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Gravitational waves have started unveiling a population of IMBHs in the $\sim 100-300 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ range. Here, we investigate the formation of IMBHs from very massive stars (VMSs, $&gt;100\,{} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We calculate new VMS models that account for the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, and study how this enhanced mass loss affects IMBH formation and the black hole mass function at intermediate and high metallicity ($Z=10^{-4}-0.02$). We show that optically thick winds suppress the formation of IMBHs from direct VMS collapse at metallicities $Z&gt;0.001$, one order of magnitude lower than predicted by previous models. Our models indicate that the stellar progenitors of GW231123 must have had a metallicity $Z&lt;0.002$, if the primary black hole formed via direct VMS collapse.</description>

      <title>DIPLODOCUS II: Implementation of transport equations and test cases relevant to micro-scale physics of jetted astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the general transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including forcing terms and interactions between particles. Following Paper I, which details the background analytic framework, this second paper provides an overview of the numerical implementation in the form of the code package Diplodocus.jl, written in Julia, including the description of a novel Monte-Carlo sampling technique for the pre-computation of anisotropic collision integrals. In addition to the discussion of numerical implementation, a selection of test cases are presented to examine the package's capabilities. These test cases focus on micro-scale physical effects: binary collisions, emissive interactions and external forces that are relevant to the modelling of jetted astrophysical sources, such as Active Galactic Nuclei and X-Ray Binaries.</description>

      <title>The double neutron star PSR J1946+2052 I. Masses and tests of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted high-precision timing of PSR J1946+2052 to determine the masses of the two neutron stars in the system, test general relativity (GR) and assessed the system's potential for future measurement of the moment of inertia of the pulsar. We analysed seven years of timing data from the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The data processing accounted for dispersion measure variations and relativistic spin precession-induced profile evolution. We employed both DDFWHE and DDGR binary models to measure the spin parameters, kinematic parameters and orbital parameters. The timing campaign has resulted in the precise measurement of five post-Keplerian parameters, which yield very precise masses for the system and three tests of general relativity. One of these is the second most precise test of the radiative properties of gravity to date: the intrinsic orbital decay, $\dot{P}_{\rm b,int}=-1.8288(16)\times10^{-12}\rm\,s\,s^{-1}$, represents $1.00005(91)$ of the GR prediction, indicating that the theory has passed this stringent test. The other two tests, of the Shapiro delay parameters, have precisions of 6\% and 5\% respectively; this is caused by the moderate orbital inclination of the system, $\sim 74^{\circ}$; the measurements of the Shapiro delay parameters also agree with the GR predictions. Additionally, we analysed the higher-order contributions of $\dot{\omega}$, including the Lense-Thirring contribution. Both the second post-Newtonian and the Lense-Thirring contributions are larger than the current uncertainty of $\dot{\omega}$ ($\delta\dot{\omega}=4\times10^{-4}\,\rm deg\,yr^{-1}$), leading to the higher-order correction for the total mass.</description>

      <title>Gamma-rays from Wolf-Rayet stellar winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray observations of young star clusters have recently provided evidence for particle acceleration occurring at stellar wind termination shocks, fueled by the mechanical energy of stellar winds from massive stars. In this work, we explore the possibility that the wind from a single powerful star, whether isolated or part of a cluster, can alone provide sufficient energy to generate gamma-ray emission detectable by current instruments. This scenario is particularly relevant given that a significant fraction of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are not found within clusters. To investigate this, we compiled a large sample of WR stars and ranked them based on their wind luminosity divided by the square of their distance, a proxy for their potential gamma-ray flux. We then searched for spatial coincidences between the most promising candidates and cataloged gamma-ray sources. This analysis leads us to propose associations between the stars WR14, WR110, WR111, and WR114 and several unidentified gamma-ray sources. These results suggest that WR stellar winds could represent a distinct and previously unrecognized population of gamma-ray emitters.</description>

      <title>Modeling gamma-ray signatures of particle acceleration in stellar clusters from GeV to PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have recently regained interest as PeVatron candidates, potentially accounting for the cosmic-ray (CR) knee as alternatives to isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). LHAASO's unique capability to detect photons above 0.1 PeV, hence tracing multi-PeV CRs, can provide critical constraints on galactic acceleration models when combined with H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT data. We investigate the transport of particles from YMSCs acceleration sites, namely wind termination shocks (WTS) or embedded SNRs, to nearby dense molecular clouds where proton-proton interactions produce high-energy gamma rays. We determine the necessary conditions, such as the distance between the acceleration site and the target, or the cluster's power and age, for detectable gamma-ray excesses and identify viable systems through parameter space exploration. By comparing with observations, we can constrain key physical parameters including WTS efficiency, diffusion coefficient and injection slope. Our analysis also examines whether some of LHAASO's unidentified sources might correspond to such cluster-cloud systems.</description>

      <title>JWST and Keck Observations of the Off-Nuclear TDE AT 2024tvd: A Massive Nuclear Star Cluster and Minor-Merger Origin for its Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = 5.50\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\log (\dot{M}/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere radius of $\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \pm 0.1$. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with $T_{dust} = 873\pm 15$ K and peak luminosity $\log (L_{dust}/erg$ $s^{-1}) = 40.80\pm 0.01$, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to $\log(M_{\star}/M_\odot) = 7.97^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Energy calibration of LHAASO-KM2A using the cosmic ray Moon shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a precise measurement of the westward, rigidity-dependent shift of the Moon's shadow using three and a half years of cosmic-ray data collected by the Kilometer Square Array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). These measurements enable us to calibrate the detector energy response in the range 20-260 TeV, with results showing excellent agreement with the response derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the KM2A detector. We also measure a best-fit parameter $\epsilon = 0.015 \pm 0.08$, corresponding to a 95% confidence interval of [-14%, +17%] for the energy-scale estimation. This result establishes the exceptional accuracy of the KM2A-MC in simulating the detector's response within this energy range.</description>

      <title>The Influence of the Accretion Disc Structure on X-ray Spectral States in Symbiotic Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binary systems where a white dwarf (WD) accretes material from the wind of an evolved, late-type companion. X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems are classified into $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, and $\beta/\delta$ types, attributed to distinct physical mechanisms such as thermonuclear burning, wind interactions, and accretion-driven boundary layers. We present synthetic X-ray spectra derived from hydrodynamics simulations using the PHANTOM code, coupled with radiative-transfer calculations from SKIRT. We reproduce all X-ray spectral types by exploring different density structure of the accretion disc, the viewing angle, the plasma temperature of the boundary layer, and/or the presence of extended emission. The synthetic X-ray spectra consist of both absorbed and reflected components. In systems with massive, high-column density discs and viewing angles close to edge-on, the reflected continuum can dominate the X-ray emission. This effect is less pronounced in systems with low-mass, lower-column density discs. We explore i) systems going from $\delta$ to $\beta$ states, ii) $\delta$-types that become $\beta/\delta$ sources, iii) the variability of the three Fe emission lines in the 6.0-7.0 energy range, and iv) the possible physical processes behind the $\alpha$ sources. The observations from iconic symbiotic systems are discussed in line of the present models. Our framework offers predictive power for future X-ray monitoring and provides a path toward connecting accretion disc physics with observed spectral states in symbiotic binaries with accreting WDs.</description>

      <title>Tycho supernova exploded inside a planetary nebula (SNIP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine recent observations of the type Ia supernova remnant (SNR Ia) Tycho and conclude that Tycho is an SN Ia inside a planetary nebula (SNIP). The observations reveal two opposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The pair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and SNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that the explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation of the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the core-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible scenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification of Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs among normal SNe Ia is very large, ~70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal SNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay time distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution timescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar populations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the younger stellar populations in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Perseus Galaxy Cluster with XRISM: Gas Kinematic Features and their Implications for Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present extended gas kinematic maps of the Perseus cluster by combining five new XRISM/Resolve pointings observed in 2025 with four Performance Verification datasets from 2024, totaling 745 ks net exposure. To date, Perseus remains the only cluster that has been extensively mapped out to ~0.7$r_{2500}$ by XRISM/Resolve, while simultaneously offering sufficient spatial resolution to resolve gaseous substructures driven by mergers and AGN feedback. Our observations cover multiple radial directions and a broad dynamical range, enabling us to characterize the intracluster medium kinematics up to the scale of ~500 kpc. In the measurements, we detect high velocity dispersions ($\simeq$300 km/s) in the eastern region of the cluster, corresponding to a nonthermal pressure fraction of $\simeq$7-13%. The velocity field outside the AGN-dominant region can be effectively described by a single, large-scale kinematic driver based on the velocity structure function, which statistically favors an energy injection scale of at least a few hundred kpc. The estimated turbulent dissipation energy is comparable to the gravitational potential energy released by a recent merger, implying a significant role of turbulent cascade in the merger energy conversion. In the bulk velocity field, we observe a dipole-like pattern along the east-west direction with an amplitude of $\simeq\pm$200-300 km/s, indicating rotational motions induced by the recent merger event. This feature constrains the viewing direction to ~30$^\circ$-50$^\circ$ relative to the normal of the merger plane. Our hydrodynamic simulations suggest that Perseus has experienced at least two energetic mergers since redshift z~1, the latest associated with the radio galaxy IC310. This study showcases exciting scientific opportunities for future missions with high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities (e.g., HUBS, LEM, and NewAthena).</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects includes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the so-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify--for the first time--the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be ~15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to ~50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields --such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom-- that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical relativity (NR) enables the study of physics in strong and dynamical gravitational fields and provides predictions for the gravitational-wave signals produced by merging black holes. Despite the impressive accuracy of modern codes, the resulting waveforms inevitably contain numerical uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties is important, especially for studies probing subdominant or nonlinear effects around the merger and ringdown. This paper describes a flexible Gaussian-process model for the numerical uncertainties in all the spherical-harmonic waveform modes across a state-of-the-art catalog of NR waveforms and a highly efficient procedure for sampling the posteriors of quasinormal mode models without the need for expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo. The Gaussian-process model is used to define a likelihood function which allows many Bayesian data analysis techniques - already widely used in the analysis of experimental gravitational wave data - to be applied to NR waveforms as well. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of quasinormal modes in Cauchy-characteristic evolved waveforms.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Links: From Gaia Neutron Star Binaries to Pulsar White Dwarf Endpoints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of wide, eccentric Gaia neutron stars (NSs) in binaries with still evolving (likely main sequence) companions offers a new probe of mass transfer and pulsar recycling beyond the compact-binary regime. We model their origins and fates using population synthesis with POSYDON and detailed binary evolution with MESA, contrasting two limiting prescriptions at Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF): enforced circularization versus explicitly eccentric mass transfer. Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric, non-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and neutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under optimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only &lt;1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers remain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic populations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling, whereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable mass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington rate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the Eddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer instead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can climb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric channel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild recycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular NS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>New Tests of Low-Scale Quantum Gravity with Cosmic-Ray Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray collisions at high center of mass energy could enable graviton and black hole production as expected in theories of low-scale quantum gravity, such as extra-dimensions, many species, or some versions of string theory. Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M_f \gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M_f \gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M_f \gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Evolution of the March 2022 ICME Revealed by Multi-Point Observations of Forbush Decreases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cause Forbush Decreases (FDs) effects, which are local decreases in background galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.</description>

      <title>The probe limit in MHD and its implications for magnetic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many phenomenological and effective field-theoretical (EFT) applications of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the presence of a background magnetic field employ a simplifying assumption whereby the electromagnetic and the energy-momentum fluctuations decouple. In studies of magnetic transport, for example in magnetic diffusion, the conservation of energy and momentum is then neglected. In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of this so-called $\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD plasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the hydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then explicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT) model of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and their dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition at low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a consequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation symmetry of the state. Finally, we discuss the implications for magnetic transport, with a particular view towards the dynamics of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectral signatures of light r-process elements in kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question regarding neutron star mergers is whether they are able to produce all the r-process elements, from first to third peak. The high abundances of first-peak elements (atomic number $Z \sim 31-40$) in the solar composition means they may dominate the ejecta mass in kilonovae. We here study theoretical infrared signatures of such light elements with spectral synthesis modelling. By combining state-of-the-art NLTE physics with new radiative and collisional data for these elements, we identify several promising diagnostic lines from Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr and Zr. The models give self-consistent line luminosities and indicate specific features that probe emission volumes at early phases ($\sim$10d), the product of ion mass and electron density in late phases ($\gtrsim$75d), and in some cases direct ionic masses at intermediate phases. Emission by [Se I] 5.03 \mum\ + [Se III] 4.55 \mum\ can produce satisfactory fits to the Spitzer photometry of AT2017gfo. However, the models show consistently that with a Kr/Te and Se/Te ratio following the solar r-process pattern, Kr + Se emission is dominant over Te for the blend at 2.1 \mum\ observed in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. The somewhat better line profile fit with [Te III] may suggest that both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi had a strongly sub-solar production of the light r-process elements. An alternative scenario could be that Kr + Se in an asymmetric morphological distribution generates the feature. Further JWST spectral data, in particular covering the so far unobserved $&gt;5$ \mum\ region, holds promise to determine the light r-process production of kilonovae, and in particular whether the light elements are made in a slow disk wind or in a fast proto-NS outflow. We identify specific needs for further atomic data on recombination rates and collision strengths for $Z=31-40$ elements.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Localization of Dark Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Enables Host Galaxy Identification and Precise Cosmological Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lensed gravitational wave (GW) events are expected to be powerful new probes of cosmology, contingent on redshift measurement by electromagnetic observations. Host galaxy identification is thus crucial but challenging due to poor localization by GW signal alone. In this paper, we show that the third-generation ground-based GW detectors will detect a population of lensed events with three or more detectable images (including the central one), each arriving at distinct times and Earth locations in the space, forming an effective network that reduces the typical localization area to $\sim0.01$ deg$^2$. For at least $90\%$ (or $50\%$) of these events, the localization improves by more than a factor of $10$ (or $30$) comparing with unlensed cases. Such precise localization and multiple-image detections enable robust host-galaxy identification and, through lens modelling, further yield sub-arcsecond position. As ``dark lensed sirens", these events become powerful probes of cosmological parameters. Using simulated lensed compact-binary mergers, we show that two-year or longer observations with third-generation GW detectors can measure the Hubble constant to $\lesssim1$\% precision via ``dark lensed sirens" (even when relying solely on lensed stellar-mass binary black hole events), while simultaneously constraining other cosmological parameters. This approach will provide an independent, complementary avenue for measuring cosmological parameters.</description>

Abstract: The Cannon-Ball model of Gamma-Ray Bursts and their afterglows--described in the text and in innumerable previous occasions--is extremely successful and predictive. In a few intrinsically bright GRBs, gamma-rays with energies in the TeV range have been observed. The CB model, I argue, has no difficulty in describing the origin and approximate properties of these high-energy gamma rays and the extreme difficulty of observing their accompanying neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution and the Nature of Long-Lived Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully time-dependent relativistic disk model-based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD-into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We use it fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, from 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs-of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can naturally be explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, like ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their distinction lies in the `viscous' timescale parameter-tied to the disk's angular momentum transport efficiency-which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We argue that existing QPE models may not be able to reproduce the observed connection between the presence (2018) or absence (2014) of eruptions and the disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a challenge for QPE models.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long MeV transient from a relativistic jet: a tidal disruption event candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On July 2, 2025, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope detected three short-duration MeV transients with overlapping sky locations. These events, named as GRB 250702D, B, and E (collectively referred to as DBE), triggered the detector with delays of approximately 1-2 hours between each burst. Follow-up observations of this unusually long MeV transient (lasting &gt;3 hours) by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array over a period of 10 days revealed a steep temporal decline in soft X-rays ($\propto t^{-1.9 \pm 0.1}$). The time-averaged spectra during the outbursts are well described by a single power law $dN_{\gamma}/dE \propto E^{-1.5}$, while upper limits above 100 MeV imply a spectral cutoff between 10 MeV and 100 MeV. Using standard gamma-ray transparency arguments, we derive a lower limit on the bulk Lorentz factor. Combined with the steep decline in X-rays, these constraints point to a relativistic jet origin. The properties of DBE are inconsistent with established GRB spectral-energy correlations, disfavoring classical long GRB progenitors. Instead, the basic characteristics of DBE resemble those of previously reported jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs), though alternative progenitor channels cannot be excluded. In the relativistic TDE scenario, DBE is the first one with detected MeV gamma-ray emission. We argue that the observed emission is most likely produced by synchrotron radiation from sub-TeV electrons.</description>

Abstract: DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the mesoscopic modelling of astrophysical systems via the transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including continuous forces and discrete interactions between particles. This first paper in a series provides an overview of the analytical framework behind the model, consisting of an integral formulation of the relativistic transport equations (Boltzmann equations) and a discretisation procedure for the particle distribution function (Distribution-In-Plateaux). The latter allows for the evaluation of anisotropic interactions, and generates a conservative numerical scheme for a distribution function's transport through phase space.</description>

      <title>The redshift distribution of Einstein Probe transients supports their relation to gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The launch of the \textit{Einstein Probe} unleashed a new era of high-energy transient discovery in the largely unexplored soft X-ray band. The \textit{Einstein Probe} has detected a significant number of fast X-ray transients that display no gamma-ray emission, complicating their robust association to more common gamma-ray bursts. To explore their possible connection, we analyzed the redshift distribution of both \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients and long duration gamma-ray bursts. A comparative analysis of their cumulative redshift distributions using non-parametric two-sample tests, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests, finds no statistically significant difference. These tests favor that their redshifts are drawn from the same underlying distribution. This empirical connection between \textit{Einstein Probe} transients and long gamma-ray bursts is further supported by their agreement with the so-called ``Amati relation'' between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic-equivalent energy. Together, these results indicate that most extragalactic \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients are closely related to long gamma-ray bursts and originate from a massive star (collapsar) progenitor channel. Our findings highlight the role of the \textit{Einstein Probe} in uncovering the missing population of failed jets and dirty fireballs that emit primarily at soft X-ray wavelengths.</description>

      <title>1FLAT: a Firmamento-based catalog of AGN in Fermi-LAT high Galactic latitude {\gamma}-ray sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic reassessment of 5,062 high-Galactic latitude gamma-ray sources from the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog using Firmamento, a web-based platform for multi-frequency source discovery and analysis. Our goal is to provide an independent evaluation of LAT gamma-ray source associations through alternative spectral and spatial methods that combine recent and legacy survey data, supplemented by human supervision of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), source morphology, flux variability, and template-based comparisons. Firmamento confirms the 4FGL-DR4 and 4LAC-DR3 counterparts or unassociated sources in 4,493 cases (88.8%), demonstrating the robustness of both approaches. Beyond this general agreement, we identify 421 new blazar counterparts among previously unassociated sources, thereby reducing the fraction of unidentified extragalactic Fermi-LAT sources from 25% to 17%. In addition, in 64 cases we find alternative blazar associations, while in 49 instances we do not confirm the 4FGL-DR4 association. For all confirmed blazar counterparts we provide homogeneous estimates of synchrotron peak frequency and peak flux using machine-learning and template-based methods; these agree with 4LAC-DR3 values in most cases, though significant discrepancies appear for a few dozen sources, often due to improved X-ray coverage. The primary outcome of this work is the 1st Firmamento LAT AGN table (1FLAT), made publicly available through the Firmamento platform (https://firmamento.nyuad.nyu.edu), where all related multi-wavelength data and images are available. The project involved extensive manual validation and benefited from the active participation of graduate and undergraduate students, highlighting the platform's value for both research and education.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectroscopy of SN Ia 2022aaiq and 2024gy: Evidence for Enhanced Central Stable Ni Abundance and a Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical + near-infrared (NIR) + mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the normal Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) 2022aaiq and 2024gy in the nebular phase, continuously spanning 0.35-28 microns. Medium-resolution JWST spectroscopy reveals novel narrow ($v_{\mathrm{FWHM}}&lt;1500$ km s$^{-1}$) [Ni II] 1.94 and 6.64 micron cores in both events. The MIR [Ni II] 6.64 micron line exhibits a distinct narrow core atop a broader base, indicating a central enhancement of stable Ni. This structure points to high central densities consistent with a near-Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{Ch}$) progenitor or a high-metallicity sub-$M_{Ch}$ progenitor. From detailed line-profile inversions of SN 2024gy, we derive emissivity profiles for stable iron-group elements (IGEs), radioactive material, and intermediate-mass elements (IMEs), revealing spatially distinct ejecta zones. The [Ni III] 7.35 micron line shows a shallow-to-steep slope transition -- a "broken-slope" morphology -- that matches predictions for delayed detonation explosions with separated deflagration and detonation ashes. We also reanalyze and compare to archival JWST spectra of SN 2021aefx and the subluminous SN 2022xkq. We estimate a stable $^{58}$Ni mass of $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$ for SN 2024gy, consistent with delayed detonation models, and $\sim0.01$ M$_\odot$ for SN 2022xkq, favoring sub-$M_{Ch}$ scenarios. These results demonstrate that resolved line profiles, now accessible with JWST, provide powerful diagnostics of explosion geometry, central density, and progenitor mass in SN Ia.</description>

      <title>Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes</title>

Abstract: Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM). Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH contribution to the DM density by non-detection of their Hawking radiation's effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of DM as PBHs with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g, separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization sources on the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1\% of the total DM. We find that these constraints are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Accelerated inference of binary black-hole populations from the stochastic gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to observe $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ of overlapping signals per year from a multitude of astrophysical sources that will be computationally challenging to resolve individually. On the other hand, the stochastic background resulting from the entire population of sources encodes information about the underlying population, allowing for population parameter inference independent and complementary to that obtained with individually resolved events. Parameter estimation in this case is still computationally challenging, as computing the power spectrum involves sampling $\sim 10^5$ sources for each set of hyperparameters describing the binary population. In this work, we build on recently developed importance sampling techniques to compute the SGWB efficiently and train neural networks to interpolate the resulting background. We show that a multi-layer perceptron can encode the model information, allowing for significantly faster inference. We test the network assuming an observing setup with CE and ET sensitivities, where for the first time we include the intrinsic variance of the SGWB in the inference, as in this setup it presents a dominant source of measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from airplanes as observed with RNO-G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes how intentional and unintentional radio emission from airplanes is recorded with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G). We characterize the received signals and define a procedure to extract a clean set of impulsive signals. These signals are highly suitable for instrument calibration, also for future experiments. A set of signals is used to probe the timing precision of RNO-G in-situ, which is found to match expectations. We also discuss the impact of these signals on the ability to detect neutrinos with RNO-G.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short--period ($P&lt;$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($&gt;$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the equilibrium tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, so-called Type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Small Progenitors, Large Couplings: Type Ic Supernova Constraints on Radiatively Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A is a celebrated laboratory in searches for gamma-ray flashes produced by the radiative decay of sub-GeV particles such as axion-like particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and novel gauge bosons. At large couplings, however, particles decay rapidly inside the stellar envelope, which results in a suppression of the signal. Focusing on the prototypical example of ALPs with a photon coupling, we show that core-collapse SNe of Type Ic are much less affected by this attenuation, thanks to the compactness of their progenitors ensuing from the loss of their envelope. While Fermi-LAT may miss the brief gamma-ray flash from a single Type Ic SN, their high rate allows for a statistical approach: by stacking many events, we can obtain constraints that significantly surpass those from SN 1987A at large couplings. Our approach can be extended to any feebly interacting particle featuring a decay channel into photons.</description>

      <title>Splitting the Gravitational Atom: Instabilities of Black Holes with Synchronized/Resonant Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm, linking superradiance from ultralight fields -- creating gravitational atoms -- to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ''very hairy'' regime, where a small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.</description>

      <title>GW250114 reveals black hole horizon signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The horizon of a black hole, the "surface of no return," is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a "direct wave" component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.</description>
