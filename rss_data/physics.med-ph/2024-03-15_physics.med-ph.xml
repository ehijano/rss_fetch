      <title>Doppler holography for ophthalmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive assessment of retinal health demands reliable and precise methods to measure localized blood perfusion. Despite considerable advancements in imaging techniques, such as indocyanine green and fluorescein angiography, along with optical coherence tomography angiography, their capacity to monitor blood flow dynamics across the cardiac cycle faces significant limitations. For more effective care of those with ocular conditions, innovating new approaches is paramount. Doppler holography, an emerging non-invasive optical imaging technique, meets this challenge by offering high temporal resolution imaging of retinal and choroidal blood flow. Now a burgeoning interdisciplinary research field, Doppler holography intertwines functional optical imaging system design, high-performance computing, and clinical investigation. Through collaborative efforts among universities, industry partners, and ophthalmic clinics, a network for its advancement and application is taking shape. This endeavor promises to propel the discovery of novel functional biomarkers, transforming the diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases, refining disease severity categorization, and enhancing therapeutic monitoring-ultimately leading to improved healthcare outcomes.</description>

      <title>Virtual birefringence imaging and histological staining of amyloid deposits in label-free tissue using autofluorescence microscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systemic amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of misfolded proteins in various organs and tissues, leading to progressive organ dysfunction and failure. Congo red stain is the gold standard chemical stain for the visualization of amyloid deposits in tissue sections, as it forms complexes with the misfolded proteins and shows a birefringence pattern under polarized light microscopy. However, Congo red staining is tedious and costly to perform, and prone to false diagnoses due to variations in the amount of amyloid, staining quality and expert interpretation through manual examination of tissue under a polarization microscope. Here, we report the first demonstration of virtual birefringence imaging and virtual Congo red staining of label-free human tissue to show that a single trained neural network can rapidly transform autofluorescence images of label-free tissue sections into brightfield and polarized light microscopy equivalent images, matching the histochemically stained versions of the same samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with blind testing and pathologist evaluations on cardiac tissue where the virtually stained images agreed well with the histochemically stained ground truth images. Our virtually stained polarization and brightfield images highlight amyloid birefringence patterns in a consistent, reproducible manner while mitigating diagnostic challenges due to variations in the quality of chemical staining and manual imaging processes as part of the clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Polarimetric Properties in Various Brain Tumor Types Using Wide-Field Imaging Mueller Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-oncological surgery is the primary brain cancer treatment, yet it faces challenges with gliomas due to their invasiveness and the need to preserve neurological function. Hence, radical resection is often unfeasible, highlighting the importance of precise tumor margin delineation to prevent neurological deficits and improve prognosis. Imaging Mueller polarimetry, an effective modality in various organ tissues, seems a promising approach for tumor delineation in neurosurgery. To further assess its use, we characterized the polarimetric properties by analysing 45 polarimetric measurements of 27 fresh brain tumor samples, including different tumor types with a strong focus on gliomas. Our study integrates a wide-field imaging Mueller polarimetric system and a novel neuropathology protocol, correlating polarimetric and histological data for accurate tissue identification. An image processing pipeline facilitated the alignment and overlay of polarimetric images and histological masks. Variations in depolarization values were observed for grey and white matter of brain tumor tissue, while differences in linear retardance were seen only within white matter of brain tumor tissue. Notably, we identified pronounced optical axis azimuth randomization within tumor regions. This study lays the foundation for machine learning-based brain tumor segmentation algorithms using polarimetric data, facilitating intraoperative diagnosis and decision making.</description>

      <title>Hyperelasticity of Blood Clots: Bridging the Gap between Microscopic and Continuum Scales</title>

Abstract: The biomechanical properties of blood clots, which are dictated by their compositions and micro-structures, play a critical role in determining their fates, occlusion, persistency, or embolization in the human circulatory system. While numerous constitutive models have emerged to describe the biomechanics of blood clots, the majority of these models have primarily focused on the macroscopic deformation of the clots and the resultant strain-stress correlations without depicting the microscopic contributions from their structural components, such as fibrin fibers, fibrin network and red blood cells. This work addresses the gap in current scientific understanding by quantifying how changes in the microstructure of blood clots affect its mechanical responses under different external stresses. We leverage our previous published work to develop a hyperelastic potential model for blood clots, which incorporates six distinct strain-energy components to describe the alignment of fibers, the entropic and enthalpic stretching of fibrin fibers, the buckling of these fibers, clot densification, and clot jamming.These strain-energy components are represented by a combination of simple harmonic oscillators, one-sided harmonic potentials, and a Gaussian potential. The proposed model, which is C0, C1, and C2 continuous with a total of 13 parameters, has been validated against three data sets: fibrin clot in tension, blood clot in compression, and blood clots in shear, demonstrating its robustness. Subsequent simulations of a microscopic blood clot model are performed to uncover mechanistic correlations for a majority of the hyperelastic potential's stiffness/strain parameters. Our results show that only one proposed term concerning fiber buckling needs further refinement, while the remaining five strain-energy terms appear to describe precisely what they were intended to.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on physics-based one-dimensional modeling of lung physiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need to understand how infection spreads to the deep lung was acutely realized during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The challenge of modeling virus laden aerosol transport and deposition in the airways, coupled with mucus clearance, and infection kinetics, became evident. This perspective provides a consolidated view of coupled one-dimensional physics-based mathematical models to probe multifaceted aspects of lung physiology. Successes of 1D trumpet models in providing mechanistic insights into lung function and optimalities are reviewed while identifying limitations and future directions. Key non-dimensional numbers defining lung function are reported. The need to quantitatively map various pathologies on a physics-based parameter space of non-dimensional numbers (a virtual disease landscape) is noted with an eye on translating modeling to clinical practice. This could aid in disease diagnosis, get mechanistic insights into pathologies, and determine patient specific treatment plan. 1D modeling could be an important tool in developing novel measurement and analysis platforms that could be deployed at point-of-care.</description>

      <title>A hollow-core fiber based stand-alone multimodal (2-photon, 3-photon, SHG, THG) nonlinear flexible imaging endoscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal nonlinear endoscopes have been a topic of intense research over the past two decades, enabling sub-cellular and label-free imaging in areas not reachable with table-top microscopes. They are sophisticated systems that can be implemented on an optical table in a lab environment, but they cannot be easily moved within or out of the lab. We present here a multimodal and flexible nonlinear endoscope system able to perform two photon excited fluorescence and second harmonic generation imaging with a stand-alone and moveable kart integrating a compact ultrashort laser source. In addition, the system can perform three photon excited fluorescence and third harmonic generation thanks to a delivery optical fiber used to deliver ultrashort pulses from massive and not movable laser systems into the stand-alone kart. The endoscopic fiber probes and delivery optical fibers are based on functionalized negative curvature hollow core fibers. The endoscope distal head has a diameter &lt;2.2mm and can perform nonlinear imaging at max 10 frames/s over a field of view up to 600 $\mu$m with a ~1 $\mu$m spatial resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light yield and decay constant of BGO were measured at both dry ice and liquid nitrogen temperatures using two SiPMs directly coupled to a $6\times6\times6$ cm$^2$ cubic BGO crystal. With the measured light yield (5.2$\pm$0.3 PE/keV at dry ice temperature and 10.5$\pm$0.4 PE/keV at liquid nitrogen temperature) and decay constants, potential applications of BGO in ToF-PET and SPECT were discussed.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Proposal for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative nitrogen-targeted proton carbon alpha therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and alpha particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. The effectiveness of Proton-CAT was validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the study focused on the relative energy deposition distribution. The findings indicate that the presence of nitrogen enhances the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more severe damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions demonstrated that Proton-CAT significantly increases the efficiency of carbon-12 and alpha particle production. Furthermore, our results revealed that elevating the nitrogen concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and alpha particles within the tumor region. These outcomes offer a novel pathway for proton radiation therapy and hold promise for contributing to the future development of proton therapy.</description>
