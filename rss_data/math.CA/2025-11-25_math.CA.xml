      <title>Non-homogeneous Linear Set-Valued Differential Equations with Variable Matrix Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the initial value problems for non-homogeneous linear differential equations whose solutions are set-valued maps taking values in the space of nonempty compact convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denoted by $K_{c}(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The differential formulation is based on the generalized derivative that includes the Hukuhara derivative, as well as its extensions, Bede-Gal (BG), and Plotnikov-Skripnik (PS) derivatives, and we obtain some general as well as constructive formulas for the solutions. Several illustrative examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Weighted graphs in the sense of John and a global Poincar\'e inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a condition on weighted graphs with finite measure that guarantees the validity of a global Poincar\'e inequality. This condition can be viewed as a discrete analogue of the criterion introduced by J. Boman in 1982 for Whitney cubes, which in turn characterizes the condition originally proposed by F. John in his seminal 1961 work.</description>

      <title>Powers of the arcsine and infinite classes of series involving central binomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general integral expression to transform power series is applied to $\arcsin{x}$ and its positive integer powers. We concentrate on the first to the fourth powers and obtain infinite classes of new power series involving central binomial coefficients. Specializing the variable to appropriate simple values leads to different classes of series expansions for $\pi$ and some of its positive integer powers. We also discuss several limit expressions and connections with hypergeometric series.</description>

      <title>Densitometria I. Discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An upper mean here is a subadditive functional $\overline M$ defined on bounded functions on a commutative group which has, beside some natural requirements, the property we call restricted additivity: if $g(x)= f(x)+f(x+t)$, then $\overline{M} (g)= 2 \overline{M} (f)$. This tries to grasp that it should not depend on local properties. This naturally induces a lower mean, and when they coincide it is the mean. Restriction to 0--1 valued functions (sets) is a density.
  We answer the following questions:
  Given a functional defined on a subset of all functions, when is it a mean?
  Given a functional, which is a mean, how do we find the upper mean it came from? Is it unique?
  Given a function $f$, what are the possible values of $\overline M(f)$, for upper means $\overline M$?
  In particular, we find the extremal means and give several expressions for it. We propose the names ``lowest and uppermost mean'' for them to replace the not really justified names ``lower and upper Banach mean and density''.
  We also consider analogous questions for densities, with partial answers only.</description>

      <title>Quantitative BMO-BLO Estimates for the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study a quantitative extension of the John-Nirenberg inequality for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function of a $\operatorname{BMO}$ function. More precisely, for every nonconstant locally integrable function $f$ such that $Mf$ is not identically infinite, we prove the inequality \begin{equation*}
  \left( \frac{1}{w(Q)}\int_Q \left( \frac{Mf(x) - \operatorname{ess\,inf}_{Q} Mf }{M^\# f(x)} \right)^p w(x)\,dx\right)^\frac{1}{p} \le c_n \, [w]_{A_\infty}\, p \end{equation*} for every cube $Q$, every $1\le p&lt;\infty$ and every weight $w\in A_\infty$, where $[w]_{A_\infty}$ denotes the Fujii-Wilson $A_\infty$ constant. This result extends the classical boundedness $\|Mf\|_{\operatorname{BLO}}\le C_n\|f\|_{\operatorname{BMO}}$ proved by Bennett, DeVore, and Sharpley (Ann. of Math. (2) 113 (1981)) and by Bennett (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 85 (1982)). Furthermore, we show that the class $A_\infty$ is both necessary and sufficient for this inequality to hold, providing a new characterization of $A_\infty$ in terms of the action of the maximal operator on bounded oscillation spaces.</description>

      <title>Growth Estimates for Solutions to the Wave Equation on Damek--Ricci Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the left-invariant distinguished Laplacian, and let $\mathrm{d}\rho$ denote the right Haar measure on a Damek--Ricci space $S$. Let $u(t,x)$ denote the solution to the wave equation $\partial_t^2 u-\mathcal{L} u=0$ with initial data $(u,\partial_t u)|_{t=0}=(f,g)$. In this paper, we establish the sharp-in-regularity $L^p$ bounds \begin{align*} \|u(t,\cdot)\|_{L^p(S ,\mathrm{d}\rho)} \lesssim_p (1+|t|)^{2|\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{2}|}\|(\mathrm{Id}+\mathcal{L})^{\frac{\alpha_0}{2}}\!f\|_{L^p(S ,\mathrm{d}\rho)}+(1+|t|)\,\|(\mathrm{Id}+\mathcal{L})^{\frac{\alpha_1}{2}}\!g\|_{L^p(S,\mathrm{d}\rho)} \end{align*} for all $t\in\mathbb{R}^*$ and $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, where the exponents $\alpha_0 = n\left|1/p-1/2\right|$ and $\alpha_1 = n\left|1/p-1/2\right| -1$ attain their critical values. This result settles, in full generality, the conjecture raised by M\"{u}ller, Thiele, and Vallarino.</description>

      <title>Physical measures for asymptotically sectional expanding flows in higher co-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of physical/SRB measures for asymptotically sectionally hyperbolic attracting sets with any finite co-dimension, extending the co-dimension two case.
  We provide examples of such attractors, either with non-sectional hyperbolic equilibria, or with sectional-hyperbolic equilibria of mixed type, i.e., with a Lorenz-like singularity together with a Rovella-like singularity in a transitive set. These are higher-dimensional versions of contracting Lorenz-like attractors (also known as Rovella-like attractors) to which we apply our criteria to obtain a physical/SRB measure with full ergodic basin.
  We also adapt the previous examples to obtain higher co-dimensional non-uniformly sectional expanding attractors; and also asymptotical $p$-sectional hyperbolic attractors which are \emph{not} non-uniformly $(p-1)$-expanding, for any finite $p&gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new class of Fourier integral operators defined in R^N. Their symbols are allowed to satisfy a differential inequality with certain multi-parameter characteristic. We prove these operators of order -(N-1)/2
  bounded from the classical, atom decomposable H^1-Hardy space to L^1(R^N). As a result, we obtain a sharp L^p-estimate.
  Simultaneously, a generalized Sobolev Lp-space is introduced. We establish the Sobolev Lp-norm inequality for convolutions with a distribution having singularity on the unit sphere. As an application, we give a new a priori estimate for the solution of wave equations by requiring less regularity on the source term and initial data.</description>

      <title>Directional polynomial wavelets on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we construct discrete tight frames for $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, $d\geq3$, which consist of localized polynomial wavelets with adjustable degrees of directionality. In contrast to the well studied isotropic case, these systems are well suited for the direction sensitive analysis of anisotropic features such as edges. The price paid for this is the fact that at each scale the wavelet transform lives on the rotation group $SO(d)$, and not on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ as in the zonal setting. Thus, the standard approach of building discrete frames by sampling the continuous wavelet transform requires a significantly larger amount of sample points. However, by keeping the directionality limited, this number can be greatly reduced to the point where it is comparable to the number of samples needed in the isotropic case. Moreover, the limited directionality is reflected in the wavelets being steerable and their great localization in space leads to a fast convergence of the wavelet expansion in the spaces $L^p(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, $1\leq p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>Frostman random variables, entropy inequalities, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Frostman conditions for bivariate random variables and study discretized entropy sum-product phenomena in both independent and dependent settings. Fix $0 &lt; s &lt; 1$, and let $(X,Y)$ be a bivariate real random variable with bounded support, whose distribution satisfies a Frostman condition of dimension $s$. Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a polynomial obtained from a diagonal polynomial $\rho_1(x)+\rho_2(y)\in \mathbb{R}[x, y]$ of degree $d\ge 2$ by applying an invertible rational linear change of variables in $(x,y)$. We show that there exists $\epsilon = \epsilon(\phi,s)&gt;0$ such that $$ \max\{H_n(X+Y), H_n(\phi(X,Y))\} \geq n(s+\epsilon) $$ for all sufficiently large $n$, where the precise assumptions on $(X,Y)$ depend on the Frostman level. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case.
  As an application, we obtain discretized sum-product type estimates. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subseteq [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying certain non-concentration conditions, and a dense subset $G\subseteq A\times A$, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$ E_\delta(A+_GA) + E_\delta(\phi_G(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here $E_\delta(A)$ denotes the $\delta$-covering number of $A$, $A+_GA:=\{x+y\colon (x, y)\in G\}$, and $\phi_G(A,A):=\{\phi(x, y)\colon (x, y)\in G\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that for every continuous real-valued function $f$ on the circle $\mathbb T=\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z$ there exists a change of variable, i.e., a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$, such that the superposition $f\circ h$ is in the Sobolev space $W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. The main result of the present work is as follows: there does not exist a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$ such that $f\circ h\in W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ for every $f\in C^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. Here $C^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ is the space of all functions on $\mathbb T$ satisfying the Lipschitz condition of order $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Bourgain's condition, sticky Kakeya, and new examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in all dimensions at least 3 and for any H\"ormander-type oscillatory integral operator satisfying Bourgain's condition, the sticky case of the corresponding curved Kakeya conjecture reduces to the sticky case of the classical Kakeya conjecture. This supports a conjecture of Guo-Wang-Zhang, that an operator satisfies the same $L^p$ bounds as in the restriction conjecture exactly when it satisfies Bourgain's condition.
  Our result follows from a new geometric characterization of Bourgain's condition based on the structure of curved $\delta$-tubes in a $\delta^{1/2}$-tube. We find examples in all dimensions at least 3 which show this property does not persist in a larger tube, and in particular these are the first operators satisfying Bourgain's condition for which there is no diffeomorphism taking the corresponding families of curves to lines. This suggests that a general to sticky reduction in the spirit of Wang-Zahl needs substantial new ideas. We expect these examples to provide a good starting point.</description>

Abstract: Gabor phase retrieval stands for recovering a square integrable function up to a global phase from absolute values of its Gabor transform. In this paper, we study Gabor phase retrieval from discrete samples. We consider three types of sampling sequences, which include square root lattices, square root sequences on two intersecting lines and on three parallel lines respectively. In all cases we give the optimal sampling density for a sequence to do Gabor phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.
  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We prove Witten zeta function of a root system $\Phi$ has high-order vanishing at negative even integers, using an integral representation involving the Hurwitz zeta function. This settles a conjecture of Kurokawa and Ochiai for a large class of compact Lie groups. We also provide a qualitative description of the corresponding leading coefficient in terms of Riemann zeta values, in which the highest root of $\Phi$ makes a natural appearance.</description>

      <title>A simple description of blow-up solutions through dynamics at infinity in nonautonomous ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple criterion of the existence of (type-I) blow-up solutions for nonautonomous ODEs is provided. In a previous study [Matsue, SIADS, 24(2025), 415-456], geometric criteria for characterizing blow-up solutions for nonautonomous ODEs are provided by means of dynamics at infinity. The basic idea towards the present aim is to correspond such criteria to leading-term equations associated with blow-up ansatz characterizing multiple-order asymptotic expansions, which originated from the corresponding study developed in the framework of autonomous ODEs. Restricting our attention to constant coefficients of leading terms of blow-ups, results involving the simple criterion of blow-up characterizations in autonomous ODEs can be mimicked to nonautonomous ODEs.</description>

      <title>Fourier Dimension at $C^{1+\alpha}$ Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove power Fourier decay for equilibrium states of nonlinear $C^{1+\alpha}$ iterated function systems, giving first examples of truly $C^{1+\alpha}$ IFSs with attractors of positive Fourier dimension that are not conjugated to a linear IFS previously out of reach of existing techniques. The key new ingredient is a Measure Non-Linearity (MNL) criterion tailored to $C^{1+\alpha}$ IFSs, coupling oscillations in geometric and symbolic directions and allowing us to prove the necessary multiscale non-linearity condition for Fourier decay via an induction-on-scales scheme. This bypasses the classical obstructions that require either large dimension enabling stationary phase comparisons (Kaufman measures), or smoothness or cohomological conditions on the roof function $\tau$ such as $\tau \in C^1$ (Dolgopyat's method), $\tau \in C^\alpha$ but with smooth underlying dynamics (Tsujii--Zhang strategy), or non-flat $C^\alpha$ conjugacy to a constant (fractal van der Corput lemma). The method also applies to parabolic systems including limit sets of geometrically finite groups, Manneville-Pommeau maps, and Lorenz-type maps.</description>

      <title>On quantum large sieve inequalities and operator recovery from incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain large sieve type inequalities for the Rayleigh quotient of the restriction of phase space representations of higher rank operators, via an operator analogue of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The resulting bounds are referred to as `quantum large sieve inequalities'. On the shoulders of Donoho and Stark, we demonstrate that these inequalities guarantee the recovery of an operator whose phase-space information is missing or unobservable over a 'measure-sparse' region $\Omega $, by solving an $L^{1}$-minimization program. This is an operator version of what is commonly known as `Logan's phenomenon'. Moreover, our results can be viewed as a deterministic, continuous variable version, on phase space, of `low-rank' matrix recovery, which itself can be regarded as an operator version of (finite-rank) compressive sensing. Our results depend on an abstract large sieve principle for operators with integrable STFT and on a non-commutative analogue of the local reproducing formula in rotationally invariant domains (first stated by Seip for the Fock space of entire functions). As an application, we obtain concentration estimates for Cohen's class distributions and the Husimi function. We motivate the paper by comparing with Nicola and Tilli's Faber-Krahn inequality for the STFT, illustrating that norm bounds on a domain $\Omega $, obtained by large sieve methods, introduce a trade-off between sparsity and concentration properties of $\Omega $: If $\Omega $ is sparse, the large sieve bound may significantly improve known operator norm bounds, while if $\Omega $ is concentrated, it produces worse bounds.</description>
