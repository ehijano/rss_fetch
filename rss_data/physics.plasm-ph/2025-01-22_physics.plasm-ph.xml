      <title>Exact Stark analytical function for H{\alpha} line based on the FFM Model related with plasma parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Emission Spectroscopy is a widely used technique for plasma diagnosis, with particular interest in hydrogen atomic emission due to its prevalence in plasmas. However, accurately determining plasma parameters like electron density, electron temperature, and gas temperature starting from the experimental profiles remains a challenge. This paper introduces a comprehensive model for Stark broadening of the H{\alpha} line in a wide range of plasma conditions, addressing the limitations of existing analytical expressions for line shapes. The proposed model encompasses the full splitting of the transition into fifteen Lorentzian profiles and electric micro-field fluctuations surrounding the emitting atoms due to collisions with charged particles. Starting from accurate spectral data obtained from realistic computer simulations, fitting parameters of the model, have been obtained by using an optimization method based on a genetic algorithm. The set of parameters of the model are reported for a wide range of plasma conditions. The behavior of these parameters is analyzed to understand their dependence in terms of the electron density and temperature and gas density of the plasma. The model parameters here obtained constitute a useful tool in plasma diagnosis to obtaining the values of the physical parameters of the plasma starting from the experimental profiles.</description>

      <title>A Grad-Shafranov model for compact quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) valid for compact quasisymmetric stellarators is derived by an asymptotic expansion around a vacuum field carried to first order. We obtain an equation for the existence of flux surfaces leading up to the GSE. The flux surface label must simultaneously satisfy the existence equation and the GSE, which generally leads to an overdetermined problem. We show how the overdetermined problem can be resolved within our model for a class of hybrid devices similar to that studied by Henneberg and Plunk (S. Henneberg and G. Plunk, PRR 2024). We are also able to solve the existence equation for flux surfaces analytically in the most general case by introducing a special coordinate system. In future work, we plan to carry out an optimization seeking to minimize the error in our GSE while obeying the flux surface existence equation. This should be faster than a conventional stellarator optimization and will allow us to find solutions outside the class of hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional boundary turbulence simulations of a RFX-mod plasma in the presence of voltage biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional turbulence simulations of a RFX-mod diverted plasma are performed in the presence of a biasing electrode. The simulations show a strong suppression of turbulent transport caused by the induced $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow shear, which leads to the formation of an edge transport barrier with a pedestal-like structure, in qualitative agreement with RFX-mod experiments. The strong $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow shear turbulence suppression with edge voltage biasing is also observed in the proximity of the density limit crossing, suggesting that edge voltage biasing may allow for larger maximum achievable density values. By leveraging the simulation results, the theoretical scaling law of the edge pressure gradient length derived in Giacomin &amp; Ricci (2020) J. Plasma Phys. 86(5) is extended here to account for the $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow shear turbulence suppression caused by voltage biasing. The improved theoretical scaling with typical RFX-mod shearing rate values predicts a factor of two increase of the pressure gradient at the separatrix, which is comparable to RFX-mod experiments in the presence of voltage biasing. The implications of the flow shear turbulence suppression due to voltage biasing on the density limit in RFX-mod are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Strong-field ionization in particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the inclusion of the process of multiple ionization of atoms in high-intensity electromagnetic fields into particle-in-cell (PIC) codes applied to the simulation of laser-plasma interactions. The approach is based on the application of the Perelomov-Popov-Terent'yev formulas for ionization rates within the paradigm of sequential tunnel ionization. We analyze difficulties and possible inconsistencies of the approach, which may cause problems in the implementation of PIC codes. To test the sensitivity to the ionization model variations, we perform simulations of an argon target ionization by an incident high-intensity laser pulse. For this, we implement an original procedure in PIC code SMILEI, which allows us to account for the dependence on the magnetic quantum number in ionization rates consistently, and also include barrier suppression at high fields.</description>

      <title>The gyrokinetic field invariant and electromagnetic temperature-gradient instabilities in `good-curvature' plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvature-driven instabilities are ubiquitous in magnetised fusion plasmas. By analysing the conservation laws of the gyrokinetic system of equations, we demonstrate that the well-known spatial localisation of these instabilities to regions of `bad magnetic curvature' can be explained using the conservation law for a sign-indefinite quadratic quantity that we call the `gyrokinetic field invariant'. Its evolution equation allows us to define the local effective magnetic curvature whose sign demarcates the regions of `good' and `bad' curvature, which, under some additional simplifying assumptions, can be shown to correspond to the inboard (high-field) and outboard (low-field) sides of a tokamak plasma, respectively. We find that, given some reasonable assumptions, electrostatic curvature-driven modes are always localised to the regions of bad magnetic curvature, regardless of the specific character of the instability. More importantly, we also deduce that any mode that is unstable in the region of good magnetic curvature must be electromagnetic in nature. As a concrete example, we present the magnetic-drift mode, a novel good-curvature electromagnetic instability, and compare its properties with the well-known electron-temperature-gradient instability. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the magnetic-drift mode for high-$\beta$ fusion plasmas, and in particular its relationship with microtearing modes.</description>

      <title>Transversely pumped laser driven particle accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new acceleration scheme capable of accelerating electrons and ions in an underdense plasma. Transversely Pumped Acceleration (TPA) uses multiple arrays of counter-propagating laser beamlets that focus onto a central acceleration axis. Tuning the injection timing and the spacing between the adjacent beamlets allows for precise control over the position and velocity of the intersection point of the counter-propagating beam arrays, resulting in an accelerating structure that propagates orthogonal to the direction of laser propagation. We present the theory that sets the injection timing of the incoming pulses to accelerate electrons and ions with a tunable phase velocity plasma wave. Simulation results are also presented which demonstrate 1.2 GeV proton beams accelerated in 3.6 mm of plasma and electron acceleration gradients on the order of 1 TeV/m in a scheme that circumvents dephasing. This work has potential applications as a compact accelerator for medical physics and high energy physics colliders.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian quantum kinetic simulations of uniform dense plasmas: mitigating the aliasing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense quantum plasmas out of equilibrium are successfully modeled using quantum kinetic equations, such as the quantum Boltzmann, Landau or Balescu-Lenard equation. However, these equations do not properly take into account correlation effects which requires to use generalized non-Markovian kinetic equations. While the latter have been successful for lattice models, applications to continuous systems such as plasmas are severely hampered by aliasing effects. Here we present a strategy how to suppress aliasing and make applications of non-Makrovian quantum kinetic equations to plasmas possible.</description>

      <title>Forward Raman Scattering and Self-Modulation instabilities of lasers in magnetized tapered plasma channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of laser pulses in tapered magnetized plasma channels is analyzed using the fluid theory of cold plasmas. This study focuses on laser propagation's key instabilities: forward Raman scattering and self-modulation instability. The influence of plasma density, laser intensity, dc magnetic field strength, and laser polarization on the growth rates of these instabilities is thoroughly examined. Analytical and numerical computations of the number of e-foldings for forward Raman scattering are performed to quantify its impact. The results reveal that increased plasma density and laser intensity significantly enhance the growth rates of these instabilities, leading to amplified Raman-scattered wave intensity and modulation of the laser envelope. Moreover, the strength of the dc magnetic field plays a pivotal role: it boosts instability growth rates for right-handed circularly polarized laser pulses while suppressing them for left-handed circularly polarized pulses. These findings highlight that reducing the growth rates of instabilities can facilitate the stable propagation of laser pulses in tapered plasma channels.</description>

      <title>Wakefield-induced THz wave generation in a hybrid dielectric-plasma cylindrical waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, the generation of THz radiation through wakefield excitation in a cylindrical dielectric plasma waveguide is investigated. The proposed hybrid dielectric-plasma wakefield structure combines the advantages of dielectric materials and plasma, creating a versatile platform for high-performance applications and advanced THz radiation generation. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, this hybrid configuration achieves enhanced gradients and optimized THz wave output. The mechanism involves a high-energy laser pulse propagating through a plasma-loaded dielectric waveguide, inducing wakefields that drive THz wave emission. This dual capability underscores the versatility of the proposed structure, offering significant advancements in THz wave generation technologies. To support the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations were employed using the Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) method and the COMSOL Multiphysics package. The simulation modeled the wakefield generation process and validated the propagation of electromagnetic waves. A comprehensive parametric study examined the effects of various parameters including dielectric thickness, an external DC magnetic field, laser pulse length, driver beam radius, and total current, on the wakefield generated THz radiation. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the study aims to elucidate the controlled features of the resulting fields and optimize THz radiation.</description>

      <title>Inverse cascade from helical and nonhelical decaying columnar magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful lasers may in future produce magnetic fields that would allow us to study turbulent magnetohydrodynamic inverse cascade behavior. This has so far only been seen in numerical simulations. In the laboratory, however, the produced fields may be highly anisotropic. Here, we present corresponding simulations to show that, during the turbulent decay, such a magnetic field undergoes spontaneous isotropization. As a consequence, we find the decay dynamics to be similar to that in isotropic turbulence. We also find that an initially pointwise nonhelical magnetic field is unstable and develops magnetic helicity fluctuations that can be quantified by the Hosking integral. It is a conserved quantity that characterizes magnetic helicity fluctuations and governs the turbulent decay when the mean magnetic helicity vanishes. As in earlier work, the ratio of the magnetic decay time to the Alfv\'en time is found to be around $50$ in the helical and nonhelical cases. At intermediate times, the ratio can even reach a hundred. This ratio determines the endpoints of cosmological magnetic field evolution.</description>

      <title>Experiments and modeling of dust particle heating resulting from changes in polarity switching in the PK-4 microgravity laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of gravity, the micron-sized charged dust particles in a complex (dusty) plasma are compressed into thin layers. However, under the microgravity conditions of the Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4) experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), the particles fill the plasma, allowing us to investigate the properties of a three-dimensional (3D) multi-particle system. This paper examines the change in the spatial ordering and thermal state of the particle system created when dust particles are stopped by periodic oscillations of the electric field, known as polarity switching, in a dc glow discharge plasma.
  Data from the ISS is compared against experiments performed using a ground-based reference version of PK-4 and numerical simulations. Initial results show substantive differences in the velocity distribution functions between experiments on the ground and in microgravity. There are also differences in the motion of the dust cloud, in microgravity there is an expansion of the dust cloud at the application of polarity switching which is not seen in the ground-based experiments. It is proposed that the dust cloud in microgravity gains thermal energy at the application of polarity switching due to this expansion. Simulation results suggest that this may be due to a modification in the effective screening length of the dust at the onset of polarity switching, which arises from a configuration energy between the charged particles. Experimental measurements and simulations show that an extended time (much greater than the Epstein drag decay) is required to dissipate this energy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic scaling laws for the stagnation conditions of Z-pinch implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implosions of magnetically-driven annular shells (Z pinches) are studied in the laboratory to produce high-energy-density plasmas. Such plasmas have a wide-range of applications including x-ray generation, controlled thermonuclear fusion, and astrophysics studies. In this work, we theoretically investigate the in-flight dynamics of a magnetically-driven, imploding cylindrical shell that stagnates onto itself upon collision on axis. The converging flow of the Z-pinch is analyzed by considering the implosion trajectory in the $(A, M)$ parametric plane, where $A$ is the in-flight aspect ratio and $M$ is the implosion Mach number. For an ideal implosion in the absence of instabilities and in the limit of $A\gg1$, we derive asymptotic scaling laws for hydrodynamic quantities evaluated at stagnation (e.g., density, temperature, and pressure) and for performance metrics (e.g., soft x-ray emission, K-shell x-ray emission, and neutron yield) as functions of target-design parameters.</description>

      <title>Classical waves and instabilities using the minimalist approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimalist approach in the study of perturbations in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics involves describing their evolution in the linear regime using a single first-order ordinary differential equation, dubbed principal equation. The dispersion relation is determined by requiring that the solution of the principal equation be continuous and satisfy specific boundary conditions for each problem. The formalism is presented for flows in cartesian geometry and applied to classical cases such as the magnetosonic and gravity waves, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. For the latter, we discuss the influence of compressibility and the magnetic field, and also derive analytical expressions for the growth rates and the range of instability in the case of two fluids with the same characteristics.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced plasma formation and cavitation in water: from nanoeffects to extreme states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the energy dependence of optical breakdown in water by tightly focused laser pulses, from plasma formation to shock waves and cavitation. Laser pulses of fs to ns durations and UV to IR wavelengths are aberration-free focused through microscope objectives. Photography captures luminescent plasmas with submicrometer resolution, and bubble threshold and size are determined via probe beam scattering. The energy dependence of mechanical effects is quantified through the maximum bubble radius Rmax. We find three key scenarios depicting the interaction between multiphoton and avalanche ionization, recombination, and thermal ionization from nanoeffects near threshold to extreme energy densities. They include a previously unknown scenario that emerges with single-longitudinal-mode UV ns pulses from compact lasers. It enables cost-effective creation of nanoeffects, as demonstrated on corneal tissue and glass. Plasma photography reveals new insights in the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasma formation, with an interplay of breakdown waves, string formation by local instabilities of avalanche ionization, and radiative energy transport. Plasma volume data from photographs together with absorption measurements show that the average energy density of luminescent fs and ns plasmas is similar, ranging between 10 and 40 kJ/cm^3. However, small hot regions with up to 400 kJ/cm^3 are formed in ns breakdown. From the hot regions, energy is spread out via X-ray bremsstrahlung, forming a luminescent halo. Well above threshold, Rmax scales with EL^1/3 across all scenarios, with 15% - 20% conversion of laser energy into bubble energy. With increasing plasma energy density, an ever-larger energy fraction is converted into shock wave energy (75% at 40 kJ/cm^3). The results provide guidelines for parameter selection in laser surgery and material processing.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the Erice Workshop: A new baseline for the hybrid, asymmetric, linear Higgs factory HALHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The HALHF collaboration has discussed a new baseline for the project, taking into account comments from the accelerator community on various aspects of the original design. In particular, these concerned the practicality of the dual-purpose linac to accelerate both colliding positron bunches and the drive beams required for the plasma linac. In addition, many other aspects of the project were also considered; the discussion and conclusions are documented in this paper. Finally, a new baseline is outlined that has been optimised and addresses several weaknesses in the original design, has higher luminosity, reduced centre-of-mass energy boost and additional features such as positron polarization as well as electron polarization. Although HALHF has become longer and more expensive, it remains significantly smaller and cheaper than other mature Higgs factory designs currently under discussion.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Scale Physics of a Multi-Species Solar Wind</title>

Abstract: The solar wind affects the plasma environment around all solar system bodies. A strong solar wind dynamic pressure pushes plasma boundaries closer to these objects. For small objects kinetic effects on scales smaller than an ion gyroradius play an important role, and species with various mass-per-charge may act differently. In this case the solar wind composition can be important. Protons are the dominant ion species in the solar wind; however, sometimes the density of alpha particles increases significantly. We analyse the effect of different solar wind alpha-to-proton ratios on the plasma boundaries of the induced cometary magnetosphere. In addition, we investigate the energy transfer between the solar wind ions, the cometary ions, and the electromagnetic fields. Using the hybrid model Amitis, we simulate two different alpha-to-proton ratios and analyse the resulting plasma structures. We calculate the power density (E.J) of all three ion species (solar wind protons and alphas, and cometary ions) to identify load and generator regions. The integrated 1D power density shows the evolution of the power density from the upstream solar wind to downstream of the nucleus. A higher alpha-to-proton ratio leads to a larger comet magnetosphere but weaker magnetic field pile-up. The protons transfer energy to the fields and the cometary ions in the entire upstream region and the pile-up layer. Upstream of the nucleus, alphas are inefficient in transferring energy and can act as a load, especially for low alpha-to-proton ratios. The transfer of energy from alphas to cometary ions happens further downstream due to their larger inertia. For a multi-species solar wind the mass loading and energy transfer upstream of the pile-up layer will be most efficient for the species with the lowest inertia, typically protons, since different ion gyroradii give different flow patterns for the individual species.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak dynamo regimes in Taylor-Couette flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. Both the amplitude of initial perturbations and $Pm$ play a critical role in its onset and evolution. It is shown that this dynamo exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, more turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in many astrophysical settings with small $Pm$.</description>

      <title>Tracing magnetic switchbacks to their source: An assessment of solar coronal jets as switchback precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of large-amplitude magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, known as magnetic switchbacks, is still under debate. These structures, which are ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have their seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by magnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or indirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ measurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of small-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether these eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind switchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic back-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the influence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on magnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual approaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find that the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly depending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence on the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two corotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching level of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly rate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However, no correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates. Modeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the investigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring during the solar wind propagation may also influence our results. These results do not allow us to conclude that the jets are the main switchback precursors, nor do they rule out this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Flux-Rope Mediated Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence, applicable when the magnetic helicity is non-zero. The new model differs from the Lazarian-Vishniac turbulent reconnection theory by emphasizing the role of locally coherent magnetic structures, whose existence is shown to be permitted by the properties of magnetic field line separation in turbulent plasma. Local coherence allows storage of magnetic helicity inside the reconnection layer and we argue that helicity conservation produces locally coherent twisted flux ropes. We then introduce the "Alfv\'en horizon" to explain why the global reconnection rate can be governed by locally coherent magnetic field structure instead of by field line wandering, formally extending to 3D the principle that reconnection can be made fast by fragmentation of the global current layer. Coherence is shown to dominate over field line dispersion if the anisotropy of the turbulence at the perpendicular scale matching the thickness of a marginally stable current layer exceeds the aspect ratio of the current layer. Finally, we conjecture that turbulence generated within the reconnection layer may produce a balance of anisotropies that maintains the system in the flux-rope mediated regime. The new model successfully accounts for the major features of 3D numerical simulations of self-generated turbulent reconnection, including reconnection rates of 0.01 in resistive MHD and 0.1 with collisionless physics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of zero-frequency fluctuations generated by coupling between Alfven modes in the JET tokamak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first experimental detection of a zero-frequency fluctuation that is pumped by an Alfv\`en mode in a magnetically confined plasma. Core-localized bidirectional Alfv\`en modes of frequency inside the toroidicity-induced gap (and its harmonics) exhibit three-wave coupling interactions with a zero-frequency fluctuation. The observation of the zero-frequency fluctuation is consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions of zonal modes pumped by Alfv\'en modes, and is correlated with an increase in the deep core ion temperature, temperature gradient, and confinement factor $H_{89,P}$. Despite the energetic particle transport induced by the Alfv\`en eigenmodes, the generation of a zero-frequency fluctuation that can suppress the turbulence leads to an overall improvement of confinement.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection and dynamos in the presence of plasma turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolving magnetic fields are frequently embedded in plasmas that are turbulent. When the primary interest is in effects that are on a large scale compared to that of the turbulence, it is desirable to average over the turbulence to obtain equations for mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. An obvious constraint on the validity of the averaging is that large-scale quantities that evolve slowly using the exact evolution equations must remain slowly evolving in the mean-field theory. Magnetic helicity is the primary example of such a quantity and maintaining its slow evolution has proven difficult in mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. A full theory of magnetic reconnection in turbulent plasmas is not the intent of this paper. What is the intent is to show how exact results from Maxwell's equations explain why fast reconnection is so ubiquitous and what constraints these results place on the theory of magnetic field evolution, including dynamos, whether the plasma is turbulent or not. These constraints are commonly broken in the reconnection literature, which has been heavily influenced by two-dimensional theory that is not applicable to three-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>General relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>

Abstract: A kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM), derived from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation with spherically symmetric velocity space, is introduced as a general relaxation model for homogeneous plasmas. The closed form of this model is presented by introducing a set new functions called $R$ function and $R$ integration. This nonlinear model, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, enables the capture of the nature of the equilibrium state. From this relaxation model, a general temperature relaxation model is derived when velocity space exhibits spherical symmetry, and the general characteristic frequency of temperature relaxation is presented.</description>

      <title>Higher-order moment convergent method in weakly anisotropic plasma and the NLVFP code for solution of the 0D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>

Abstract: Fusion plasma is a typical non-equilibrium and nonlinear system, with the interaction between different species well described by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equations. The transport of mass, momentum, energy, and temperature relaxation are important issues, which are affected by the collision term of VFP even in so-called collision-less plasma domain. Hence, nonlinearity and collisions are crucial features in large regime. A successful numerical simulation for non-equilibrium plasma has to be able to conserve mass, momentum and energy, while to satisfy Boltzmann's H-theorem and higher-order moment convergence. An expansion of the distribution function in spherical harmonics (Legendre basis when the velocity space exhibits axisymmetry) in angle coordinate and in King basis in speed coordinate of velocity space is well suited to address these requirements. This paper reviews the formulation of the 0D-2V VFP equation in terms of spherical harmonics coupled with King function and its solution in our NLVFP code. In this topic review, we will introduce the background physics related to the nonlinear VFP simulation, then describe NLVFP for 0D-2V homogeneous, weakly anisotropic plasma with utilization of the Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPRS) collision operator.</description>

Abstract: Large scale validation and uncertainty quantification are essential in the experimental design, control, and operations of fusion reactors. Reduced models and increasing computational power means that it is possible to run many simulations, yet setting up simulation runs remaining a time-consuming and error-prone process that involves many manual steps. duqtools is an open-source workflow tool written in Python for that addresses this bottleneck by automating the set up of new simulations. This enables uncertainty quantification and large scale validation of fusion energy modelling simulations. In this work, we demonstrate how duqtools can be used to set up and launch 2000 different simulations of plasma experiments to validate aspects of the JINTRAC modelling suite. With this large-scale validation we identified issues in preserving data consistency in model initialization of the current ($I(p)$) distribution. Furthermore, we used duqtools for sensitivity analysis on the QLKNN-jetexp-15D surrogate model to verify its correctness in multiple regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the Spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) coupled with the King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. The characteristic parameter equations (CPEs) are provided based on the King mixture model (KMM), serving as the constraint equations of the transport equations. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM). This model is typically a nonlinear system, effective for moderately anisotropic nonequilibrium plasmas.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the concept of relativity of simultaneity used in the theory of special relativity, a new approach is proposed to simulate future solar wind conditions at any point in the inner solar system. An important distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that the simulation in the solar corona is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms and is continuously simulated in nearly real time. The model for the inner heliosphere is based on time transformation to a boosted frame of reverence (or spacetime coordinate system) in which the current state of the solar wind at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary and future states of the solar wind are simultaneous. The predictive capability for tomorrow's parameters of the ambient solar wind at 1 AU is achieved by simulating them simultaneously with the current observations of the solar magnetic field, the time offset being due to the use of boosted frame.
  We derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics and present a new numerical algorithm that solves the modified governing equations. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation and thus a significantly longer forecast time than traditional solution methods. In the numerical test for transient propagation, the boosted solution for the CME-driven shock arrival at 1AU is 16 hours ahead of the solution at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary.</description>
