      <title>Relationship Analysis of Image-Text Pair in SNS Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networking services (SNS) contain vast amounts of image-text posts, necessitating effective analysis of their relationships for improved information retrieval. This study addresses the classification of image-text pairs in SNS, overcoming prior limitations in distinguishing relationships beyond similarity. We propose a graph-based method to classify image-text pairs into similar and complementary relationships. Our approach first embeds images and text using CLIP, followed by clustering. Next, we construct an Image-Text Relationship Clustering Line Graph (ITRC-Line Graph), where clusters serve as nodes. Finally, edges and nodes are swapped in a pseudo-graph representation. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) then learns node and edge representations, which are fused with the original embeddings for final classification. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>MORALISE: A Structured Benchmark for Moral Alignment in Visual Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images. Reader discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs) using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory, spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text. For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and \textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.</description>

      <title>VisTopics: A Visual Semantic Unsupervised Approach to Topic Modeling of Video and Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding visual narratives is crucial for examining the evolving dynamics of media representation. This study introduces VisTopics, a computational framework designed to analyze large-scale visual datasets through an end-to-end pipeline encompassing frame extraction, deduplication, and semantic clustering. Applying VisTopics to a dataset of 452 NBC News videos resulted in reducing 11,070 frames to 6,928 deduplicated frames, which were then semantically analyzed to uncover 35 topics ranging from political events to environmental crises. By integrating Latent Dirichlet Allocation with caption-based semantic analysis, VisTopics demonstrates its potential to unravel patterns in visual framing across diverse contexts. This approach enables longitudinal studies and cross-platform comparisons, shedding light on the intersection of media, technology, and public discourse. The study validates the method's reliability through human coding accuracy metrics and emphasizes its scalability for communication research. By bridging the gap between visual representation and semantic meaning, VisTopics provides a transformative tool for advancing the methodological toolkit in computational media studies. Future research may leverage VisTopics for comparative analyses across media outlets or geographic regions, offering insights into the shifting landscapes of media narratives and their societal implications.</description>

      <title>Robust Relevance Feedback for Interactive Known-Item Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Known-item search (KIS) involves only a single search target, making relevance feedback-typically a powerful technique for efficiently identifying multiple positive examples to infer user intent-inapplicable. PicHunter addresses this issue by asking users to select the top-k most similar examples to the unique search target from a displayed set. Under ideal conditions, when the user's perception aligns closely with the machine's perception of similarity, consistent and precise judgments can elevate the target to the top position within a few iterations. However, in practical scenarios, expecting users to provide consistent judgments is often unrealistic, especially when the underlying embedding features used for similarity measurements lack interpretability. To enhance robustness, we first introduce a pairwise relative judgment feedback that improves the stability of top-k selections by mitigating the impact of misaligned feedback. Then, we decompose user perception into multiple sub-perceptions, each represented as an independent embedding space. This approach assumes that users may not consistently align with a single representation but are more likely to align with one or several among multiple representations. We develop a predictive user model that estimates the combination of sub-perceptions based on each user feedback instance. The predictive user model is then trained to filter out the misaligned sub-perceptions. Experimental evaluations on the large-scale open-domain dataset V3C indicate that the proposed model can optimize over 60% search targets to the top rank when their initial ranks at the search depth between 10 and 50. Even for targets initially ranked between 1,000 and 5,000, the model achieves a success rate exceeding 40% in optimizing ranks to the top, demonstrating the enhanced robustness of relevance feedback in KIS despite inconsistent feedback.</description>

      <title>Prolonged Reasoning Is Not All You Need: Certainty-Based Adaptive Routing for Efficient LLM/MLLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks. To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Seeing Through Deception: Uncovering Misleading Creator Intent in Multimodal News with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</description>

      <title>CAV-MAE Sync: Improving Contrastive Audio-Visual Mask Autoencoders via Fine-Grained Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-visual learning have shown promising results in learning representations across modalities. However, most approaches rely on global audio representations that fail to capture fine-grained temporal correspondences with visual frames. Additionally, existing methods often struggle with conflicting optimization objectives when trying to jointly learn reconstruction and cross-modal alignment. In this work, we propose CAV-MAE Sync as a simple yet effective extension of the original CAV-MAE framework for self-supervised audio-visual learning. We address three key challenges: First, we tackle the granularity mismatch between modalities by treating audio as a temporal sequence aligned with video frames, rather than using global representations. Second, we resolve conflicting optimization goals by separating contrastive and reconstruction objectives through dedicated global tokens. Third, we improve spatial localization by introducing learnable register tokens that reduce semantic load on patch tokens. We evaluate the proposed approach on AudioSet, VGG Sound, and the ADE20K Sound dataset on zero-shot retrieval, classification and localization tasks demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming more complex architectures.</description>

      <title>Hearing from Silence: Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos via Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can intuitively infer sounds from silent videos, but whether multimodal large language models can perform modal-mismatch reasoning without accessing target modalities remains relatively unexplored. Current text-assisted-video-to-audio (VT2A) methods excel in video foley tasks but struggle to acquire audio descriptions during inference. We introduce the task of Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos (SVAD) to address this challenge and investigate vision-language models' (VLMs) capabilities on this task. To further enhance the VLMs' reasoning capacity for the SVAD task, we construct a CoT-AudioCaps dataset and propose a Chain-of-Thought-based supervised fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on SVAD and subsequent VT2A tasks demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two key aspects: significantly improving VLMs' modal-mismatch reasoning for SVAD and effectively addressing the challenge of acquiring audio descriptions during VT2A inference.</description>

      <title>Unified Microphone Conversion: Many-to-Many Device Mapping via Feature-wise Linear Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Unified Microphone Conversion, a unified generative framework designed to bolster sound event classification (SEC) systems against device variability. While our prior CycleGAN-based methods effectively simulate device characteristics, they require separate models for each device pair, limiting scalability. Our approach overcomes this constraint by conditioning the generator on frequency response data, enabling many-to-many device mappings through unpaired training. We integrate frequency-response information via Feature-wise Linear Modulation, further enhancing scalability. Additionally, incorporating synthetic frequency response differences improves the applicability of our framework for real-world application. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.6% and reduces variability by 0.8% in macro-average F1 score.</description>

      <title>MIRe: Enhancing Multimodal Queries Representation via Fusion-Free Modality Interaction for Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multimodal retrieval methods have endowed text-based retrievers with multimodal capabilities by utilizing pre-training strategies for visual-text alignment. They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting in strong performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our ablation studies and analyses explicitly verify the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating the text-dominant issue.

      <title>SEA: Low-Resource Safety Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models via Synthetic Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have serious security vulnerabilities.While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM's security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning.</description>

      <title>MatchDance: Collaborative Mamba-Transformer Architecture Matching for High-Quality 3D Dance Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music-to-dance generation represents a challenging yet pivotal task at the intersection of choreography, virtual reality, and creative content generation. Despite its significance, existing methods face substantial limitation in achieving choreographic consistency. To address the challenge, we propose MatchDance, a novel framework for music-to-dance generation that constructs a latent representation to enhance choreographic consistency. MatchDance employs a two-stage design: (1) a Kinematic-Dynamic-based Quantization Stage (KDQS), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) with kinematic-dynamic constraints and reconstructs them with high fidelity, and (2) a Hybrid Music-to-Dance Generation Stage(HMDGS), which uses a Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture to map music into the latent representation, followed by the KDQS decoder to generate 3D dance motions. Additionally, a music-dance retrieval framework and comprehensive metrics are introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments on the FineDance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) enhances robustness in noisy environments by integrating visual cues. While recent advances integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into AVSR, their high computational cost hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Llama-SMoP, an efficient Multimodal LLM that employs a Sparse Mixture of Projectors (SMoP) module to scale model capacity without increasing inference costs. By incorporating sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) projectors, Llama-SMoP enables the use of smaller LLMs while maintaining strong performance. We explore three SMoP configurations and show that Llama-SMoP DEDR (Disjoint-Experts, Disjoint-Routers), which uses modality-specific routers and experts, achieves superior performance on ASR, VSR, and AVSR tasks. Ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in expert activation, scalability, and noise robustness.</description>
