      <title>Quantum state tomography on closed timelike curves using weak measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any given prescription of quantum time travel necessarily endows a Hilbert space to the chronology-violating (CV) system on the closed timelike curve (CTC). However, under the two foremost models, Deutsch's prescription (D-CTCs) and postselected teleportation (P-CTCs), the CV system is treated very differently: D-CTCs assign a definite form to the state on this system, while P-CTCs do not. To further explore this distinction, we present a methodology by which an operational notion of state may be assigned to their respective CV systems. This is accomplished via a conjunction of state tomography and weak measurements, with the latter being essential in leaving any notions of self-consistency intact. With this technique, we are able to verify the predictions of D-CTCs and, perhaps more significantly, operationally assign a state to the system on the P-CTC. We show that, for any given combination of chronology-respecting input and unitary interaction, it is always possible to recover the unique state on the P-CTC, and we provide a few specific examples in the context of select archetypal temporal paradoxes. We also demonstrate how this state may be derived from analysis of the P-CTC prescription itself, and we explore how it compares to its counterpart in the CV state predicted by D-CTCs.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of spin superposition state caused by a quantum electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the decoherence of a spatially superposed electrically neutral spin-$\frac12$ particle in the presence of a relativistic quantum electromagnetic field in Minkowski spacetime. We demonstrate that decoherence due to the spin-magnetic field coupling can be categorized into two distinct factors: local decoherence, originating from the two-point correlation functions along each branch of the superposed trajectories, and nonlocal decoherence, which arises from the correlation functions between the two superposed trajectories. These effects are linked to phase damping and amplitude damping. We also show that if the quantum field is prepared in a thermal state, decoherence monotonically increases with the field temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing in an exciton-polariton condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme sensitivity of critical systems has been explored to improve quantum sensing and weak signal detection. The closing of the energy gap and abrupt change in the nature of the ground state at a quantum phase transition (QPT) critical point enhance indicators of parameter estimation, such as the quantum Fischer information. Here, we show that even if the system lacks a QPT, the quantum Fischer information can still be amplified due to the presence of an excited-state quantum phase transition (ESQPT). This is shown for a light-driven anharmonic quantum oscillator model that describes the low-lying spectrum of an exciton-polariton condensate proposed as a platform for quantum computation. In the classical limit, the ESQPT translates into the emergence of a hyperbolic point that explains the clustering of the energy levels at the vicinity of the ESQPT and the changed structure of the corresponding eigenstates, justifying the enhanced sensitivity of the system. Our study showcases the relationship between non-conventional quantum critical phenomena and quantum sensing with potential experimental applications in exciton-polariton systems.</description>

      <title>Gluing together Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Mechanics: a look at the Bell-CHSH inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is revisited by making use of the Hilbert space ${\cal H} \otimes {\cal H}_{AB}$, where ${\cal H}$ and ${\cal H}_{AB}$ stand, respectively, for the Hilbert space of the scalar field and of a generic bipartite quantum mechanical system. The construction of Hermitian, field-dependent, dichotomic operators is devised as well as the Bell-CHSH inequality. Working out the $AB$ part of the inequality, the resulting Bell-CHSH correlation function for the quantum field naturally emerges from unitary Weyl operators. Furthermore, introducing a Jaynes-Cummings type Hamiltonian accounting for the interaction between the scalar field and a pair of qubits, the quantum corrections to the Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of the scalar field are evaluated till the second order in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: Via elementary examples it is demonstrated that the singularities of classical physics (sampled by the Big Bang in cosmology) need not necessarily get smeared out after quantization. It is proposed that the role of quantum singularities can be played by the so called Kato's exceptional-point spectral degeneracies.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Euclidean Similarity Algorithm for Worldwide Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprinting techniques are widely used for localization because of their accuracy, especially in the presence of wireless channel noise. However, the fingerprinting techniques require significant storage and running time, which is a concern when implementing such systems on a global worldwide scale.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum Euclidean similarity algorithm for wireless localization systems. The proposed quantum algorithm offers exponentially improved complexity compared to its classical counterpart and even the state-of-the-art quantum localization systems, in terms of both storage space and running time. The basic idea is to entangle the test received signal strength (RSS) vector with the fingerprint vectors at different locations and perform the similarity calculation in parallel to all fingerprint locations. We give the details of how to construct the quantum fingerprint, how to encode the RSS measurements in quantum particles, and finally; present the quantum algorithm for calculating the Euclidean similarity between the online RSS measurements and the fingerprint ones.
  Implementation and evaluation of our algorithm in a real testbed using a real IBM quantum machine as well as a simulation for a larger testbed confirm its ability to correctly obtain the estimated location with an exponential enhancement in both time and space compared to the traditional classical fingerprinting techniques and the state-of-the-art quantum localization techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Breach: Reusing Training Dataset by Untrusted Quantum Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionize fields like machine learning, security, and healthcare. Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising area, enhancing learning algorithms using quantum computers. However, QML models are lucrative targets due to their high training costs and extensive training times. The scarcity of quantum resources and long wait times further exacerbate the challenge. Additionally, QML providers may rely on a third-party quantum cloud for hosting the model, exposing the models and training data. As QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) becomes more prevalent, reliance on third party quantum clouds can pose a significant threat. This paper shows that adversaries in quantum clouds can use white-box access of the QML model during training to extract the state preparation circuit (containing training data) along with the labels. The extracted training data can be reused for training a clone model or sold for profit. We propose a suite of techniques to prune and fix the incorrect labels. Results show that $\approx$90\% labels can be extracted correctly. The same model trained on the adversarially extracted data achieves approximately $\approx$90\% accuracy, closely matching the accuracy achieved when trained on the original data. To mitigate this threat, we propose masking labels/classes and modifying the cost function for label obfuscation, reducing adversarial label prediction accuracy by $\approx$70\%.</description>

      <title>Stability of quantum many-body scars on PXP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of quantum many-body scars under perturbations, within the PXP model. We numerically compute the fidelity and average correlations to monitor the state evolution and to identify revivals. The results indicate that, on the one hand, the entanglement entropy of PXP scars exhibit great sensitivity, in the sense that their profile approaches the ones expected for thermal states already for very small perturbations. On the other hand, other scar signatures, such as the revivals of states having large overlap with scars, show remarkable robustness. Additionally, we examined the effects of minor disturbances on initial states that previously exhibited high overlap with scars and consistent revivals. Our analysis revealed that different types of disturbances can induce markedly different behaviors, such as partially "freezing" the chain, leading to sustained oscillations, or accelerating the process of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity can not only generate quantum resources, but also shield noise and reverse interference from driving signals. We investigate the advantages of nonreciprocal coupling in sensing a driving signal. In general, we find that the nonreciprocal coupling performs better than the corresponding reciprocal coupling. And we show that homodyne measurement is the optimal measurement. A single non-reciprocal coupling can increase measurement precision up to 2 times. Using $N$ non-reciprocal couplings in parallel, the measurement precision can be improved by $N^2$ times compared with the corresponding reciprocal coupling. In a non-zero temperature dissipative environment, we demonstrate that the nonreciprocal quantum sensing has better robustness to thermal noise than the reciprocal quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Formulation of Mutual Information for Sensor Placement Optimization using Ising and Quantum Annealing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a combinatorial optimization problem to determine the placement of a predefined number of sensors from multiple candidate positions, aiming to maximize information acquisition with the minimum number of sensors. Assuming that the data from predefined candidates of sensor placements follow a multivariate normal distribution, we defined mutual information (MI) between the data from selected sensor positions and the data from the others as an objective function, and formulated it in a Quadratic Unconstrainted Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem by using a method we proposed. As an example, we calculated optimal solutions of the objective functions for 3 candidates of sensor placements using a quantum annealing machine, and confirmed that the results obtained were reasonable. The formulation method we proposed can be applied to any number of sensors, and it is expected that the advantage of quantum annealing emerges as the number of sensors increases.</description>

      <title>Eikonal Approximation for Floquet Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eikonal approximation (EA) is widely used in various high-energy scattering problems. In this work we generalize this approximation from the scattering problems with time-independent Hamiltonian to the ones with periodical Hamiltonians, {\it i.e.}, the Floquet scattering problems. We further illustrate the applicability of our generalized EA via the scattering problem with respect to a shaking spherical square-well potential,
  by comparing the results given by this approximation and the exact ones. The generalized EA we developed is helpful for the research of manipulation of high-energy scattering processes with external field, {\it e.g.}, the manipulation of atom, molecule or nuclear collisions or reactions via strong laser fields.</description>

      <title>L2O-$g^{\dagger}$: Learning to Optimize Parameterized Quantum Circuits with Fubini-Study Metric Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Before the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computers, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) play a crucial role in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines. Conventionally, the optimization of VQAs predominantly relies on manually designed optimizers. However, learning to optimize (L2O) demonstrates impressive performance by training small neural networks to replace handcrafted optimizers. In our work, we propose L2O-$g^{\dagger}$, a $\textit{quantum-aware}$ learned optimizer that leverages the Fubini-Study metric tensor ($g^{\dagger}$) and long short-term memory networks. We theoretically derive the update equation inspired by the lookahead optimizer and incorporate the quantum geometry of the optimization landscape in the learned optimizer to balance fast convergence and generalization. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments across a range of VQA problems. Our results demonstrate that L2O-$g^{\dagger}$ not only outperforms the current SOTA hand-designed optimizer without any hyperparameter tuning but also shows strong out-of-distribution generalization compared to previous L2O optimizers. We achieve this by training L2O-$g^{\dagger}$ on just a single generic PQC instance. Our novel $\textit{quantum-aware}$ learned optimizer, L2O-$g^{\dagger}$, presents an advancement in addressing the challenges of VQAs, making it a valuable tool in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Post-Measurement Pairing Quantum Key Distribution with Local Optical Frequency Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of post-measurement coincidence pairing simplifies substantially long-distance, repeater-like quantum key distribution (QKD) by eliminating the need for tracking the differential phase of the users' lasers. However, optical frequency tracking remains necessary and can become a severe burden in future deployment of multi-node quantum networks. Here, we resolve this problem by referencing each user's laser to an absolute frequency standard and demonstrate a practical post-measurement pairing QKD with excellent long-term stability. We confirm the setup's repeater-like behavior and achieve a finite-size secure key rate (SKR) of 15.94 bit/s over 504 km fiber, which overcomes the absolute repeaterless bound by 1.28 times. Over a fiber length 100 km, the setup delivers an impressive SKR of 285.68 kbit/s. Our work paves the way towards an efficient muti-user quantum network with the local frequency standard.</description>

      <title>Virtual Z gates and symmetric gate compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The virtual Z gate has been established as an important tool for performing quantum gates on various platforms, including but not limited to superconducting systems. Many such platforms offer a limited set of calibrated gates and compile other gates, such as the Y gate, using combinations of X and virtual Z gates. Here, we show that the method of compilation has important consequences in an open quantum system setting. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate that it is crucial to choose a compilation that is symmetric with respect to virtual Z rotations. This is particularly pronounced in dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences, where improper gate decomposition can result in unintended effects such as the implementation of the wrong sequence. Our findings indicate that in many cases the performance of DD is adversely affected by the incorrect use of virtual Z gates, compounding other coherent pulse errors. In addition, we identify another source of coherent errors: interference between consecutive pulses that follow each other too closely. This work provides insights into improving general quantum gate performance and optimizing DD sequences in particular.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Verification of Genuine Multipartite Nonlocality and Full Network Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite nonlocality and nonlocality arising in networks composed of several independent sources have been separately investigated. While some genuinely entangled states cannot be verified by violating a single Bell-type inequality, a quantum network consisting of different sources allows for the certification of the non-classicality of all sources. In this paper, we propose the first method to verify both types of nonlocality simultaneously in a single experiment. We consider a quantum network comprising a bipartite source and a tripartite source. We demonstrate that there are quantum correlations cannot be simulated if the tripartite source distributes biseparable systems while the bipartite source distributes even stronger-than-quantum systems. These correlations can be used to verify both the genuine multipartite nonlocality of generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and the full network nonlocality that is stronger than all the existing results. Experimentally, we observe both types of nonlocality in a high fidelity photonic quantum network by violating a single network Bell inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of discriminating between two bosonic dephasing quantum channels. We show that unambiguous discrimination is not realizable. We then consider discrimination with nonzero error probability and minimize this latter in the absence of input constraints. In the presence of an input energy constraint, we derive an upper bound on the error probability. Finally, we extend these results from single-shot to multi-shot discrimination, envisaging the asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a scheme to characterise a qudit T gate that has different noise than a set of Clifford gates. We developed our scheme through representation theory and ring theory to generalise non-Clifford interleaved benchmarking to qudit systems. By restricting to the qubit case, we recover the dihedral benchmarking scheme. Our characterisation scheme provides experimental physicists a practical method for characterising universal qudit gate sets and advances randomised benchmarking research by providing the characterisation of a complete qudit library.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Telegate and Teledata Protocols for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost of distributed quantum operations such as the telegate and teledata protocols is high due to latencies from distributing entangled photons and classical information. This paper proposes an extension to the telegate and teledata protocols to allow for asynchronous classical communication which hides the cost of distributed quantum operations. We then discuss the benefits and limitations of these asynchronous protocols and propose a potential way to improve these asynchronous protocols using nonunitary operators. Finally, a quantum network card is described as an example of how asynchronous quantum operations might be used.</description>

      <title>Proposal for Composite Quantum Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Heat Engine Coupled by a Nanomechanical Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum heat engine model that utilizes an ultracold atomic gas coupled with a nanomechanical mirror. The mirror's vibration induces an opto-mechanical sideband in the control field, affecting the behavior of the cold gas and subsequently influencing the output radiation of the engine. The model incorporates mirror vibration while omitting cavity confinement, establishing a bridge between a multi-level atom-laser interacting system that plays with coherences and the mechanical vibration of the nanomechanical mirror, which jointly function as heat engines. Three distinct heat engine configurations are proposed: the first involves a vibration-free three-level $\Lambda$-type system, the second introduces nanomechanical vibration to the three-level $\Lambda$-type system, and the third constitutes a composite engine that combines the previous setups along with nanomechanical vibration. The spectral brightness of a three-level heat engine is diminished with mirror vibration, whereas for a composite heat engine, there is a slight enhancement in the brightness peak. However, the maximum brightness is attained when there is no vibration. Comparisons between the proposed model and an ideal system are made regarding entropy balance, adhering to the constraints of the second law of thermodynamics. The model observed that when subjected to mirror vibration, the proposed heat engines diverged from the characteristics expected in an ideal heat engine.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of reconstructing quantum states with generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography, a process that reconstructs a quantum state from measurements on an ensemble of identically prepared copies, plays a crucial role in benchmarking quantum devices. However, brute-force approaches to quantum state tomography would become impractical for large systems, as the required resources scale exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore a machine learning approach and report an experimental demonstration of reconstructing quantum states based on neural network generative models with an array of programmable superconducting transmon qubits. In particular, we experimentally prepare the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and random states up to five qubits and demonstrate that the machine learning approach can efficiently reconstruct these states with the number of required experimental samples scaling linearly with system size. Our results experimentally showcase the intriguing potential for exploiting machine learning techniques in validating and characterizing complex quantum devices, offering a valuable guide for the future development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Truncated Differential and Boomerang Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facing the worldwide steady progress in building quantum computers, it is crucial for cryptographic community to design quantum-safe cryptographic primitives. To achieve this, we need to investigate the capability of cryptographic analysis tools when used by the adversaries with quantum computers. In this article, we concentrate on truncated differential and boomerang cryptanalysis. We first present a quantum algorithm which is designed for finding truncated differentials of symmetric ciphers. We prove that, with a overwhelming probability, the truncated differentials output by our algorithm must have high differential probability for the vast majority of keys in key space. Afterwards, based on this algorithm, we design a quantum algorithm which can be used to find boomerang distinguishers. The quantum circuits of both quantum algorithms contain only polynomial quantum gates. Compared to classical tools for searching truncated differentials or boomerang distinguishers, our algorithms fully utilize the strengths of quantum computing, and can maintain the polynomial complexity while fully considering the impact of S-boxes and key scheduling.</description>

      <title>Spin Qubits with Scalable milli-kelvin CMOS Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key virtue of spin qubits is their sub-micron footprint, enabling a single silicon chip to host the millions of qubits required to execute useful quantum algorithms with error correction. With each physical qubit needing multiple control lines however, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware. A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired-up via miniaturized interconnects. Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise. Here, we benchmark silicon MOS-style electron spin qubits controlled via heterogeneously-integrated cryo-CMOS circuits with a low enough power density to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently enable universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that mill-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our milli-kelvin CMOS platform, with some 100-thousand transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a chiplet style control architecture.</description>

      <title>Thermometry of Trapped Ions Based on Bichromatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate thermometry of laser-cooled ions is crucial for the performance of the trapped-ions quantum computing platform. However, most existing methods face a computational exponential bottleneck. Recently, a thermometry method based on bichromatic driving was theoretically proposed by Ivan Vybornyi et al. to overcome this obstacle, which allows the computational complexity to remain constant with the increase of ion numbers. In this paper, we provide a detailed statistical analysis of this method and prove its robustness to several imperfect experimental conditions using Floquet theory. We then experimentally verify its good performance on a linear segmented surface-electrode ion trap platform for the first time. This method is proven to be effective from near the motional ground state to a few mean phonon numbers. Our theoretical analysis and experimental verification demonstrate that the scheme can accurately and efficiently measure the temperature in ion crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of energy cost needed for acceleration (deceleration) of the evolution of a quantum system using the Masuda-Nakamura fast forward protocol. In particular, we focus on dynamics by considering models for a quantum box with a moving wall and harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency. For both models we computed the energy needed for acceleration (deceleration) as a function of time. The results obtained are compared with those of other acceleration (deceleration) protocols</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Involvement of the environment is indispensable for establishing the statistical distribution of system. We analyze the statistical distribution of a quantum system coupled strongly with a heat bath. This distribution is determined by tracing over the bath's degrees of freedom for the equilibrium system-plus-bath composite. The stability of system distribution is largely affected by the system--bath interaction strength. We propose that the quantum system exhibits a stable distribution only when its system response function in the frequency domain satisfies $\tilde\chi(\omega = 0+)&gt;0$. We show our results by investigating the non-interacting bosonic impurity system from both the thermodynamic and dynamic perspectives. Our study refines the theoretical framework of canonical statistics, offering insights into thermodynamic phenomena in small-scale systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. While the upper bound of the simulation cost has been extensively studied through various quantum algorithms, much less work has focused on establishing the lower bound, particularly for the simulation of open quantum system dynamics. In this work, we present a general framework to calculate the lower bound for simulating a broad class of quantum Markov semigroups. Given a fixed accessible unitary set, we introduce the concept of convexified circuit depth to quantify the quantum simulation cost and analyze the necessary circuit depth to construct a quantum simulation scheme that achieves a specific order. Our framework can be applied to both unital and non-unital quantum dynamics, and the tightness of our lower bound technique is illustrated by showing that the upper and lower bounds coincide in several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nanomechanical resonators display ultra-long lifetimes at cryogenic temperatures and microwave frequencies. Achieving quantum control of single-phonons in these devices has so far relied on nonlinearities enabled by coupling to ancillary qubits. In this work, we propose using atomic forces to realize a silicon nanomechanical qubit without coupling to an ancillary qubit. The proposed qubit operates at 60 MHz with a single-phonon level anharmonicity of 5 MHz. We present a circuit quantum acoustodynamics architecture where electromechanical resonators enable dispersive state readout and multi-qubit operations. The combination of strong anharmonicity, ultrahigh mechanical quality factors, and small footprints achievable in this platform could enable quantum-nonlinear phononics for quantum information processing and transduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To optimize the entanglement detection, we formulate the metrologically operational entanglement condition in quantum Fisher information(QFI) by maximizing the QFI on the measurement orbit. Specifically, we consider two classes of typical local observables, i.e. the local orthonormal observables (LOO) and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVM). Result shows that the SIC-POVM is superior to LOO in entanglement detection, which in some sense hints the yet unconfirmed generally superiority of SIC-POVM in quantum information processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed characterization of two inductively coupled superconducting fluxonium qubits for implementing high-fidelity cross-resonance gates. Our circuit stands out because it behaves very closely to the case of two transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. In particular, the generally unwanted static ZZ-term due to the non-computational transitions is nearly absent despite a strong qubit-qubit hybridization. Spectroscopy of the non-computational transitions reveals a spurious LC-mode arising from the combination of the coupling inductance and the capacitive links between the terminals of the two qubit circuits. Such a mode has a minor effect on our specific device, but it must be carefully considered for optimizing future designs.</description>

      <title>Error correction for encoded quantum annealing revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F. Pastawski and J. Preskill discussed error correction of quantum annealing (QA) based on a parity-encoded spin system, known as the Sourlas-Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (SLHZ) system. They pointed out that the SLHZ system is closely related to a classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and demonstrated its error-correcting capability through a belief propagation (BP) algorithm assuming independent random spin-flip errors. In contrast, Ablash et al. suggested that the SLHZ system does not receive the benefits of post-readout decoding. The reason is that independent random spin-flips are not the most relevant error arising from sampling excited states during the annealing process, whether in closed or open system cases. In this work, we revisit this issue: we propose a very simple decoding algorithm to eliminate errors in the readout of SLHZ systems and show experimental evidence suggesting that SLHZ system exhibits error-correcting capability in decoding annealing readouts. Our new algorithm can be thought of as a bit-flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Assuming an independent and identical noise model, we found that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the BP algorithm. The error correcting-capability for the sampled readouts was investigated using Monte Carlo calculations that simulate the final time distribution of QA. The results show that the algorithm successfully eliminates errors in the sampled readouts under conditions where error-free state or even code state is not sampled at all. Our simulation suggests that decoding of annealing readouts will be successful if the correctable states can be sampled by annealing, and annealing can be considered to play a role as a pre-process of the classical decoding process. This knowledge will be useful for designing and developing practical QA based on the SLHZ system in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QMA-completeness of the local Hamiltonian problem is a landmark result of the field of Hamiltonian complexity that studies the computational complexity of problems in quantum many-body physics. Since its proposal, substantial effort has been invested in better understanding the problem for physically motivated important families of Hamiltonians. In particular, the QMA-completeness of approximating the ground state energy of local Hamiltonians has been extended to the case where the Hamiltonians are geometrically local in one and two spatial dimensions. Among those physically motivated Hamiltonians, stoquastic Hamiltonians play a particularly crucial role, as they constitute the manifestly sign-free Hamiltonians in Monte Carlo approaches. Interestingly, for such Hamiltonians, the problem at hand becomes more ''classical'', being hard for the class MA (the randomized version of NP) and its complexity has tight connections with derandomization. In this work, we prove that both the two- and one-dimensional geometrically local analogues remain MA-hard with high enough qudit dimension. Moreover, we show that related problems are StoqMA-complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization solvers typically rely on one-variable-to-one-qubit mapping. However, the low qubit count on current quantum computers is a major obstacle in competing against classical methods. Here, we develop a qubit-efficient algorithm that overcomes this limitation by mapping a candidate bit string solution to an entangled wave function of fewer qubits. We propose a variational quantum circuit generalizing the quantum approximate optimization ansatz (QAOA). Extremizing the ansatz for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass problems, we show valuable properties such as the concentration of ansatz parameters and derive performance guarantees. This approach could benefit near-term intermediate-scale and future fault-tolerant small-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling mediated photon-like resonance for a single atom trapped in a symmetric double well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a method involving coherent periodic modulation of Raman laser intensity to induce resonance transitions between energy levels of a spin-orbit coupled atom in a symmetric double-well trap. By integrating photon-assisted tunneling (PAT) technique with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we achieve resonance transitions between the predefined energy levels of the atom, thereby enabling further precise control of the atom's dynamics. We observe that such photon-like resonance can induce a transition from a localized state to atomic Rabi oscillation between two wells, or effectively reduce tunneling as manifested by a quantum beating phenomenon. Moreover, such resonance transitions have the potential to induce spin flipping in a spin-orbit coupled atom. Additionally, the SOC-mediated transition from multiphoton resonance to fundamental resonance and the SOC-induced resonance suppression are also discovered. In these cases, the analytical results of the effective coupling coefficients of the resonance transition derived from a four-level model can account for the entire dynamics, demonstrating surprisingly good agreement with the numerically exact results based on the realistic continuous model.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Circuit Reusing and its Application in Randomized Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum learning tasks often leverage randomly sampled quantum circuits to characterize unknown systems. An efficient approach known as "circuit reusing," where each circuit is executed multiple times, reduces the cost compared to implementing new circuits. This work investigates the optimal reusing parameter that minimizes the variance of measurement outcomes for a given experimental cost. We establish a theoretical framework connecting the variance of experimental estimators with the reusing parameter R. An optimal R is derived when the implemented circuits and their noise characteristics are known. Additionally, we introduce a near-optimal reusing strategy that is applicable even without prior knowledge of circuits or noise, achieving variances close to the theoretical minimum. To validate our framework, we apply it to randomized benchmarking and analyze the optimal R for various typical noise channels. We further conduct experiments on a superconducting platform, revealing a non-linear relationship between R and the cost, contradicting previous assumptions in the literature. Our theoretical framework successfully incorporates this non-linearity and accurately predicts the experimentally observed optimal R. These findings underscore the broad applicability of our approach to experimental realizations of quantum learning protocols.</description>

Abstract: Two-way quantum computers (2WQC) are proposed extension of standard 1WQC: adding conjugated state preparation operation $\langle 0|$ similar to postselection $|0\ra \langle 0|$, by performing a process which from perspective of CPT symmetry is the original state preparation process, for example by reversing EM impulses used for state preparation. As there were concerns that this extension might violate no-cloning theorem for example for attacks on quantum cryptographic protocols like BB84, here we extend the original proof to show this theorem still holds for 2WQC and postselection.</description>

      <title>Concurrent VQE for Simulating Excited States of the Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the application of the concurrent variational quantum eigensolver (cVQE) for computing excited states of the Schwinger model. By designing suitable ansatz circuits utilizing universal SO(4) or SO(8) qubit gates, we demonstrate how to efficiently obtain the lowest two, four, and eight eigenstates with one, two, and three ancillary qubits for both vanishing and non-vanishing background electric field cases. Simulating the resulting quantum circuits classically with tensor network techniques, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to compute the two lowest eigenstates of systems with up to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ qubits. Given that our method allows for measuring the low-lying spectrum precisely, we also present a novel technique for estimating the additive mass renormalization of the lattice based on the energy gap. As a proof-of-principle calculation, we prepare the ground and first-excited states with one ancillary and four physical qubits on quantum hardware, demonstrating the practicality of using the cVQE to simulate excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modularity is a promising approach for scaling up quantum computers and therefore integrating higher qubit counts. The essence of such architectures lies in their reliance on high-fidelity and fast quantum state transfers enabled by generating entanglement between chips. In addressing the challenge of implementing quantum coherent communication channels to interconnect quantum processors, various techniques have been proposed to account for qubit technology specifications and the implemented communication protocol. By employing Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodologies, this work presents a comparative analysis of the cavity-mediated interconnect technologies according to a defined figure of merit, and we identify the configurations related to the cavity and atomic decay rates as well as the qubit-cavity coupling strength that meet the efficiency thresholds. We therefore contribute to benchmarking contemporary cavity-mediated quantum interconnects and guide the development of reliable and scalable chip-to-chip links for modular quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Utilizing probabilistic entanglement between sensors in quantum networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of quantum networks is entanglement assisted sensing. The field of quantum metrology exploits quantum correlations to improve the precision bound for applications such as precision timekeeping, field sensing, and biological imaging. When measuring multiple spatially distributed parameters, current literature focuses on quantum entanglement in the discrete variable case, and quantum squeezing in the continuous variable case, distributed amongst all of the sensors in a given network. However, it can be difficult to ensure all sensors pre-share entanglement of sufficiently high fidelity. This work probes the space between fully entangled and fully classical sensing networks by modeling a star network with probabilistic entanglement generation that is attempting to estimate the average of local parameters. The quantum Fisher information is used to determine which protocols best utilize entanglement as a resource for different network conditions. It is shown that without entanglement distillation there is a threshold fidelity below which classical sensing is preferable. For a network with a given number of sensors and links characterized by a certain initial fidelity and probability of success, this work outlines when and how to use entanglement, when to store it, and when it needs to be distilled.</description>

      <title>Landauer principle and the second law in a relativistic communication scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of formulating thermodynamics in a relativistic scenario remains unresolved, although many proposals exist in the literature. The challenge arises due to the intrinsic dynamic structure of spacetime as established by the general theory of relativity. With the discovery of the physical nature of information, which underpins Landauer's principle, we believe that information theory should play a role in understanding this problem. In this work, we contribute to this endeavor by considering a relativistic communication task between two partners, Alice and Bob, in a general Lorentzian spacetime. We then assume that the receiver, Bob, reversibly operates a local heat engine powered by information, and seek to determine the maximum amount of work he can extract from this device. Since Bob cannot extract work for free, by applying both Landauer's principle and the second law of thermodynamics, we establish a bound on the energy Bob must spend to acquire the information in the first place. This bound is a function of the spacetime metric and the properties of the communication channel.</description>

      <title>Slow Light through Brillouin Scattering in Continuum Quantum Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of achieving a slow signal field at the level of single photons inside nanofibers by exploiting stimulated Brillouin scattering, which involves a strong pump field and the vibrational modes of the waveguide. The slow signal is significantly amplified for a pump field with a frequency higher than that of the signal, and attenuated for a lower pump frequency. We introduce a configuration for obtaining a propagating slow signal without gain or loss and with a relatively wide bandwidth. This process involves two strong pump fields with frequencies both higher and lower than that of the signal, where the effects of signal amplification and attenuation compensate each other. We account for thermal fluctuations due to the scattering off thermal phonons and identify conditions under which thermal contributions to the signal field are negligible. The slowing of light through Brillouin optomechanics may serve as a vital tool for optical quantum information processing and quantum communications within nanophotonic structures.</description>

      <title>Measuring a "Probability" $&gt; 1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The history based formalism known as Quantum Measure Theory (QMT) generalizes the concept of probability-measure so as to incorporate quantum interference. Because interference can result in a greater intensity than the simple sum of the component intensities, the \textit{quantum measure} can exceed unity, exhibiting its non-classical nature in a particularly striking manner. Here we study the two-site hopper within the context of QMT; and in an optical experiment, we determine the measure of a specific hopper event, using an ancilla based event filtering scheme. For this measure we report a value of $1.172$, which exceeds the maximum value permissible for a classical probability (namely $1$) by $13.3$ standard deviations. If an unconventional theoretical concept is to play a role in meeting the foundational challenges of quantum theory, then it seems important to bring it into contact with experiment as much as possible. Our experiment does this for the quantum measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process tensors are quantum combs describing the evolution of open quantum systems through multiple steps of a quantum dynamics. While there is more than one way to measure how different two processes are, special care must be taken to ensure quantifiers obey physically desirable conditions such as data processing inequalities. Here, we analyze two classes of distinguishability measures commonly used in general applications of quantum combs. We show that the first class, called Choi divergences, does not satisfy an important data processing inequality, while the second one, which we call generalized divergences, does. We also extend to quantum combs some other relevant results of generalized divergences of quantum channels. Finally, given the properties we proved, we argue that generalized divergences may be more adequate than Choi divergences for distinguishing quantum combs in most of their applications. Particularly, this is crucial for defining monotones for resource theories whose states have a comb structure, such as resource theories of quantum processes and resource theories of quantum strategies.</description>

      <title>Comparing Algorithms for Loading Classical Datasets into Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are gaining importance in various applications like quantum machine learning and quantum signal processing. These applications face significant challenges in loading classical datasets into quantum memory. With numerous algorithms available and multiple quality attributes to consider, comparing data loading methods is complex.
  Our objective is to compare (in a structured manner) various algorithms for loading classical datasets into quantum memory (by converting statevectors to circuits).
  We evaluate state preparation algorithms based on five key attributes: circuit depth, qubit count, classical runtime, statevector representation (dense or sparse), and circuit alterability. We use the Pareto set as a multi-objective optimization tool to identify algorithms with the best combination of properties. To improve comprehension and speed up comparisons, we also visually compare three metrics (namely, circuit depth, qubit count, and classical runtime).
  We compare seven algorithms for dense statevector conversion and six for sparse statevector conversion. Our analysis reduces the initial set of algorithms to two dense and two sparse groups, highlighting inherent trade-offs.
  This comparison methodology offers a structured approach for selecting algorithms based on specific needs. Researchers and practitioners can use it to help select data-loading algorithms for various quantum computing tasks.</description>

      <title>An instructional lab apparatus for quantum experiments with single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hands-on experimental experience with quantum systems in the undergraduate physics curriculum provides students with a deeper understanding of quantum physics and equips them for the fast-growing quantum science industry. Here we present an experimental apparatus for performing quantum experiments with single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. This apparatus is capable of basic experiments such as single-qubit initialization, rotation, and measurement, as well as more advanced experiments investigating electron-nuclear spin interactions. We describe the basic physics of the NV center and give examples of potential experiments that can be performed with this apparatus. We also discuss the options and inherent trade-offs associated with the choice of diamond samples and hardware. The apparatus described here enables students to write their own experimental control and data analysis software from scratch all within a single semester of a typical lab course, as well as to inspect the optical components and inner workings of the apparatus. We hope that this work can serve as a standalone resource for any institution that would like to integrate a quantum instructional lab into its undergraduate physics and engineering curriculum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conference Key Agreement (CKA) provides a secure method for multi-party communication. A recently developed interference-based prepare-and-measure quantum CKA possesses the advantages of measurement-device-independence, namely, being immune to side-channels from the detector side. Besides, it achieves good key rate performance, especially for high-loss channels, due to the use of single photon interference. Meanwhile, several fully passive QKD schemes have been proposed, which eliminate all side channels from the source modulation side. We extend the passive idea to an interference-based CKA, which has a high level of implementation security for many-user communication.</description>

      <title>In Search of Quantum Advantage: Estimating the Number of Shots in Quantum Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has gathered significant attention through approaches like Quantum Kernel Machines. While these methods hold considerable promise, their quantum nature presents inherent challenges. One major challenge is the limited resolution of estimated kernel values caused by the finite number of circuit runs performed on a quantum device. In this study, we propose a comprehensive system of rules and heuristics for estimating the required number of circuit runs in quantum kernel methods. We introduce two critical effects that necessitate an increased measurement precision through additional circuit runs: the spread effect and the concentration effect. The effects are analyzed in the context of fidelity and projected quantum kernels. To address these phenomena, we develop an approach for estimating desired precision of kernel values, which, in turn, is translated into the number of circuit runs. Our methodology is validated through extensive numerical simulations, focusing on the problem of exponential value concentration. We stress that quantum kernel methods should not only be considered from the machine learning performance perspective, but also from the context of the resource consumption. The results provide insights into the possible benefits of quantum kernel methods, offering a guidance for their application in quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimization complexity and resource minimization of emitter-based photonic graph state generation protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic graph states are important for measurement- and fusion-based quantum computing, quantum networks, and sensing. They can in principle be generated deterministically by using emitters to create the requisite entanglement. Finding ways to minimize the number of entangling gates between emitters and understanding the overall optimization complexity of such protocols is crucial for practical implementations. Here, we address these issues using graph theory concepts. We develop optimizers that minimize the number of entangling gates, reducing them by up to 75$\%$ compared to naive schemes for moderately sized random graphs. While the complexity of optimizing emitter-emitter CNOT counts is likely NP-hard, we are able to develop heuristics based on strong connections between graph transformations and the optimization of stabilizer circuits. These patterns allow us to process large graphs and still achieve a reduction of up to $66\%$ in emitter CNOTs, without relying on subtle metrics such as edge density. We find the optimal emission orderings and circuits to prepare unencoded and encoded repeater graph states of any size, achieving global minimization of emitter and CNOT resources despite the average NP-hardness of both optimization problems. We further study the locally equivalent orbit of graphs. Although enumerating orbits is $\#$P complete for arbitrary graphs, we analytically calculate the size of the orbit of repeater graphs and find a procedure to generate the orbit for any repeater size. Finally, we inspect the entangling gate cost of preparing any graph from a given orbit and show that we can achieve the same optimal CNOT count across the orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluxonium qubit is a promising building block for quantum information processing due to its long coherence time and strong anharmonicity. In this paper, we realize a 60 ns direct CNOT-gate on two inductively-coupled fluxonium qubits using selective darkening approach, resulting in a gate fidelity as high as 99.94%. The fidelity remains above 99.9% for 24 days without any recalibration between randomized benchmarking measurements. Compared with the 99.96% fidelity of a 60 ns identity gate, our data brings the investigation of the non-decoherence-related errors during gate operations down to $2 \times 10^{-4}$. The present result adds a simple and robust two-qubit gate into the still relatively small family of "the beyond three nines" demonstrations on superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations have demonstrated that multi-phonon scattering processes substantially influence the thermal conductivity of materials, posing significant computational challenges for classical simulations as the complexity of phonon modes escalates. This study examines the potential of quantum simulations to address these challenges, utilizing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era (NISQ) quantum computational capabilities and quantum error mitigation techniques to optimize thermal conductivity calculations. Employing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we simulate phonon-phonon contributions based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). Our methodology involves mapping multi-phonon scattering systems to fermionic spin operators, necessitating the creation of a customized ansatz to balance circuit accuracy and depth. We construct the system within Fock space using bosonic operators and transform the Hamiltonian into the sum of Pauli operators suitable for quantum computation. By addressing the impact of non-unitary noise effects, we benchmark the noise influence and implement error mitigation strategies to develop a more efficient model for quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: Creating macroscopic spatial quantum superposition with a nanoparticle has a multitude of applications, ranging from testing the foundations of quantum mechanics, matter-wave interferometer for detecting gravitational waves and probing the electromagnetic vacuum, dark matter detection and quantum sensors to testing the quantum nature of gravity in a lab. In this paper, we investigate the role of rotation in a matter-wave interferometer, where we show that imparting angular momentum along the direction of a defect, such as one present in the nitrogen-vacancy centre of a nanodiamond can cause an enhancement in spin contrast for a wide-ranging value of the angular momentum, e.g. $10^{3}-10^{6}$~Hz for a mass of order $10^{-14}-10^{-17}$ Kg nanodiamond. Furthermore, the imparted angular momentum can enhance the spatial superposition by almost a factor of two and possibly average out any potential permanent dipoles in the nanodiamond.</description>

Abstract: A defining property of Hawking radiation is that states with very low entanglement masquerade as highly mixed states; this property is captured by a quantum computational phenomenon known as spoofing entanglement. Motivated by the potential implications for black hole information and the emergence of spacetime connectivity, as well as possible applications of spoofing entanglement, we investigate the geometrization of two types of entanglement spoofers in AdS/CFT: so-called EFI pairs and pseudoentangled state ensembles. We show that (a strengthened version of) EFI pairs with a semiclassical bulk dual have a Python's Lunch; the maximally mixed state over the pseudoentangled state ensemble likewise features a Python's Lunch. Since a Python's Lunch must lie behind an event horizon, we find that black holes are the exclusive gravitational source of entanglement spoofing in the semiclassical limit. Finally, we use an extant construction of holographic pseudorandom states to yield a candidate example of a pseudoentangled state ensemble with a semiclassical bulk dual.</description>

      <title>DanceQ: High-performance library for number conserving bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum many-body problems scales exponentially with the size of the system, rendering any finite size scaling analysis a formidable challenge. This is particularly true for methods based on the full representation of the wave function, where one simply accepts the enormous Hilbert space dimensions and performs linear algebra operations, e.g., for finding the ground state of the Hamiltonian. If the system satisfies an underlying symmetry where an operator with degenerate spectrum commutes with the Hamiltonian, it can be block-diagonalized, thus reducing the complexity at the expense of additional bookkeeping. At the most basic level, required for Krylov space techniques (like the Lanczos algorithm) it is necessary to implement a matrix-vector product of a block of the Hamiltonian with arbitrary block-wavefunctions, potentially without holding the Hamiltonian block in memory. An efficient implementation of this operation requires the calculation of the position of an arbitrary basis vector in the canonical ordering of the basis of the block. We present here an elegant and powerful, multi-dimensional approach to this problem for the $U(1)$ symmetry appearing in problems with particle number conservation. Our divide-and-conquer algorithm uses multiple subsystems and hence generalizes previous approaches to make them scalable. In addition to the theoretical presentation of our algorithm, we provide DanceQ, a flexible and modern - header only - C++20 implementation to manipulate, enumerate, and map to its index any basis state in a given particle number sector as open source software under https://DanceQ.gitlab.io/danceq.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Born Oppenheimer Approximation for Molecules and Materials via Electric Field Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ab initio method for computing vibro-polariton and phonon-polariton spectra of molecules and solids coupled to the photon modes of optical cavities. We demonstrate that if interactions of cavity photon modes with both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom are treated on the level of the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation (CBOA), spectra can be expressed in terms of the matter response to electric fields and nuclear displacements which are readily available in standard density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) implementations. In this framework, results over a range of cavity parameters can be obtained without the need for additional electronic structure calculations, enabling efficient calculations on a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, this approach enables results to be more readily interpreted in terms of the more familiar cavity-independent molecular electric field response properties, such as polarizability and Born effective charges which enter into the vibro-polariton calculation. Using corresponding electric field response properties of bulk insulating systems, we are also able to obtain $\Gamma$ point phonon-polariton spectra of two dimensional (2D) insulators. Results for a selection of cavity-coupled molecular and 2D crystal systems are presented to demonstrate the method.</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of boundary correlation functions for the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze boundary spin correlation functions of the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model from the holographic point of view. Using the corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method, we demonstrate that the boundary correlation function exhibits power-law decay with quasi-periodic oscillation, while the bulk correlation function always decays exponentially. On the basis of the geometric relation between the bulk correlation path and distance along the outer edge boundary, we find that scaling dimensions for the boundary correlation function can be well explained by the combination of the bulk correlation length and background curvatures inherent to the hyperbolic lattice. We also investigate the cutoff effect of the bond dimension in CTMRG, revealing that the long-distance behavior of the boundary spin correlation is accurately described even with a small bond dimension. In contrast, the sort-distance behavior rapidly loses its accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the focus of quantum science shifts from basic research to development and implementation of applied quantum technology, calls for a robust, diverse quantum workforce have increased. However, little research has been done on the design and impact on participants of workforce preparation efforts outside of R1 contexts. In order to begin to answer the question of how program design can or should attend to the needs and interests of diverse groups of students, we performed interviews with students from two Colorado-based quantum education/workforce development programs, one in an undergraduate R1 setting and one in a distributed community setting and serving students largely from two-year colleges. Through analysis of these interviews, we were able to highlight differences between the student populations in the two programs in terms of participation goals, prior and general awareness of quantum science, and career interest and framing of career trajectories. While both groups of students reported benefits from program participation, we highlight the ways in which students' different needs and contexts have informed divergent development of the two programs, framing contextual design of quantum education and workforce efforts as an issue of equity and representation for the burgeoning quantum workforce.</description>

      <title>Non-local quench spectroscopy of fermionic excitations in 1D quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elementary excitations of quantum spin systems have generally the nature of weakly interacting bosonic quasi-particles, generated by local operators acting on the ground state. Nonetheless in one spatial dimension the nature of the quasiparticles can change radically, since many relevant one-dimensional $S=1/2$ Hamiltonians can be exactly mapped onto models of spinless fermions with local hopping and interactions. Due to the non-local nature of the spin-to-fermion mapping, observing directly the fermionic quasiparticle excitations is impossible using local probes, which are at the basis of all the forms of spectroscopy (such as neutron scattering) traditionally available in condensed matter physics. Here we show theoretically that \emph{quench spectroscopy} for synthetic quantum matter -- which probes the excitation spectrum of a system by monitoring the nonequilibrium dynamics of its correlation functions -- can reconstruct accurately the dispersion relation of fermionic quasiparticles in spin chains. This possibility relies on the ability of quantum simulation experiments to measure non-local spin-spin correlation functions, corresponding to elementary fermionic correlation functions. Our analysis is based on new exact results for the quench dynamics of quantum spin chains; and it opens the path to probe arbitrary quasiparticle excitations in synthetic quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an introduction and overview on some basic mathematical aspects of the single-flux Aharonov-Bohm Schr\"odinger operator. The whole family of admissible self-adjoint realizations is characterized by means of four different methods: von Neumann theory, boundary triplets, quadratic forms and Kre{\u\i}n's resolvent formalism. The relation between the different parametrizations thus obtained is explored, comparing the asymptotic behavior of functions in the corresponding operator domains close to the flux singularity. Special attention is devoted to those self-adjoint realizations which preserve the same rotational symmetry and homogeneity under dilations of the basic differential operator. The spectral and scattering properties of all the Hamiltonian operators are finally described.</description>

Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe has a direct correspondence with the Landauer principle of information dynamics. We show that the Landauer limit is satisfied in this case, which implies that the information erasure at the cosmological apparent horizon happens in the most efficient way possible. We also show that our results hold for extensions of the standard entropy formulations. This is the first work which directly provides a correspondence between information dynamics and expanding cosmic horizons, and we discuss several interesting implications of this result.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with anomalous dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on topological models unveils fascinating physics, especially in the realm of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). However, the understanding of entanglement structures and properties near DQPT in models with longer-range hoppings is far from complete. In this work, we study DQPTs in the quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Anomalous DQPTs, where the number of critical momenta exceeds the winding number differences between the pre-quench and post-quench phases, are observed. We find that the entanglement exhibits local maximum (minimum) around the anomalous DQPTs, in line with the level crossings (separations) around the middle of the correlation matrix spectrum. We further categorize the phases in the equilibrium model into two classes and distinctive features in the time evolution of the entanglement involving quenches within and across the two classes are identified. The findings pave the way to a better understanding of topological models with longer-range hoppings in the out-of-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boundaries: efficient Projected Entangled Pair States methods for periodic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are recognized as a potent tool for exploring two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, a significant challenge emerges when applying conventional PEPS methodologies to systems with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), attributed to the prohibitive computational scaling with the bond dimension. This has notably restricted the study of systems with complex boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we have developed a strategy that involves the superposition of PEPS with open boundary conditions (OBC) to treat systems with PBC. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of such systems while maintaining their translational invariance and the PBC. We benchmark this method against the Heisenberg model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, demonstrating its capability to yield highly accurate results at low computational costs, even for large system sizes. The techniques are adaptable to other boundary conditions, including cylindrical and twisted boundary conditions, and therefore significantly expands the application scope of the PEPS approach, shining new light on numerous applications.</description>

      <title>Integrated Mode-Hop-Free Tunable Lasers at 780 nm for Chip-Scale Classical and Quantum Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, remarkable advances in integrated photonic technologies have enabled table-top experiments and instrumentation to be scaled down to compact chips with significant reduction in size, weight, power consumption, and cost. Here, we demonstrate an integrated continuously tunable laser in a heterogeneous gallium arsenide-on-silicon nitride (GaAs-on-SiN) platform that emits in the far-red radiation spectrum near 780 nm, with 20 nm tuning range, &lt;6 kHz intrinsic linewidth, and a &gt;40 dB side-mode suppression ratio. The GaAs optical gain regions are heterogeneously integrated with low-loss SiN waveguides. The narrow linewidth lasing is achieved with an extended cavity consisting of a resonator-based Vernier mirror and a phase shifter. Utilizing synchronous tuning of the integrated heaters, we show mode-hop-free wavelength tuning over a range larger than 100 GHz (200 pm). To demonstrate the potential of the device, we investigate two illustrative applications: (i) the linear characterization of a silicon nitride microresonator designed for entangled-photon pair generation, and (ii) the absorption spectroscopy and locking to the D1 and D2 transition lines of 87-Rb. The performance of the proposed integrated laser holds promise for a broader spectrum of both classical and quantum applications in the visible range, encompassing communication, control, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algebraic characterization of the contractions of the Poincar\'e group permits a proper construction of a non-relativistic limit of its tachyonic representation. We arrive at a consistent, nonstandard representation of the Galilei group which was disregarded long ago by supposedly unphysical properties. The corresponding quantum (and classical) theory shares with the relativistic one their fundamentals, and serves as a toy model to better comprehend the unusual behavior of the tachyonic representation. For instance, we see that evolution takes place in a spatial coordinate rather than time, as for relativistic tachyons, but the modulus of the three-momentum is the same for all Galilean observers, leading to a new dispersion relation for a Galilean system. Furthermore, the tachyonic objects described by the new representation cannot be regarded as localizable in the standard sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of a one-dimensional quintuple-quantum-dot array integrated with two quantum dot charge sensors in an InAs nanowire. The device is studied by measuring double quantum dots formed consecutively in the array and corresponding charge stability diagrams are revealed with both direct current measurements and charge sensor signals. The one-dimensional quintuple-quantum-dot array are then tuned up and its charge configurations are fully mapped out with the two charge sensors. The energy level of each dot in the array can be controlled individually by using a compensated gate architecture (i.e., "virtual gate"). After that, four dots in the array are selected to form two double quantum dots and ultra strong inter-double-dot interaction is obtained. A theoretical simulation based on a 4-dimensional Hamiltonian confirms the strong coupling strength between the two double quantum dots. The highly controllable one-dimensional quantum dot array achieved in this work is expected to be valuable for employing InAs nanowires to construct advanced quantum hardware in the future.</description>

It is shown that the resulting dynamics correctly accounts for nonreactive charge transfer, reactive non charge transfer and reactive charge transfer processes. In addition, it leads to the formation of triatomic DH2+ species as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar semiconductor heterostructures offer versatile device designs and are promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. Notably, heterostructures based on strained germanium have been extensively studied in recent years, with emphasis on their strong and tunable spin-orbit interaction, low effective mass, and high hole mobility. However, planar systems are still limited by the fact that the shape of the confinement potential is directly related to the density. In this work, we present the successful implementation of a backgate for a planar germanium heterostructure. The backgate, in combination with a topgate, enables independent control over the density and the electric field, which determines important state properties such as the effective mass, the $g$-factor and the quantum lifetime. This unparalleled degree of control paves the way towards engineering qubit properties and facilitates the targetted tuning of bilayer quantum wells, which promise denser qubit packing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superior computational power promised by quantum computers utilises the fundamental quantum mechanical principle of entanglement. However, achieving entanglement and verifying that the generated state does not follow the principle of local causality has proven difficult for spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots, as it requires simultaneously high concurrence values and readout fidelities to break the classical bound imposed by Bell's inequality. Here we employ advanced operational protocols for spin qubits in silicon, such as heralded initialization and calibration via gate set tomography (GST), to reduce all relevant errors and push the fidelities of the full 2-qubit gate set above 99%. We demonstrate a 97.17% Bell state fidelity without correcting for readout errors and violate Bell's inequality with a Bell signal of S = 2.731 close to the theoretical maximum of 2{\sqrt{2}}. Our measurements exceed the classical limit even at elevated temperatures of 1.1K or entanglement lifetimes of 100 {\mu}s.</description>

      <title>A Practical Quantum Algorithm for the Schur Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:1709.07119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an efficient quantum algorithm for the quantum Schur transform. The Schur transform is an operation on a quantum computer that maps the standard computational basis to a basis composed of irreducible representations of the unitary and symmetric groups. We simplify and extend the algorithm of Bacon, Chuang, and Harrow, and provide a new practical construction as well as sharp theoretical and practical analyses. Our algorithm decomposes the Schur transform on $n$ qubits into $O\left(n^4\log\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ operators in the Clifford+T fault-tolerant gate set and uses exactly $2\lfloor\log_2(n)\rfloor-1$ ancillary qubits. We extend our qubit algorithm to decompose the Schur transform on $n$ qudits of dimension $d$ into $O\left(d^{1+p}n^{3d}\log^p\left(\frac{d n}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ primitive operators from any universal gate set, for $p\approx3.97$.</description>

      <title>T-count optimization of approximate quantum Fourier transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07739v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a ubiquitous quantum operation that is used in numerous quantum computing applications. The major obstacle to constructing a QFT circuit is that numerous elementary gates are required. Among the elementary gates, T gates dominate the cost of fault-tolerant implementation. Currently, the smallest-known T-count required to construct an n-qubit QFT circuit approximated to error O(\varepsilon) is ~8nlog_2(n/\varepsilon). Moreover, the depth of T gates (T-depth) in the approximate QFT circuit is ~2nlog_2(n/\varepsilon). This approximate QFT circuit was constructed using Toffoli gates and quantum adders. In this study, we present a new n-qubit QFT circuit approximated to error O(\varepsilon). Our approximate QFT circuit shows a T-count of ~4nlog_2(n/\varepsilon) and a T-depth of ~nlog_2(n/\varepsilon). Toffoli gates, which account for half of the T-count in the approximate QFT circuit reported in the previous study, are unnecessary in our construction. Quantum adders, which dominate the leading order term of T-depth in our approximate QFT circuit, are arranged in parallel to reduce T-depth.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling of Continuous Potentials on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gibbs sampling from continuous real-valued functions is a challenging problem of interest in machine learning. Here we leverage quantum Fourier transforms to build a quantum algorithm for this task when the function is periodic. We use the quantum algorithms for solving linear ordinary differential equations to solve the Fokker--Planck equation and prepare a quantum state encoding the Gibbs distribution. We show that the efficiency of interpolation and differentiation of these functions on a quantum computer depends on the rate of decay of the Fourier coefficients of the Fourier transform of the function. We view this property as a concentration of measure in the Fourier domain, and also provide functional analytic conditions for it. Our algorithm makes zeroeth order queries to a quantum oracle of the function. Despite suffering from an exponentially long mixing time, this algorithm allows for exponentially improved precision in sampling, and polynomial quantum speedups in mean estimation in the general case, and particularly under geometric conditions we identify for the critical points of the energy function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take the point of view that building a one-way bridge from experimental data to mathematical models instead of the other way around avoids running into controversies resulting from attaching meaning to the symbols used in the latter. In particular, we show that adopting this view offers new perspectives for constructing mathematical models for and interpreting the results of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments. We first prove new Bell-type inequalities constraining the values of the four correlations obtained by performing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments under four different conditions. The proof is ``model-free'' in the sense that it does not refer to any mathematical model that one imagines to have produced the data. The constraints only depend on the number of quadruples obtained by reshuffling the data in the four data sets without changing the values of the correlations. These new inequalities reduce to model-free versions of the well-known Bell-type inequalities if the maximum fraction of quadruples is equal to one. Being model-free, a violation of the latter by experimental data implies that not all the data in the four data sets can be reshuffled to form quadruples. Furthermore, being model-free inequalities, a violation of the latter by experimental data only implies that any mathematical model assumed to produce this data does not apply. Starting from the data obtained by performing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments, we construct instead of postulate mathematical models that describe the main features of these data. The mathematical framework of plausible reasoning is applied to reproducible and robust data, yielding without using any concept of quantum theory, the expression of the correlation for a system of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state.

Abstract: We show that the delocalization-localization transition in a quantum-many body (QMB) systems is a compelling quantum resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We exploit the vulnerability of a near-transition QMB state against the parameter shift for devising efficient sensing tools. In this realm the main focus of this work is to identify, propose and analyze experimentally relevant quantum observables for precision measurement. Taking a QMB system as a Fermi lattice under quasi-periodic modulation that supports an energy-independent delocalization-localization transition, we suggest operator-based adiabatic and dynamical quantum sensors endowed with considerable quantum advantages.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the performance of traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) based on nonlinear elements like superconducting Josephson junctions (JJs) is vital for qubit read-out in quantum computers. The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to demonstrate how nonlinear inductors based on combinations of JJs can be modeled in commercial circuit simulators, and (b) to show how the harmonic balance (HB) is used in the reliable prediction of the amplifier performance e.g., gain and pump harmonic power conversion. Experimental characterization of two types of TWPA architectures is compared with simulations to showcase the reliability of the HB method. We disseminate the modeling know-how and techniques to new designers of parametric amplifiers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a construction of quantum CSS codes from a tuple of component CSS codes and two collections of subsets. The resulting codes have parallelizable encoding and syndrome measurement circuits and built-in redundancy in the syndrome measurements. In a certain subfamily of the general construction, the resulting codes are related to a natural generalization of classical Reed-Muller codes, and this leads to formulas for the distance of the quantum code as well as for the distance of the associated classical code that protects against errors in the syndrome. The paper gives a number of examples of codes with block size $2^m, m=3,\dots,9$, and with syndrome measurements involving 2, 4 or 8 qubits. These include codes for which the distance exceeds the syndrome measurement weight, as well as codes which provide asymmetric protection against bit flip and phase flip errors.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the sensitivity of tunneling processes to the initial preparation of the quantum state. We compare the case of Gaussian wave packets of different positional variances using a generalised Woods-Saxon potential for which analytical expressions of the tunneling coefficients are available. Using realistic parameters for barrier potentials we find that the usual plane wave approximation underestimates fusion reactivities by an order of magnitude in a range of temperatures of practical relevance for controlled energy production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13691v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal rate at which information can be sent through a quantum channel when the transmitted signal must simultaneously carry some minimum amount of energy is characterized. To do so, we introduce the quantum-classical analogue of the capacity-power function and generalize results in classical information theory for transmitting classical information through noisy channels. We show that the capacity-power function for a classical-quantum channel, for both unassisted and private protocol, is concave and also prove additivity for unentangled and uncorrelated ensembles of input signals for such channels. This implies we do not need regularized formulas for calculation. We show these properties also hold for all noiseless channels when we restrict the set of input states to be pure quantum states. For general channels, we find that the capacity-power function is piece-wise concave. We give an elegant visual proof for this supported by numerical simulations. We connect channel capacity and properties of random quantum states. In particular, we obtain analytical expressions for the capacity-power function for the case of noiseless channels using properties of random quantum states under an energy constraint and concentration phenomena in large Hilbert spaces.</description>

Abstract: We consider an interferometer based on the concept of induced coherence, where two photons that originate in different second-order nonlinear crystals can interfere. We derive a complementarity relationship that links the first-order coherence between the two interfering photons with a parameter that quantifies the distinguishing information regarding the nonlinear crystal where they originated. We show that the derived relationship goes beyond the single-photon regime and is valid for any photon-flux rate generated. We report experimental results in the low photon-flux regime that confirm the validity of the derived complementarity relationship.</description>

Abstract: We study entanglement in a simple model comprising two coupled linear harmonic oscillators of the same natural frequency. The system is separable in the center of mass (COM) and relative coordinates into two oscillators of frequency $\omega_c$ and $\omega_r$. We compute standard entanglement measures (subsystem linear entropy and subsystem von Neumann entropy) as well as several tomographic entanglement indicators (Bhattacharyya distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence and inverse participation ratio) as functions of the frequency ratio $\eta = \omega_c/\omega_r$, keeping the COM oscillator in the ground state. We demonstrate that, overall, the entanglement indicators reflect quite faithfully the variations in the standard measures. The entanglement is shown to be minimum at $\eta = 1$ and maximum as $\eta \to 0$ or $\infty$.</description>

Abstract: Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.</description>

      <title>Reversing Unknown Quantum Processes via Virtual Combs for Channels with Limited Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent irreversibility of quantum dynamics for open systems poses a significant barrier to the inversion of unknown quantum processes. To tackle this challenge, we propose the framework of virtual combs that exploit the unknown process iteratively with additional classical post-processing to simulate the process inverse. Notably, we demonstrate that an $n$-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse a depolarizing channel with one unknown noise parameter out of $n+1$ potential candidates, and a 1-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse an arbitrary pair of quantum channels. We further explore the approximate inversion of an unknown channel within a given channel set. A worst-case error decay of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ is unveiled for depolarizing channels within a specified noise region. Moreover, we show that virtual combs can universally reverse unitary operations and investigate the trade-off between the slot number and the sampling overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-mode NOON states can quantum-enhance multiple-phase estimation in the absence of photon loss. However, a multi-mode NOON state is known to be vulnerable to photon loss, and its quantum-enhancement can be dissipated by lossy environment. In this work, we demonstrate that a quantum advantage in estimate precision can still be achieved in the presence of photon loss. This is accomplished by optimizing the weights of the multi-mode NOON states according to photon loss rates in the multiple modes, including the reference mode which defines the other phases. For practical relevance, we also show that photon-number counting via a multi-mode beam-splitter achieves the useful, albeit sub-optimal, quantum advantage. We expect this work to provide valuable guidance for developing quantum-enhanced multiple-phase estimation techniques in lossy environments.</description>

Abstract: Cat-state qubits formed by photonic cat states have a biased noise channel, i.e., one type of error dominates over all the others. We demonstrate that such biased-noise qubits are also promising for error-tolerant simulations of the quantum Rabi model (and its varieties) by coupling a cat-state qubit to an optical cavity. Using the cat-state qubit can effectively enhance the counter-rotating coupling, allowing us to explore several fascinating quantum phenomena relying on the counter-rotating interaction. Moreover, another benefit from biased-noise cat qubits is that the two main error channels (frequency and amplitude mismatches) are both exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the simulation protocols are robust against parameter errors of the parametric drive which determines the projection subspace. We analyze three examples: (i) collapse and revivals of quantum states; (ii) hidden symmetry and tunneling dynamics; and (iii) pair-cat-code computation.</description>

Abstract: A Normalizing Flow computes a bijective mapping from an arbitrary distribution to a predefined (e.g. normal) distribution. Such a flow can be used to address different tasks, e.g. anomaly detection, once such a mapping has been learned. In this work we introduce Normalizing Flows for Quantum architectures, describe how to model and optimize such a flow and evaluate our method on example datasets. Our proposed models show competitive performance for anomaly detection compared to classical methods, esp. those ones where there are already quantum inspired algorithms available. In the experiments we compare our performance to isolation forests (IF), the local outlier factor (LOF) or single-class SVMs.</description>

      <title>Memory in quantum processes with indefinite time direction and causal order</title>

Abstract: We examine the emergence of dynamical memory effects in quantum processes having indefinite time direction and causal order. In particular, we focus on the class of phase-covariant qubit channels, which encompasses some of the most significant paradigmatic open quantum system models. In order to assess the memory in the time evolution of the system, we utilize the trace distance and the entanglement based measures of non-Markovianity. While the indefinite time direction is obtained through the quantum time flip operation that realizes a coherent superposition of forward and backward processes, the indefinite causal order is achieved via the quantum switch map, which implements two quantum processes in a coherent superposition of their two possible orders. Considering various different families of phase-covariant qubit channels, we demonstrate that, when implemented on memoryless quantum processes, both the quantum time flip and the quantum switch operations can generate memory effects in the dynamics according to the trace distance based measure under certain conditions. On the other hand, with respect to the entanglement based measure, we show that neither the quantum time flip nor the quantum switch could induce dynamical memory for any of the considered phase-covariant channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\bf{g}$ tensor, which determines the reaction of Kramers-degenerate states to an applied magnetic field, is of increasing importance in the current design of spin qubits. It is affected by details of heterostructure composition, disorder, and electric fields, but it inherits much of its structure from the effect of the spin-orbit interaction working at the crystal-lattice level. Here we uncover new symmetry and topological features of $\bf{g}=\bf{g}_L+\bf{g}_S$ for important valence and conduction bands in silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide. For all crystals with high (cubic) symmetry, we show that large departures from the nonrelativistic value $g=2$ are guaranteed by symmetry. In particular, considering the spin part $\bf{g}_S(\bf{k})$, we prove that the scalar function $det(\bf{g}_S(\bf{k}))$ must go to zero on closed surfaces in the Brillouin zone, no matter how weak the spin-orbit coupling is. We also prove that for wave vectors $\bf{k}$ on these surfaces, the Bloch states $|u_{n\bf{k}}\rangle$ have maximal spin-orbital entanglement. Using tight-binding calculations, we observe that the surfaces $det(\bf{g}(\bf{k}))=0$ exhibit many interesting topological features, exhibiting Lifshitz critical points as understood in Fermi-surface theory.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for embedding continuous variables into quantum circuits via piecewise polynomial features, utilizing low-rank tensor networks. Our approach, termed Piecewise Polynomial Tensor Network Quantum Feature Encoding (PPTNQFE), aims to broaden the applicability of quantum algorithms by incorporating spatially localized representations suited for numerical applications like partial differential equations and function regression. We demonstrate the potential of PPTNQFE through efficient point evaluations of solutions of discretized differential equations and in modeling functions with localized features such as jump discontinuities. While promising, challenges such as unexplored noise impact and design of trainable circuits remain. This study opens new avenues for enhancing quantum models with novel feature embeddings and leveraging TN representations for a wider array of function types in quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations establish the fundamental trade-off between precision and thermodynamic costs, yet their empirical verification is scarce. To extend the range of real-world tests, we present an approach that utilizes a noisy quantum computer for verifying a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We employ a three-fold methodology to tackle the limitations of current quantum processors: generalizing a thermodynamic uncertainty relation to arbitrary observables under completely positive trace-preserving maps, proposing a method to measure the thermodynamic cost (survival activity) in the weak coupling regime, and reducing the required circuit depth by exploiting the properties of our thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We apply our bound to a quantum time correlator measurement protocol on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor. The empirical results show that our bound tightly constrains precision, with the relative variance approaching the theoretical limit within a single order of magnitude. Furthermore, our approach enables the saturation of our thermodynamic uncertainty relation by constructing the optimal observable that requires entangled measurements. This study highlights the potential and limitations of noisy quantum computers for demonstrating quantum thermodynamic trade-offs.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear quantum photonics serves as a cornerstone in photonic quantum technologies, such as universal quantum computing and quantum communications. The emergence of integrated photonics platform not only offers the advantage of large-scale manufacturing but also provides a variety of engineering methods. Given the complexity of integrated photonics engineering, a comprehensive simulation framework is essential to fully harness the potential of the platform. In this context, we introduce a nonlinear quantum photonics simulation framework which can accurately model a variety of features such as adiabatic waveguide, material anisotropy, linear optics components, photon losses, and detectors. Furthermore, utilizing the framework, we have developed a device scheme, chip-scale temporal walk-off compensation, that is useful for various quantum information processing tasks. Applying the simulation framework, we show that the proposed device scheme can enhance the squeezing parameter of photon-pair sources and the conversion efficiency of quantum frequency converters without relying on higher pump power.</description>

      <title>Some consequences of Sica's approach to Bell's inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Louis Sica derived Bell's inequalities from the hypothesis that the time series of outcomes observed in one station does not change if the setting in the other (distant) station is changed. This derivation is based on arithmetical properties only. It does not involve the controversial definitions of Locality and Realism, it does not require the definition of probabilities, and is valid for series of any length. In this paper, Sica's approach is extended to series with non ideal efficiency and to the actual time structure of experimental data. The first extension leads to an interesting relationship, involving the entanglement parameter SCHSH and efficiency, that places the so-called 'detection loophole' under new light. The second extension makes visible that measuring with different settings unavoidably means recording series at different times. It replaces 'Local Realism' (as the assumption necessary for the validity of Bell's inequalities), with the assumption that the recorded series can be arbitrarily reordered. Violation of this latter assumption is, in my opinion, more acceptable to intuition than violation of Local Realism. The second extension also shows that the observation of a violation of Bell's inequalities implies that Sica's hypothesis is not valid, i.e., that the series in one station is different if the setting in the other station is changed. This result gives precise meaning to 'quantum non-locality', and also explains why it cannot be used for sending messages. Finally, it is demonstrated that a series of outcomes, even if it violates Bell's inequalities, can be always embedded in a set of factual and counter-factual data in which Sica's hypothesis is valid. In consequence, factual universe may be quantum (non-classical) or not, but the union of factual and counter-factual universes is always classical.</description>

      <title>Optimal Layout Synthesis for Deep Quantum Circuits on NISQ Processors with 100+ Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layout synthesis is mapping a quantum circuit to a quantum processor. SWAP gate insertions are needed for scheduling 2-qubit gates only on connected physical qubits. With the ever-increasing number of qubits in NISQ processors, scalable layout synthesis is of utmost importance. With large optimality gaps observed in heuristic approaches, scalable exact methods are needed. While recent exact and near-optimal approaches scale to moderate circuits, large deep circuits are still out of scope.
  In this work, we propose a SAT encoding based on parallel plans that apply 1 SWAP and a group of CNOTs at each time step. Using domain-specific information, we maintain optimality in parallel plans while scaling to large and deep circuits. From our results, we show the scalability of our approach which significantly outperforms leading exact and near-optimal approaches (up to 100x). For the first time, we can optimally map several 8, 14, and 16 qubit circuits onto 54, 80, and 127 qubit platforms with up to 17 SWAPs. While adding optimal SWAPs, we also report near-optimal depth in our mapped circuits.</description>

Abstract: Unitary operators are employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The ensuing modifications affecting both classical and quantum bounds are elucidated. The relevance of a particular class of unitary operators whose expectation values are real is pointed out. For these operators, the classical and quantum bounds remain unaltered, being given, respectively, by $2$ and $2\sqrt{2}$. As an example, the Weyl unitary operators for a real scalar field in relativistic Quantum Field Theory are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the piecemeal quantum telescope through bit-by-bit iteration using different baselines. It improves precision exponentially with number of baselines, and it works robustly under large observation errors such as statistical errors, channel noise, operational errors and so on. For example, under the noisy channel of random phase drifts, our method can provide an exponential precision provided that the detected data is not entirely noisy. Being fault tolerant to statistical error, it requests only a small number of incident single-photons in detecting the star angle with exponential precision. As a result, it requests to detect only a few hundreds of photons from the target star for a precision breaking classical limit by 4 to 5 magnitude orders. This demonstrates a super efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The space of quantum states can be endowed with a metric structure using the second order derivatives of the relative entropy, giving rise to the so-called Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov inner product. We explore its geometric properties on the submanifold of faithful, zero-displacement Gaussian states parameterised by their covariance matrices, deriving expressions for the geodesic equations, curvature tensors and scalar curvature. Our analysis suggests that the curvature of the manifold is strictly monotonic with respect to the von Neumann entropy, and thus can be interpreted as a measure of state uncertainty. This provides supporting evidence for the Petz conjecture in continuous variable systems.</description>

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the Lyapunov control technique for quantum systems, feedback-based quantum algorithms have been proposed for calculating the ground states of Hamiltonians. In this work, we consider extending these algorithms to tackle calculating excited states. Inspired by the weighted subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, we propose a novel weighted feedback-based quantum algorithm for excited state calculation. We show that depending on how we design the weights and the feedback law, we can prepare the $p$th excited state or lowest energy states up to the $p$th excited state. Through an application in quantum chemistry, we show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, evaluating its efficacy via numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a modulation transfer protocol to increase the detection sensitivity of a Rydberg RF receiver to fields out of resonance from the transition between Rydberg levels. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the control field used to create the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) signal. The nonlinear wave-mixing of the multi-component coupling laser and the probe laser transfers the modulation to the probe laser, which is used for RF-field detection. The measurements compare well with semi-classical simulations of atom-light interaction and show an improvement in the RF bandwidth of the sensor and an improved sensitivity of the response to weak fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a research program aimed at establishing relational foundations for relativistic quantum physics. Although the formalism is still under development, we believe it has matured enough to be shared with the broader scientific community. Our approach seeks to integrate Quantum Field Theory on curved backgrounds and scenarios with indefinite causality. Building on concepts from the operational approach to Quantum Reference Frames, we extend these ideas significantly. Specifically, we initiate the development of a general integration theory for operator-valued functions (quantum fields) with respect to positive operator-valued measures (quantum frames). This allows us to define quantum frames within the context of arbitrary principal bundles, replacing group structures. By considering Lorentz principal bundles, we enable a relational treatment of quantum fields on arbitrarily curved spacetimes. A form of indefinite spatiotemporality arises from quantum states in the context of frame bundles. This offers novel perspectives on the problem of reconciling principles of generally relativistic and quantum physics and on modelling gravitational fields sourced by quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying nonclassicality of mixed Fock states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of bosonic modes are important resources for quantum-enhanced technologies. Yet, quantifying nonclassicality of these states, in particular mixed states, can be a challenge. Here we present results of quantifying the nonclassicality of a bosonic mode in a mixed Fock state via the operational resource theory (ORT) measure [W. Ge, K. Jacobs, S. Asiri, M. Foss-Feig, and M. S. Zubairy, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023400 (2020)], which relates nonclassicality to metrological advantage. Generally speaking, evaluating the ORT measure for mixed states is challenging, since it involves finding a convex roof. However, we show that our problem can be reduced to a linear programming problem. By analyzing the results of numerical optimization, we are able to extract exact, analytical results for the case where three or four neighboring Fock states have nonzero population. Interestingly, we find that such a mode can be in distinct phases, depending on the populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how our method is generalizable to density matrices of higher ranks. Our findings suggests a viable method for evaluating nonclassicality of arbitrary mixed bosonic states and potentially for solving other convex roof optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: Diamond is a promising platform for quantum information processing as it can host highly coherent qubits that could allow for the construction of large quantum registers. A prerequisite for such devices is a coherent interaction between nitrogen vacancy (NV) electron spins. Entanglement between dipolar-coupled NV spin pairs has been demonstrated, but with a limited entanglement fidelity and its error sources have not been characterized. Here, we design and implement a robust, easy to implement entangling gate between NV spins in diamond and quantify the influence of multiple error sources on the gate performance. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record gate fidelity of $F=(96.0 \pm 2.5)$ % under ambient conditions. Our identification of the dominant errors paves the way towards NV-NV gates beyond the error correction threshold.</description>

      <title>Phase estimation via number-conserving operation inside the SU(1,1) interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing nonlinear elements, SU(1,1) interferometers demonstrate superior phase sensitivity compared to passive interferometers. However, the precision is significantly impacted by photon losses, particularly internal losses. We propose a theoretical scheme to improve the precision of phase measurement using homodyne detection by implementing number-conserving operations (PA-then-PS and PS-then-PA) within the SU(1,1) interferometer, with the coherent state and the vacuum state as the input states. We analyze the effects of number-conserving operations on the phase sensitivity, the quantum Fisher information, and the quantum Cramer-Rao bound under both ideal and photon losses scenarios. Our findings reveal that the internal non-Gaussian operations can enhance the phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information, and effectively improve the robustness of the SU(1,1) interferometer against internal photon losses. Notably, the PS-then-PA scheme exhibits superior improvement in both ideal and photon losses cases in terms of phase sensitivity. Moreover, in the ideal case, PA-then-PS scheme slightly outperforms PS-then-PA scheme in terms of the quantum Fisher information and the Quantum Cramer-Rao. However, in the presence of photon losses, PS-then-PA scheme demonstrates a greater advantage.</description>

      <title>KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search</title>

Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS focus on machine learning-based approaches from reinforcement learning, like deep Q-network. While multi-layer perceptron-based deep Q-networks have been applied for QAS, their interpretability remains challenging due to the high number of parameters. In this work, we evaluate the practicality of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in QAS problems, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success and the number of optimal quantum circuit configurations to generate the multi-qubit maximally entangled states are $2\times$ to $5\times$ higher than Multi-Layer perceptions (MLPs). Moreover, in noisy scenarios, KAN can achieve a better fidelity in approximating maximally entangled state than MLPs, where the performance of the MLP significantly depends on the choice of activation function. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) with a KAN structure instead of the traditional MLP. This modification allows us to design a parameterized quantum circuit that contains fewer 2-qubit gates and has a shallower depth, thereby improving the efficiency of finding the ground state of a chemical Hamiltonian. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.</description>

Abstract: Two-party secure quantum remote sensing (SQRS) protocols enable quantum-enhanced measurements at remote locations with guaranteed security against eavesdroppers. This idea can be scaled up to networks of nodes where one party can directly measure functions of parameters at the different nodes using entangled states. However, the security on such networks decreases exponentially with the number of nodes. Here we show how this problem can be overcome in a hybrid protocol that utilises both entangled and separable states to achieve quantum-enhanced measurement precision and security on networks of any size.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Quantum Support Vector Machines for Cross-Domain Classification of Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we use cross-domain classification using quantum machine learning for quantum advantages to readdress the entanglement versus separability paradigm. The inherent structure of quantum states and its relation to a particular class of quantum states are used to intuitively classify testing states from domains different from training states, called \textit{cross-domain classification}. Using our quantum machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate efficient classifications of two-qubit mixed states into entangled and separable classes. For analyzing the quantumness of correlations, our model adequately classifies Bell diagonal states as zero and non-zero discord states. In addition, we also extend our analysis to evaluate the robustness of our model using random local unitary transformations. Our results demonstrate the potential of the quantum support vector machine for classifying quantum states across the multi-dimensional Hilbert space in comparison to classical support vector machines and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Suppression of noise in separation estimation of optical sources with spatial-mode demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial mode demultiplexing was proved to be a successful tool for estimation of the separation between incoherent sources, allowing for sensitivity much below the Rayleigh limit. However, with the presence of measurement's noise, superresolution brought by this technique deteriorates rapidly. On a formal ground, this can be seen in terms of, so called, Rayleigh curse known from direct imaging, which while being absent for ideal spatial mode demultiplexing, goes back in a noisy scenario. In this article, we develop a formal procedure to suppress the destructive effect of the noise, proposing a procedure effectively working as an error correction. For noise models given by a random unitary channel generated by a polynomial of creation and annihilation operators, we demonstrate that perfect noise decoupling can be reached by repeating the mode demultiplexers and intervening them by a group of rotations, in the limit of a large number of repetitions and small noise strength. For a special case of displacement noise, our solution is simplified: by using the demultiplexer twice, and interlacing it by a parity operator, given that the noise configuration is frozen between the first and the second step, a perfect decoupling can be achieved. This allows for a recovery of superresolution for a special class of noise generated by displacement operators. Furthermore, for a strong noise correlation between these two steps, our protocol provides an improved measurement resolution.</description>

Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>A Sound and Complete Equational Theory for 3-Qubit Toffoli-Hadamard Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a sound and complete equational theory for 3-qubit quantum circuits over the Toffoli-Hadamard gate set $\{ X, CX, CCX, H \}$. That is, we introduce a collection of true equations among Toffoli-Hadamard circuits on three qubits that is sufficient to derive any other true equation between such circuits. To obtain this equational theory, we first consider circuits over the Toffoli-$K$ gate set $\{ X, CX, CCX, K \}$, where $K=H\otimes H$. The Toffoli-Hadamard and Toffoli-$K$ gate sets appear similar, but they are crucially different on exactly three qubits. Indeed, in this case, the former generates an infinite group of operators, while the latter generates the finite group of automorphisms of the well-known $E_8$ lattice. We take advantage of this fact, and of the theory of automorphism groups of lattices, to obtain a sound and complete collection of equations for Toffoli-$K$ circuits. We then extend this equational theory to one for Toffoli-Hadamard circuits by leveraging prior work of Li et al. on Toffoli-Hadamard operators.</description>

      <title>Uhlmann quench and geometric dynamic quantum phase transition of mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) following quantum quenches exhibit singular behavior of the overlap between the initial and evolved states. Here we present a formalism to incorporate a geometric phase into quench dynamics of mixed quantum states, a process named the Uhlmann quench, based on the Uhlmann parallel transport. To overcome the incompatibility between the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition and Hamiltonian dynamics, we formulate the evolution of purification of the density matrix in a form which not only respects the dynamics according to the density matrix but also follows the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition to generate a geometric phase after a quantum quench. For cyclic processes exemplified by a spin-1/2 system, geometric DQPTs (GDQPTs) can emerge with both singular behavior in the dynamic analogue of the free energy and jumps of the geometric phase. Moreover, the Uhlmann phase reflecting the holonomy is generated at the end of each cycle. The Uhlmann quench thus paves the way for investigating the interplay between quantum dynamics and geometric processes in mixed states.</description>

Abstract: Single-pixel cameras are effective solution for imaging outside the visible spectrum where traditional CMOS/CCD cameras have challenges. Combined with machine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical applications. Solving the problem of high-dimensional single-pixel visualization can potentially be accelerated using quantum machine learning, thereby expanding the range of practical problems. In this work we simulated a single-pixel imaging experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset were used as objects. There were selected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6% of the number of pixels in the image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstruction images based on these measurements using classical fully connected neural networks and parameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed accuracies of 96% and 95% respectively after 6 training epochs, which is quite competitive result. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical and quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs, the structural similarity index measure values were 0.76 and 0.25, respectively, which indicates that the problem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural networks in such a configuration for now.</description>

Abstract: Characterization of quantum states and devices is paramount to quantum science and technology. The characterization consists of individual measurements, which are required to be precisely known. A mismatch between actual and assumed constituent measurements limits the accuracy of this characterization. Here, we show that such a mismatch introduces reconstruction artifacts in quantum state tomography. We use these artifacts to detect and quantify the mismatch and gain information about the actual measurement operators. It consequently allows the mitigation of systematic errors in quantum measurement and state preparation.</description>

Abstract: Amidst the array of quantum machine learning algorithms, the quantum kernel method has emerged as a focal point, primarily owing to its compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and its promise to achieve quantum advantage. This method operates by nonlinearly transforming data into feature space constructed with quantum states, enabling classification and regression tasks. In this study, we present a novel feature space constructed using Kerr coherent states, which generalize su(2), su(1, 1) coherent states, and squeezed states. Notably, the feature space exhibits constant curvature, comprising both spherical and hyperbolic geometries, depending on the sign of the Kerr parameter. Remarkably, the physical parameters associated with the coherent states, enable control over the curvature of the feature space. Our study employs Kerr kernels derived from encoding data into the phase and amplitude of Kerr coherent states. We analyze various datasets ranging from Moon to breast cancer diagnostics. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of Kerr coherent states, attributed to their flexibility in accommodating different hyperparameters, thereby offering superior performance across noisy datasets and hardware setups.</description>

Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) addresses combinatorial optimization challenges by converting inputs to graphs. However, the optimal parameter searching process of QAOA is greatly affected by noise. Larger problems yield bigger graphs, requiring more qubits and making their outcomes highly noise-sensitive. This paper introduces Red-QAOA, leveraging energy landscape concentration via a simulated annealing-based graph reduction.
  Red-QAOA creates a smaller (distilled) graph with nearly identical parameters to the original graph. The distilled graph produces a smaller quantum circuit and thus reduces noise impact. At the end of the optimization, Red-QAOA employs the parameters from the distilled graph on the original graph and continues the parameter search on the original graph. Red-QAOA outperforms state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based pooling techniques on 3200 real-world problems. Red-QAOA reduced node and edge counts by 28% and 37%, respectively, with a mean square error of only 2%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.06680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to decompose real multivariate polynomials while preserving invariance and positivity. This framework has been recently introduced for tensor decompositions, in particular for quantum many-body systems. Here we transfer results about decomposition structures, invariance under permutations of variables, positivity, rank inequalities and separations, approximations, and undecidability to real polynomials. Specifically, we define invariant decompositions of polynomials and characterize which polynomials admit such decompositions. We then include positivity: We define invariant separable and sum-of-squares decompositions, and characterize the polynomials similarly. We provide inequalities and separations between the ranks of the decompositions, and show that the separations are not robust with respect to approximations. For cyclically invariant decompositions, we show that it is undecidable whether the polynomial is nonnegative or sum-of-squares for all system sizes. Our work sheds new light on polynomials by putting them on an equal footing with tensors, and opens the door to extending this framework to other tensor product structures.</description>

Abstract: Treating the nonlinear term of the Gross-Pitaevskii nonlinear Schrodinger equation as a perturbation of an isolated discrete eigenvalue of the linear problem one obtains a Rayleigh-Schrodinger power series. This power series is proved to be convergent when the parameter representing the intensity of the nonlinear term is less in absolute value than a threshold value, and it gives a stationary solution to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model is explored by combining the quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic parameter optimization, specifically achieved by tuning correlation ratios so that space and imaginary time are isotropic.
  In our simulations, the simulator automatically determines the parameters to sample from, even without prior knowledge of the critical point and universality class.
  The leading order finite-size corrections are eliminated by comparing two systems with different sizes; this procedure is also performed automatically.
  Varying the decay exponent of the long-range interaction, \(\sigma\), we investigate \(\sigma\)-dependence of the dynamical exponent and the other critical exponents precisely in the mean-field, non-universal, and two-dimensional classical Ising universality regimes.
  We successfully determine the universality boundary between the latter two as \(\sigma = 7/4\) based on the dynamical exponent and settle a long-standing dispute on the location of the universality boundary.</description>

      <title>Classification and magic magnetic-field directions for spin-orbit-coupled double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin of a single electron confined in a semiconductor quantum dot is a natural qubit candidate. Fundamental building blocks of spin-based quantum computing have been demonstrated in double quantum dots with significant spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that spin-orbit-coupled double quantum dots can be categorised in six classes, according to a partitioning of the multi-dimensional space of their $g$-tensors. The class determines physical characteristics of the double dot, i.e., features in transport, spectroscopy and coherence measurements, as well as qubit control, shuttling, and readout experiments. In particular, we predict that the spin physics is highly simplified due to pseudospin conservation, whenever the external magnetic field is pointing to special directions (`magic directions'), where the number of special directions is determined by the class. We also analyze the existence and relevance of magic loops in the space of magnetic-field directions, corresponding to equal local Zeeman splittings. These results present an important step toward precise interpretation and efficient design of spin-based quantum computing experiments in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bias Assisted Annealing of Amorphous Oxide Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Casimir effect in an expanding ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is a macroscopic evidence of the quantum nature of the vacuum. On a ring, it leads to a finite size correction to the vacuum energy. In this work, we show that this vacuum's energy and pressure acquire additional, sizable corrections, when the ring's radius is increased fast enough, an experimentally accessible model of an expanding universe. This effect is distinct from the dynamical Casimir effect: it is a manifestation of the conformal anomaly, originating from the spacetime curvature induced by the increase of the ring's radius. This anomalous dynamical Casimir effect is measurable through the work necessary to increase the ring size, which becomes non-monotonous in time.</description>

      <title>Multi-axis inertial sensing with 2D arrays of matter waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are an exquisite measurement tool for inertial forces. However, they are commonly limited to one single sensitive axis, allowing high-precision multi-dimensional sensing only through subsequent or postcorrected measurements. Here, we introduce a novel 2D-array-arrangement of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) initialized utilizing time-averaged optical potentials for simultaneous multi-axis inertial sensing. Deploying a 3 x 3 BEC array covering 1.6 mm^2, we perform measurements of angular velocity and acceleration of a rotating reference mirror, as well as a linear acceleration, e.g., induced by gravity, gradients, and higher order derivatives. We anticipate increased sensitivity of our method in interferometers with large scale factors in long-baseline or satellite atom interferometry. Our work paves the way for simple high-precision multi-axis inertial sensing and we envision further applications, e.g., for three-dimensional wave front characterization.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

      <title>Hidden zero modes and topology of multiband non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has lead to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization conditions and full transseries structures for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric anharmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin analysis (EWKB) for a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics (QM) defined by the potential that $V_{\cal PT}(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^{2 K} (i x)^{\varepsilon}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R}_{&gt;0}$ and $K, \varepsilon \in {\mathbb N}$ to clarify its perturbative/non-perturbative structure. In our analysis, we mainly consider the massless cases, i.e., $\omega = 0$, and derive the exact quantization conditions (QCs) for arbitrary $(K,\varepsilon)$ including all perturbative/non-perturbative corrections. From the exact QCs, we clarify full transseries structure of the energy spectra with respect to the inverse energy level expansion, and then formulate the Gutzwiller trace formula, the spectral summation form, and the Euclidean path-integral. For the massive cases, i.e., $\omega &gt; 0$, we show the fact that, by requiring existence of solution of the exact QCs, the path of analytic continuation in EWKB is uniquely determined for a given $N = 2K + \varepsilon$, and in consequence the exact QCs, the energy spectra, and the three formulas are all perturbative. Similarities to Hermitian QMs and resurgence are also discussed as additional remarks.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by infinite-component Chern-Simons theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D ``Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'' can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Motivated by the present field-theoretical work, it will be interesting to construct 3D lattice models for demonstrating Toeplitz braiding, which is left to future investigation.</description>

      <title>A frame-bundle formulation of quantum reference frames: from superposition of perspectives to superposition of geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a possible fully geometric formulation of the core idea of quantum reference frames (QRFs) as it has been applied in the context of gravity, freeing its definition from unnecessary (though convenient) ingredients, such as coordinate systems. Our formulation is based on two main ideas. First, a QRF encodes uncertainty about what is the observer's (and, hence, the measuring apparatus's) perception of time and space at each spacetime point (i.e., event). For this, an observer at an event $p$ is modeled, as usual, as a tetrad in the tangent space $T_p$. So a QRF at an event $p$ is a complex function on the tetrads at $p$. Second, we use the result that one can specify a metric on a given manifold by stipulating that a basis one assigns at each tangent space is to be a tetrad in the metric one wants to specify. Hence a spacetime, i.e. manifold plus metric, together with a choice of "point of view" on it, is represented by a section of the bundle of bases, understood as taking the basis assigned to each point to be a tetrad. Thus a superposition of spacetimes gets represented as, roughly speaking, an assignment of complex amplitudes to sections of this bundle. A QRF, defined here as the collection of complex amplitudes assigned to bases at events--i.e., a complex function defined on the bundle of bases of the manifold--can describe, in a local way (i.e., attributing the amplitudes to bases at events instead of to whole sections), these superpositions.
  We believe that this formulation sheds some light on some conceptual aspects and possible extensions of current ideas about QRFs. For instance, thinking in geometric terms makes it clear that the idea of QRFs applied to the gravitational scenarios treated in the literature (beyond linear approximation) lacks predictive power due to arbitrariness which, we argue, can only be resolved by some further input from physics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this letter, we propose to realize the tricritical Ising transition with Rydberg atom arrays, taking advantage of the reconfigurability of these systems. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we utilize the analog--digital hybrid nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which can simulate a physical Hamiltonian and perform a digital quantum circuit on the same platform, to measure the correlation function of the fermionic mode. This hybridized protocol provides an experimentally feasible way to reveal the hidden structure of the spacetime SUSY that emerges at the tricritical Ising transition.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Wannier Localizability and Detachable Topological Boundary States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>
