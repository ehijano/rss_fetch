      <title>Efficient Preference Elicitation in Iterative Combinatorial Auctions with Many Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of achieving high efficiency in iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). ICAs are a kind of combinatorial auction where the auctioneer interacts with bidders to gather their valuation information using a limited number of queries, aiming for efficient allocation. Preference elicitation, a process that incrementally asks bidders to value bundles while refining the outcome allocation, is a commonly used technique in ICAs. Recently, the integration of machine learning (ML) into ICAs has significantly improved preference elicitation. This approach employs ML models that match the number of bidders, estimating each bidder's valuation functions based on their reported valuations. However, most current studies train a separate model for each bidder, which can be inefficient when there are numerous bidders with similar valuation functions and a limited number of available queries. In this study, we introduce a multi-task learning method to learn valuation functions more efficiently. Specifically, we propose to share model parameters during training to grasp the intrinsic relationships between valuations. We assess the performance of our method using a spectrum auction simulator. The findings demonstrate that our method achieves higher efficiency than existing methods, especially in scenarios with many bidders and items but a limited number of maximum queries.</description>

      <title>Gamu Blue: A Practical Tool for Game Theory Security Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of game theory in cybersecurity enables strategic analysis, adversarial modeling, and optimal decision-making to address security threats' complex and dynamic nature. Previous studies by Abraham et al. and Bi\c{c}er et al. presented various definitions of equilibria to examine the security aspects of games involving multiple parties. Nonetheless, these definitions lack practical and easy-to-use implementations. Our primary contribution is addressing this gap by developing Gamu Blue, an easy-to-use tool with implementations for computing the equilibria definitions including k-resiliency, l-repellence, t-immunity, (l, t)-resistance, and m-stability.</description>

      <title>Detecting and taking Project Interactions into account in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce models and algorithms for the Participatory Budgeting problem when projects can interact with each other. In this problem, the objective is to select a set of projects that fits in a given budget. Voters express their preferences over the projects and the goal is then to find a consensus set of projects that does not exceed the budget. Our goal is to detect such interactions thanks to the preferences expressed by the voters. Through the projects selected by the voters, we detect positive and negative interactions between the projects by identifying projects that are consistently chosen together. In presence of project interactions, it is preferable to select projects that interact positively rather than negatively, all other things being equal. We introduce desirable properties that utility functions should have in presence of project interactions and we build a utility function which fulfills the desirable properties introduced. We then give axiomatic properties of aggregation rules, and we study three classical aggregation rules: the maximization of the sum of the utilities, of the product of the utilities, or of the minimal utility. We show that in the three cases the problems solved by these rules are NP-hard, and we propose a branch and bound algorithm to solve them. We conclude the paper by experiments.</description>

      <title>Ordering Collective Unit Tasks: from Scheduling to Computational Social Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective schedules problem, which consists in computing a one machine schedule of a set of tasks, knowing that a set of individuals (also called voters) have preferences regarding the order of the execution of the tasks. Our aim is to return a consensus schedule. We consider the setting in which all tasks have the same length -- such a schedule can therefore also be viewed as a ranking. We study two rules, one based on a distance criterion, and another one based one a binary criterion, and we show that these rules extend classic scheduling criteria. We also consider time constraints and precedence constraints between the tasks, and focus on two cases: the preferences of the voters fulfill these constraints, or they do not fulfill these constraints (but the collective schedule should fulfill them). In each case, either we show that the problem is NP-hard, or we provide a polynomial time algorithm which solves it. We also provide an analysis of a heuristic, which appears to be a 2 approximation of the Spearman's rule.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Dilemma Games in Distribution Information Using Interplay of Droop Quota: Meek's Method in Impact of Maximum Compensation and Minimum Cost Routes in Information Role of Marginal Contribution in Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a preliminary report of the research plan and a digest of the results and discussions. On research note explores the complex dynamics of fake news dissemination and fact-checking costs within the framework of information markets and analyzes the equilibrium between supply and demand using the concepts of droop quotas, Meek's method, and marginal contributions. By adopting a two-sided matching market perspective, we delve into scenarios in which markets are stable under the influence of fake news perceived as truth and those in which credibility prevails. Through the application of iterated dilemma game theory, we investigate the strategic choices of news providers affected by the costs associated with spreading fake news and fact-checking efforts. We further examine the maximum reward problem and strategies to minimize the cost path for spreading fake news, and consider a nuanced understanding of market segmentation into "cheap" and "premium" segments based on the nature of the information being spread. Our analysis uses mathematical models and computational processes to identify stable equilibrium points that ensure market stability in the face of deceptive information practices and provide insight into effective strategies to enhance the informational health of the market. Through this comprehensive approach, this paper aims for a more truthful and reliable perspective from which to observe information markets.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Powered Combinatorial Clock Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). The main challenge in this domain is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this, several papers have recently proposed machine learning (ML)-based preference elicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most important information from bidders. However, from a practical point of view, the main shortcoming of this prior work is that those designs elicit bidders' preferences via value queries (i.e., ``What is your value for the bundle $\{A,B\}$?''). In most real-world ICA domains, value queries are considered impractical, since they impose an unrealistically high cognitive burden on bidders, which is why they are not used in practice. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by designing an ML-powered combinatorial clock auction that elicits information from the bidders only via demand queries (i.e., ``At prices $p$, what is your most preferred bundle of items?''). We make two key technical contributions: First, we present a novel method for training an ML model on demand queries. Second, based on those trained ML models, we introduce an efficient method for determining the demand query with the highest clearing potential, for which we also provide a theoretical foundation. We experimentally evaluate our ML-based demand query mechanism in several spectrum auction domains and compare it against the most established real-world ICA: the combinatorial clock auction (CCA). Our mechanism significantly outperforms the CCA in terms of efficiency in all domains, it achieves higher efficiency in a significantly reduced number of rounds, and, using linear prices, it exhibits vastly higher clearing potential. Thus, with this paper we bridge the gap between research and practice and propose the first practical ML-powered ICA.</description>

      <title>The Danger Of Arrogance: Welfare Equilibra As A Solution To Stackelberg Self-Play In Non-Coincidental Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of multi-agent learning systems in society necessitates understanding how to learn effective and safe policies in general-sum multi-agent environments against a variety of opponents, including self-play. General-sum learning is difficult because of non-stationary opponents and misaligned incentives. Our first main contribution is to show that many recent approaches to general-sum learning can be derived as approximations to Stackelberg strategies, which suggests a framework for developing new multi-agent learning algorithms. We then define non-coincidental games as games in which the Stackelberg strategy profile is not a Nash Equilibrium. This notably includes several canonical matrix games and provides a normative theory for why existing algorithms fail in self-play in such games. We address this problem by introducing Welfare Equilibria (WE) as a generalisation of Stackelberg Strategies, which can recover desirable Nash Equilibria even in non-coincidental games. Finally, we introduce Welfare Function Search (WelFuSe) as a practical approach to finding desirable WE against unknown opponents, which finds more mutually desirable solutions in self-play, while preserving performance against naive learning opponents.</description>
