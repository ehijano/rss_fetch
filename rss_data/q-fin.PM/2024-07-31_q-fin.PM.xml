      <title>Designing Time-Series Models With Hypernetworks &amp; Adversarial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes the methods that achieved 4th and 6th place in the forecasting and investment challenges, respectively, of the M6 competition, ultimately securing the 1st place in the overall duathlon ranking. In the forecasting challenge, we tested a novel meta-learning model that utilizes hypernetworks to design a parametric model tailored to a specific family of forecasting tasks. This approach allowed us to leverage similarities observed across individual forecasting tasks while also acknowledging potential heterogeneity in their data generating processes. The model's training can be directly performed with backpropagation, eliminating the need for reliance on higher-order derivatives and is equivalent to a simultaneous search over the space of parametric functions and their optimal parameter values. The proposed model's capabilities extend beyond M6, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art meta-learning methods in the sinusoidal regression task and outperforming conventional parametric models on time-series from the M4 competition. In the investment challenge, we adjusted portfolio weights to induce greater or smaller correlation between our submission and that of other participants, depending on the current ranking, aiming to maximize the probability of achieving a good rank.</description>

      <title>Inferring financial stock returns correlation from complex network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial stock returns correlations have been studied in the prism of random matrix theory, to distinguish the signal from the "noise". Eigenvalues of the matrix that are above the rescaled Marchenko Pastur distribution can be interpreted as collective modes behavior while the modes under are usually considered as noise. In this analysis we use complex network analysis to simulate the "noise" and the "market" component of the return correlations, by introducing some meaningful correlations in simulated geometric Brownian motion for the stocks. We find that the returns correlation matrix is dominated by stocks with high eigenvector centrality and clustering found in the network. We then use simulated "market" random walks to build an optimal portfolio and find that the overall return performs better than using the historical mean-variance data, up to 50% on short time scale.</description>

      <title>The Elasticity of Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest according to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models? Thirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in contrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create elastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty of trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that aggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in the market.</description>
