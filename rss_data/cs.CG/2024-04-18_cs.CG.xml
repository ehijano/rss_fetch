      <title>GIRA: Gaussian Mixture Models for Inference and Robot Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00071v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the open-source framework, GIRA, which implements fundamental robotics algorithms for reconstruction, pose estimation, and occupancy modeling using compact generative models. Compactness enables perception in the large by ensuring that the perceptual models can be communicated through low-bandwidth channels during large-scale mobile robot deployments. The generative property enables perception in the small by providing high-resolution reconstruction capability. These properties address perception needs for diverse robotic applications, including multi-robot exploration and dexterous manipulation. State-of-the-art perception systems construct perceptual models via multiple disparate pipelines that reuse the same underlying sensor data, which leads to increased computation, redundancy, and complexity. GIRA bridges this gap by providing a unified perceptual modeling framework using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as well as a novel systems contribution, which consists of GPU-accelerated functions to learn GMMs 10-100x faster compared to existing CPU implementations. Because few GMM-based frameworks are open-sourced, this work seeks to accelerate innovation and broaden adoption of these techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Visibility-based Search in Polygonal Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a geometric domain $P$, visibility-based search problems seek routes for one or more mobile agents (``watchmen'') to move within $P$ in order to be able to see a portion (or all) of $P$, while optimizing objectives, such as the length(s) of the route(s), the size (e.g., area or volume) of the portion seen, the probability of detecting a target distributed within $P$ according to a prior distribution, etc. The classic watchman route problem seeks a shortest route for an observer, with omnidirectional vision, to see all of $P$. In this paper we study bicriteria optimization problems for a single mobile agent within a polygonal domain $P$ in the plane, with the criteria of route length and area seen. Specifically, we address the problem of computing a minimum length route that sees at least a specified area of $P$ (minimum length, for a given area quota). We also study the problem of computing a length-constrained route that sees as much area as possible. We provide hardness results and approximation algorithms. In particular, for a simple polygon $P$ we provide the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem of computing a shortest route seeing an area quota, as well as a (slightly more efficient) polynomial dual approximation. We also consider polygonal domains $P$ (with holes) and the special case of a planar domain consisting of a union of lines. Our results yield the first approximation algorithms for computing a time-optimal search route in $P$ to guarantee some specified probability of detection of a static target within $P$, randomly distributed in $P$ according to a given prior distribution.</description>

      <title>Spiral Complete Coverage Path Planning Based on Conformal Slit Mapping in Multi-connected Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of smoother and shorter spiral complete coverage paths in multi-connected domains is a crucial research topic in path planning for robotic cavity machining and other related fields. Traditional methods for spiral path planning in multi-connected domains typically incorporate a subregion division procedure that leads to excessive subregion bridging, requiring longer, more sharply turning, and unevenly spaced spirals to achieve complete coverage. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel spiral complete coverage path planning method using conformal slit mapping. It takes advantage of the fact that conformal slit mapping can transform multi-connected domains into regular disks or annuluses without the need for subregion division. Firstly, a slit mapping calculation technique is proposed for segmented cubic spline boundaries with corners. Secondly, a spiral path spacing control method is developed based on the maximum inscribed circle radius between adjacent conformal slit mapping iso-parameters. Thirdly, the spiral coverage path is derived by offsetting iso-parameters. Numerical experiments indicate that our method shares a comparable order of magnitude in computation time with the traditional PDE-based spiral complete coverage path method, but it excels in optimizing total path length, smoothness, and spacing consistency. Finally, we performed experiments on cavity milling and dry runs to compare the new method with the traditional PDE-based method in terms of machining duration and steering impact, respectively. The comparison reveals that, with both algorithms achieving complete coverage, the new algorithm reduces machining time and steering impact by 12.34% and 22.78%, respectively, compared with the traditional PDE-based method.</description>

      <title>Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes continuous-space methodologies to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient between an ellipsoidal robot model and an environment surface modeled as a set of Gaussian distributions. Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers</description>
