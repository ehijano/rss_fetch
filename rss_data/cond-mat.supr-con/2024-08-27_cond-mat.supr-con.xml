      <title>Superconductor to metal quantum phase transition with magnetic field in Josephson coupled lead islands on Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor-to-metal transition with magnetic field and gate-voltage is studied in a Josephson junction array comprising of randomly distributed lead islands on exfoliated single-layer graphene with a back-gate. The low magnetic-field superconductivity onset temperature is fitted to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory to model the temperature dependence of the upper critical field. The magnetoresistance in the intermediate temperature and field regime is described using thermally activated flux flow dictated by field dependent activation barrier. The barrier also depends on the gate voltage which dictates the inter-island Josephson coupling and disorder. The magnetoresistance near the upper critical field at low temperatures shows signatures of a gate dependent continuous quantum phase transition between superconductor and metal. The finite size scaling analysis shows that this transition belongs to the $(2+1)$D-XY universality class without disorder.</description>

      <title>Stability limits in two-band superconductor rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores transitions between states with different winding number in two-band superconducting rings. From the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations for two-component superconductors, we apply linear instability theory and develop a semi-analytical method that provides the critical flux for phase-slip occurrence. The developed method was applied to investigate how the critical flux depends on physical properties, such as band parameters and temperature. Finally, we show the possible existence of a soliton state, in which the phase winding number is different in each condensate.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric signature of quantum criticality in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeRhIn$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the Fermi surface across the quantum critical point (QCP), which is relevant for characterizing the quantum criticality and understanding its relation with unconventional superconductivity, is an intriguing subject in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this study, we report the thermopower measurements to investigate a change in Fermi surface across the QCP in pure and 4.4% Sn-doped CeRhIn$_5$. Results show that their thermopower behavior differs significantly in the vicinity of their respective pressure-induced QCP. In pure CeRhIn$_5$, a drastic collapse of the thermopower takes place at the Kondo breakdown QCP, where the Fermi surface reconstructs concurrently with the development of the magnetic order. By contrast, the thermopower exhibits a broadly symmetric behavior around the QCP in 4.4% Sn-doped CeRhIn$_5$, which is a characteristic of the spin-density-wave QCP. These observations are consistent with the theoretical expectations and suggest the effectiveness of thermopower measurement in discriminating the nature of quantum criticality in heavy-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>A toy model for 2-dimensional spin-fluctuation-induced unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity had been one of the most enigmatic phenomena in condensed matter physics, puzzling the best theorists for 45 years, since the original discovery by Kamerlingh-Onnes in 1911 till the final solution by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) in 1957. The original BCS proposal assumed the highest-symmetry form for the superconducting order parameter Delta, namely, a constant, and a uniform pairing interaction due to attractive mediation of ionic vibration. While it was rather soon realized that generalizations onto k-dependent order parameters and anisotropic pairing interaction was straightforward, only thirty years later, upon the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, high-order angular dependence of Delta and repulsive interaction, mediated by spin fluctuations or Coulomb repulsion brought such "unconventional" into the spotlight. In 2008 yet another such system was discovered, and eventually the idea of repulsion-mediated unconventional superconductivity was generally accepted. Apart from the two specific systems mentioned above, a large number of various specific implementations of this idea have been proposed, and it is becoming increasingly clear that it is worth studying mathematically how unconventional superconductivity emerges, and with what properties, for a simple, but sufficiently general theoretical model. In our project, we study systematically unconventional superconductivity in an isotropic two-dimensional model system of electrons, subjected to repulsive interactions of a simple, but physically motivated form: a Dirac-delta function peaked at a particular momentum (from 0 to twice the Fermi momentum), or Gaussian of varying widths.</description>

      <title>Pressure weakens coupling strength in In and Sn elemental superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure dependence of the thermodynamic critical field $B_{\rm c}$ in elemental indium (In) and tin (Sn) superconductors was studied by means of the muon-spin rotation/relaxation. Pressure enhances the deviation of $B_{\rm c}(T)$ from the parabolic behavior, expected for a typical type-I superconductor, suggesting a weakening of the coupling strengths $\alpha=\langle\Delta\rangle /k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ ($\langle\Delta\rangle$ is the average value of the superconducting energy gap, $T_{\rm c}$ is the transition temperature and $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant). As pressure increases from 0.0 to $\simeq 3.0$ GPa $\alpha$ decreases linearly, by approaching the limiting weak-coupling BCS value $\alpha_{\rm BCS}=1.764$. Analysis of the data within the framework of the Eliashberg theory reveals that only part of the pressure effect on $\alpha$ can be attributed to the effect of hardening of the phonon spectra, which is reflected by a decrease of the electron-phonon coupling constant. Nearly 40% of the effect is caused by increased anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap.</description>

      <title>Spin-triplet pair density wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the nonzero center of mass momentum pair density wave (PDW) is a widespread phenomenon observed over different superconducting materials. However, concrete theoretical model realizations of the PDW order have remained elusive. Here, we study a one-dimensional model with nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under generic spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully broken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a spatial dependent $\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair density wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of the phase diagram. The $\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch $Q_{\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is fully-gapped and a class-DIII topological superconductor with two Majorana zero modes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW superconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW detected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se) and potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection on a normal metal-superconductor junction may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity emerging along with the strange-metal behavior in UAs2 under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14334v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 with Tc = 2 K has attracted enormous attention because it possesses many interesting properties, such as the extremely high upper critical field Hc2(0), chiral superconductivity and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, etc., all these suggest that it may be the long-sought spin-triplet superconductor. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity up to Tc = 4K in one of its siblings, i.e., UAs2 under high pressures. Interestingly, the UAs2 shows metallic behavior with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at about 274 K under ambient pressure. Upon applying pressure, this transition is pushed down to lower temperatures with improved electric conductivity. When the pressure rises to about 20-22 GPa, superconductivity occurs together with the emergence of a linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance, the latter is a hallmark of the strange-metal state. The superconductivity with the highest Tc = 4 K is reached under a pressure of about 26.8 GPa, and it is robust against magnetic field with the upper critical field {\mu}0Hc2(0) ~ 12 T, far beyond the Pauli limit. Higher pressures will suppress the superconductivity and bring back the Fermi liquid behavior, showing a clear signature of quantum criticality. Our results open a new avenue for investigating the unconventional superconductivity concerning the mysterious 5f-band electrons in this uranium-based system.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Driven Transient Hydrogenation in Metal Superhydrides at Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, metal hydride research has become one of the driving forces of the high-pressure community, as it is believed to hold the key to superconductivity close to ambient temperature. While numerous novel metal hydride compounds have been reported and extensively investigated for their superconducting properties, little attention has been focused on the atomic and electronic states of hydrogen, the main ingredient in these novel compounds. Here, we present combined $^{1}H$- and $^{139}La$-NMR data on lanthanum superhydrides, $LaH_{x}$, ($x = 10.2 - 11.1$), synthesized after laser heating at pressures above 160 GPa. Strikingly, we found hydrogen to be in a highly diffusive state at room temperature, with diffusion coefficients in the order of $10^{-6}~cm^2s^{-1}$. We found that this diffusive state of hydrogen results in a dynamic de-hydrogenation of the sample over the course of several weeks, approaching a composition similar to its precursor materials. Quantitative measurements demonstrate that the synthesized superhydrides continuously decompose over time. Transport measurements underline this conclusion as superconducting critical temperatures were found to decrease significantly over time as well. This observation sheds new light on formerly unanswered questions on the long-term stability of metal superhydrides.</description>

Abstract: We numerically calculate the dynamic structure factor of the simplest two dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. This provides an important benchmark for future experiments which will explore the dynamics of such models. As would be expected, the spectrum is gapped away from the critical point, and can be understood in terms of the elementary excitations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and interactions in superconducting chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most studies of non-trivial topological systems are carried out in non-interacting models that admit an exact solution. This raises the question, to which extent the consideration of electronic correlations, present in real systems, modify these results. Exact solutions of correlated electronic systems with non-trivial topological properties, although fundamental are scarce. Among the non-interacting soluble models, we single out the Kitaev p-wave superconducting chain. It plays a crucial role in clarifying the appearance of emergent quasi-particles, the Majorana modes, associated with non-trivial topological properties. Given the relevance of this model, it would be extremely useful if it can be extended to include correlations and still remain solvable. In this work we investigate a superconducting Kitaev chain that interacts through a Falicov-Kimball Hamiltonian with a background of localized electrons. For some relevant values of the parameters of this extended model solutions can be obtained, which allows for a detailed study of the interplay between electronic correlations and non-trivial topological behavior. Besides, the random occupation of the chain by the local moments brings the new interesting effects associated with disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-II Dirac semimetals exhibit a unique Fermi surface topology, which allows them to host novel topological superconductivity (TSC). We reveal a novel inter-orbital superconducting state, corresponding to the B1u and B2u pairings under the D4h point group. Intriguingly, we find that both first- and second-order TSC coexist in this novel state. It is induced by a dominant inter-orbital attraction and possesses surface helical Majorana cones and hinge Majorana flat bands, spanning the entire z-directed hinge Brillouin zone. Further investigation uncovers that these higher-order hinge modes are robust against the C4z symmetry-breaking perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between substrates and superconducting thin films has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report an in-depth investigation on superconducting properties of the epitaxial TiN thin films grown on three different substrates by dc reactive magnetron sputtering. The TiN films grown on (0001) sapphire exhibit (111) crystal orientation, while that grown on (100) Si and MgO substrates exhibit (100) orientation. Moreover, the samples grown on Si reveal a relatively lower level of disorder, accompanied by the higher critical transition temperature $T_c$ and smaller magnitude of upper critical field slope near $T_c$. Remarkably, we uncovered a rather high value of superconducting gap (with $\Delta_0/k_BT_c$ = 3.05) in TiN film on Si indicating a very strong coupling superconductivity, in sharp contrast to the case using sapphires and MgO as the substrate which reveals a weak-coupling feature. The comprehensive analysis considering the scenarios of the three substrate shows that the grain size of the thin films may be an important factor influencing the superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We classify the magnetic ground states of a 2D lattice of localized magnetic moments which are coupled to a superconducting substrate with Rashba-spin-orbit coupling. We discover a rich magnetic phase diagram with surprisingly complex structures including 2q-spin-spirals, a 2x2-periodic pattern, and skyrmion lattices, self-consistently, using an effective classical spin Hamiltonian and show that the system hosts non-zero 4-spin interactions. Our in-depth analysis of about ten thousand magnetic configurations becomes feasible using contrastive clustering, a recent advanced unsupervised machine learning technique. This work proposes simple few-band systems for non-collinear magnetic states and stimulates further research on topological effects in their self-consistent electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Composite Structure of Single-Particle Spectral Function in Lightly-Doped Mott Insulators</title>

Abstract: The internal structure of doped holes in the Mott insulator may provide important insight into the physics of doped cuprates. Its observability via a single-particle probe by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) is explored in this paper. Specifically we study the single-particle spectral function based on a two-hole variational ground state wavefunction [Phys. Rev. X 12, 011062 (2022)] in the $t$-$J$ model. The latter as a strongly correlated state possesses a dichotomy of $d$-wave Cooper pairing and $s$-wave ``twisted'' hole pairing. This pairing structure will give rise to two branches of local spectral function at finite energies. The low-lying one corresponds to a nodal-like quasiparticle excitation and the higher branch is associated with the pair breaking of ``twisted'' quasiparticles, with the threshold energy resembling a pseudogap, which is consistent with the recent STS observation. It can be further extended into energy spectra in momentum space measurable by ARPES, where the low-energy dispersion is also shown to agree well with the Quantum Monte Carlo numerical result for a single hole. It implies that the dominant pairing force arises from the ``twisted'' holes showing up in the high-energy branch. The effect of the next nearest neighbor hopping integral $t'$ is also examined, which shows interesting distinction between $t'/t &gt; 0$ and $t'/t \leq 0$ with a dramatic shift of the low-lying excitation from the nodal region to the antinodal region, but with the high-energy branch remaining insensitive to $t'$. Finally, a possible ``orthogonality catastrophe'' effect, namely, a ``dark matter'' component in the strongly correlated wavefunction that cannot be directly detected by the single-electron spectroscopy, is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac Distribution in Persistent Current Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: (i) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; (ii) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>
