      <title>Supersymmetry in the Landau Level Problem with a Disorder Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a supersymmetric (SUSY) theory that arises in the Landau level problem with disorder. Charged particles in a strong magnetic field and a local potential are described by small excitations around the ground state, the lowest Landau level (LLL). Around forty years ago Br\'ezin, Gross and Itzykson showed that for a disorder potential certain observables in the LLL limit are described by a chiral SUSY theory. As a consequence, the problem undergoes a dimensional reduction by two dimensions, simplifying the computations. We generalize their findings by identifying the chiral SUSY as a special limit of a `magnetic Parisi-Sourlas (PS)' theory. The latter is a modification of the theories associated to fixed points of random field models. We show that the SUSY features extend to a much larger class of observables and to higher Landau levels. Finally we identify a set of new super-Ward identities and show how observables in the disordered theory must satisfy them.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated dynamics of annealed glasses near the yielding transition under cyclic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While experiments and simulations have provided a rich picture of the dynamic heterogeneity in glasses at constant temperature or under steady shear, the dynamics of glasses under oscillatory shear remain comparatively less explored. Recent work has shown that oscillatory shear protocols can embed a ``memory'' into a glass's structure, whereby the material will exhibit dynamics that are encoded by the oscillatory shear protocol applied. However, most of the computational work studying the memory effect has been performed in the zero temperature limit, and the effects of thermalization are poorly characterized. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of a model two-dimensional glass former at low, non-zero temperatures under oscillatory shear. While we show that the systems' dynamics are independent of sample preparation for either small or larger strain amplitudes, the dynamics become distinct near the yield point when the deformation is applied at finite temperature. We then characterize the dynamic heterogeneity using two metrics, one derived from the vibrational modes and one that exploits machine learning to identify regions prone to rearrangement. This analysis provides evidence that the dynamics below and above yield emerge from distinct structural origins that may be important for developing improved constitutive models that can predict memory in disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Symmetry Breaking in Circular Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates interaction-induced symmetry breaking in circular quantum dots. We explain that the anisotropic static Wigner molecule ground states frequently observed in simulations are created by interference effects that occur even in the non-interacting limit. They have nothing in common with the interaction-driven crystallization of the uniform electron gas described by Wigner. This leads us to define the term Wigner molecule more carefully, via a finite analog of the spontaneous symmetry breaking that arises in the homogeneous electron gas when the interactions are strong. According to this definition, the charge density patterns characteristic of true interaction-induced Wigner molecules can only be seen if a small symmetry-breaking perturbation is applied to a strongly interacting quantum dot. A simple argument based on separation of variables into center-of-mas and internal coordinates shows that the strength of the perturbation required to produce a finite effect on the density tends to zero in the limit as the strength of the interaction tends to infinity. We confirm computationally that interaction-induced Wigner molecules satisfying these two criteria exist. The neural-network variational Monte Carlo method used in our simulations proves more accurate than the coupled cluster and diffusion Monte Carlo methods employed in previous benchmark calculations of quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Integrable Matrix Probabilistic Diffusions and the Matrix Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a matrix version of the stochastic heat equation, the MSHE, and obtain its explicit invariant measure in spatial dimension $D=1$. We show that it is classically integrable in the weak-noise regime, in terms of the matrix extension of the imaginary-time $1D$ nonlinear Schrodinger equation which allows us to study its short-time large deviations through inverse scattering. The MSHE can be viewed as a continuum limit of the matrix log Gamma polymer on the square lattice introduced recently. We also show classical integrability of that discrete model, as well as of other extensions such as of the semi-discrete matrix O'Connell-Yor polymer and the matrix strict-weak polymer. For all these models, we obtain the Lax pairs of their weak-noise regime, as well as the invariant measure, using a fluctuation--dissipation transformation on the dynamical action.</description>

      <title>On Marginal Stability in Low Temperature Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show marginal stability of near-ground states in spherical spin glasses is equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking at zero temperature near overlap $1$. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, and obtain geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for vector spin glass models. For generic models, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>
