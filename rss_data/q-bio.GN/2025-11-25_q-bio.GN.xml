      <title>The TAG array of a multiple sequence alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern genomic analyses increasingly rely on pangenomes, that is, representations of the genome of entire populations. The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Gene Learning: Spatial Gene Expression Estimation by Auxiliary Gene Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \ Gene \ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Flow Decompositions in General Graphs via Dominators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.
  Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.
  We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging genomic deep learning models for the prediction of non-coding variant effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing non-coding variant function remains an important challenge in human genetics. Genomic deep learning models have emerged as a promising approach to enable in silico prediction of variant effects. These include supervised sequence-to-activity models, which predict molecular phenotypes such as genome-wide chromatin states or gene expression levels directly from DNA sequence, and self-supervised genomic language models. Here, we review progress in leveraging these models for non-coding variant effect prediction. We describe practical considerations for making such predictions and categorize the types of ground truth data used to evaluate variant effect predictions, providing insight into the settings in which current models are most useful. Our Review highlights key considerations for practitioners and opportunities for improvement in model development and evaluation.</description>

      <title>CFM-GP: Unified Conditional Flow Matching to Learn Gene Perturbation Across Cell Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type. Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type, limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous, time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling, CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation, and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways. These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.</description>

      <title>Classification of autoimmune diseases from Peripheral blood TCR repertoires by multimodal multi-instance learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.</description>
