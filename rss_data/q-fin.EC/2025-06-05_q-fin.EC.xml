      <title>Disentangling Barriers to Welfare Program Participation with Semiparametric and Mixed Effect Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines why eligible households do not participate in welfare programs. Under the assumption that there exist some observed fully attentive groups, we model take-up as a two-stage process: attention followed by choice. We do so with two novel approaches. Drawing inspiration from the demand estimation for stochastically attentive consumers literature, Approach I is semiparametric with a nonparametric attention function and a parametric choice function. It uses fully attentive households to identify choice utility parameters and then uses the entire population to identify the attention probabilities. By augmenting Approach I with a random effect that simultaneously affects the attention and choice stages, Approach II allows household-level unobserved heterogeneity and dependence between attention and choice even after conditioning on observed covariates.
  Applied to NLSY panel data for WIC participation, both approaches consistently point to two empirical findings with regard to heterogeneous policy targeting. (1) As an infant ages towards 12 months and beyond, attention probability drops dramatically while choice probability steadily decreases. Finding (1) suggests that exit-prevention is the key for increasing the take-up rate because once a household exits the program when the infant ages close to 12 months old, it is unlikely to rejoin due to low attention. A value-increasing solution is predicted to be effective in promoting take-up by reducing exit probability. In contrast, an attention-raising solution is predicted to be ineffective. (2) Higher educated households are less attentive but more likely to enroll if attentive. Finding (2) suggests that running informational campaigns with parenting student groups at higher education institutions could be an effective strategy for boosting take-up.</description>

      <title>My Advisor, Her AI and Me: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Human-AI Collaboration and Investment Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid ongoing policy and managerial debates on keeping humans in the loop of AI decision-making, we investigate whether human involvement in AI-based service production benefits downstream consumers. Partnering with a large savings bank in Europe, we produced pure AI and human-AI collaborative investment advice, passed it to customers, and examined their advice-taking in a field experiment. On the production side, contrary to concerns that humans might inefficiently override AI output, we find that giving a human banker the final say over AI-generated financial advice does not compromise its quality. More importantly, on the consumption side, customers are more likely to follow investment advice from the human-AI collaboration compared to pure AI, especially when facing riskier decisions. In our setting, this increased reliance leads to higher material welfare for consumers. Additional analyses from the field experiment and an online experiment show that the persuasive power of human-AI advice cannot be explained by consumers' beliefs about enhanced advice quality due to human-AI complementarities. Instead, the benefit stems from human involvement acting as a peripheral cue that increases the advice's affective appeal. Our findings suggest that regulations and guidelines should adopt a consumer-centered approach by fostering service environments in which humans and AI systems can collaborate to improve consumer outcomes. These insights are relevant for managers designing AI-based services and for policymakers advocating for human oversight in AI systems.</description>

      <title>Market power abuse in wholesale electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wholesale electricity markets, prices fluctuate widely from hour to hour and electricity generators price-hedge their output using longer-term contracts, such as monthly base futures. Consequently, the incentives they face to drive up the power prices by reducing supply has a high hourly specificity, and because of hedging, they regularly also face an incentive to depress prices by inflating supply. In this study, we explain the dynamics between hedging and market power abuse in wholesale electricity markets and use this framework to identify market power abuse in real markets. We estimate the hourly economic incentives to deviate from competitive behavior and examine the empirical association between such incentives and observed generation patterns. Exploiting hourly variation also controls for potential estimation bias that do not correlate with economic incentives at the hourly level, such as unobserved cost factors. Using data of individual generation units in Germany in a six-year period 2019-2024, we find that in hours where it is more profitable to inflate prices, companies indeed tend to withhold capacity. We find that the probability of a generation unit being withheld increases by about 1 % per euro increase in the net profit from withholding one megawatt of capacity. The opposite is also true for hours in which companies benefit financially from lower prices, where we find units being more likely to be pushed into the market by 0.3 % per euro increase in the net profit from capacity push-in. We interpret the result as empirical evidence of systematic market power abuse.</description>

      <title>Welfare Reform: Consequences for the Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses register-based data to analyze the consequences of a recent major Danish welfare reform for children's academic performance and well-being. In addition to work requirements, the reform brought about considerable reductions in welfare transfers. We implement a comparative event study that contrasts outcomes for individuals on welfare at the time of reform announcement before and after the implementation of the reform with the parallel development in outcomes for an uncontaminated comparison group, namely those on welfare exactly one year prior. Our analysis documents that mothers' propensity to receive welfare decreased somewhat as a consequence of the reform, just as we observe a small increase in hours worked. At the same time, we do not detect negative effects on short-run child academic performance. We do find small negative effects on children's self-reported school well-being and document substantial upticks in reports to child protective services for children exposed to the reform.</description>

      <title>Risk and Reward of Transitioning from a National to a Zonal Electricity Market in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More spatially granular electricity wholesale markets promise more efficient operation and better asset siting in highly renewable power systems. Great Britain is considering moving from its current single-price national wholesale market to a zonal design. Existing studies reach varying and difficult-to-reconcile conclusions about the desirability of a zonal market in GB, partly because they rely on models that vary in their transparency and assumptions about future power systems. Using a novel open-source electricity market model, calibrated to match observed network behaviour, this article quantifies consumer savings, unit-level producer surplus impacts, and broader socioeconomic benefits that would have arisen had a six-zone market operated in Great Britain during 2022-2024. In the absence of mitigating policies, it is estimated that during those three years GB consumers would save approximately {\pounds}9.4/MWh (equalling an average of more than {\pounds}2.3B per year), but generators in northern regions would experience revenue reductions of 30-40\%. Policy interventions can restore these units' national market revenues to up to 97\% while still preserving around {\pounds}3.1/MWh in consumer savings (about {\pounds}750M per year). It is further estimated that the current system could achieve approximately {\pounds}380-{\pounds}770 million in annual welfare gain during 2022-2024 through improved operational efficiency alone. The drivers behind these benefits, notably wind curtailment volumes, are expected to become more pronounced towards 2030, suggesting that purely operationally achieved annual benefits of around {\pounds}1-2 billion beyond 2029 are likely. It is found that the scale of these benefits would outweigh the potential downsides related to increases in the cost of capital that have been estimated elsewhere.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Irrelevance of Total-Value-Locked on Cryptocurrency Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common assumption in cryptocurrency markets is a positive relationship between total-value-locked (TVL) and cryptocurrency returns. To test this hypothesis we examine whether the returns of TVL-sorted portfolios can be explained by common cryptocurrency factors. We find evidence that portfolios formed on TVL exhibit returns that are linear functions of aggregate crypto market returns, that is they can be replicated with appropriate weights on the crypto market portfolio. Thus, strategies based on TVL can be priced with standard asset pricing tools. This result holds true both for total TVL and a simple TVL measure that removes a number of ways TVL may be overstated.</description>

      <title>Balancing Efficiency and Equity in Classroom Assignment under Endogenous Peer Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02497v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a three-step empirical framework for optimizing classroom assignments under endogenous peer effects, using data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS).
  We design \textit{PeerNN}, a neural network that mimics endogenous network formation as a discrete choice model, generating a friendship-intensity matrix ($\Omega$) that captures student popularity.
  \textbf{Step 2: Estimating Peer Effects.} We measure the peer effect friends' average 6th-grade class rank weighted by $\Omega$ on 8th-grade cognitive test score. Incorporating $\Omega$ into the linear-in-means model induces endogeneity. Using quasi-random classroom assignments, we instrument friends' average 6th-grade class rank with the average classmates' 6th-grade class rank (unweighted by $\Omega$). Our main regression result shows that a 10\% improvement in friends' 6th-grade class rank raises 8th-grade cognitive test scores by 0.13 SD. Positive $\beta$ implies maximizing (minimizing) the popularity of high (low) achievers optimizes outcomes.
  \textbf{Step 3: Simulating Policy Trade-offs.} We use estimates from Step 1 and Step 2 to simulate optimal classroom assignments. We first implement a genetic algorithm (GA) to maximize average peer effect and observe a 1.9\% improvement. However, serious inequity issues arise: low-achieving students are hurt the most in the pursuit of the higher average peer effect. We propose an \textit{Algorithmically Fair GA} (AFGA), achieving a 1.2\% gain while ensuring more equitable educational outcomes.
  These results underscore that efficiency-focused classroom assignment policies can exacerbate inequality. We recommend incorporating fairness considerations when designing classroom assignment policies that account for endogenous spillovers.</description>

      <title>AI and the Dynamic Supply of Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems rely heavily on human-generated data, yet the people behind that data are often overlooked. Human behavior can play a major role in AI training datasets, be it in limiting access to existing works or in deciding which types of new works to create or whether to create any at all. We examine creators' behavioral change when their works become training data for commercial AI. Specifically, we focus on contributors on Unsplash, a popular stock image platform with about 6 million high-quality photos and illustrations. In the summer of 2020, Unsplash launched a research program and released a dataset of 25,000 images for commercial AI use. We study contributors' reactions, comparing contributors whose works were included in this dataset to contributors whose works were not. Our results suggest that treated contributors left the platform at a higher-than-usual rate and substantially slowed down the rate of new uploads. Professional photographers and more heavily affected users had a stronger reaction than amateurs and less affected users. We also show that affected users changed the variety and novelty of contributions to the platform, which can potentially lead to lower-quality AI outputs in the long run. Our findings highlight a critical trade-off: the drive to expand AI capabilities versus the incentives of those producing training data. We conclude with policy proposals, including dynamic compensation schemes and structured data markets, to realign incentives at the data frontier.</description>

      <title>Job Loss and Political Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supply of politicians affects the quality of democratic institutions. Yet little is known about the economic motivations that drive individuals into politics. This paper examines how experiencing a job loss affects individuals' decisions to enter political life and explores its implications for political selection. Using highly granular administrative data linking individual records of political participation with comprehensive employer-employee data for all formal workers in Brazil, and leveraging mass layoffs for causal identification, we find that job loss significantly increases the likelihood of joining a political party and running for local office. Layoff-induced candidates are positively selected on various competence measures, suggesting that economic shocks improve the quality of political entrants. Further, we observe that the increase in candidacies is more pronounced among laid-off individuals with greater financial incentives from holding office and higher predicted income losses. Finally, using a regression discontinuity design, we find that eligibility for unemployment benefits increases the likelihood of becoming a party member and running for local office. These results are consistent with the reduction in private-sector opportunity costs and the increased time resources explaining the rise in political entry.</description>

      <title>The optimum mix of storage and backup in a highly renewable, highly reliable European electricity grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the variability of solar and wind energy generation potential in Europe over a 43 year period between 1980-2022 with the MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets. We compare the estimated supply potential to hourly demand data from 36 European countries to calculate the reliability of a highly renewable electricity grid in Europe. We find that in cost-optimised scenarios with onshore wind, solar and storage, but no natural gas, reliably meeting the last 1% of demand represents 36% of the entire system cost. Including small amounts of dispatchable natural gas drastically reduces the cost of a renewable, highly reliable grid: overall system costs fall by 31% when just 1% of total generation is permitted to come from natural gas. Large renewable overbuild factors (greater than $\times$4 peak demand) are required to meet modern grid reliability standards in all scenarios, and wind, rather than solar, dominates the generation mix.</description>

      <title>Balancing Profit and Fairness in Risk-Based Pricing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit. We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal proposition that bounding each firm's \emph{local} demographic gap implicitly bounds the \emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties. Building on this insight we introduce \texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source, scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms -- and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an $\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S. health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises demand-fairness by up to $16\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.</description>
