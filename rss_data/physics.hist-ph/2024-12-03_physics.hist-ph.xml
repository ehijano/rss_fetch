      <title>Boundaries, frames and gravitational limits to objectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general conceptual aim. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modeling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. The conceptual aim is to gain a better understanding of the influence of observers in physics and the ensuing limits of objectivity.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Emergence and the Fear of Intimacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a reply to the Argument from Intimacy on behalf of defenders of emergent spacetime in theories of quantum gravity. We argue that if one accepts that spacetime regions are nowhere in the sense that they are locations but do not have locations, then the Argument from Intimacy can be resolved. We go on to consider a problem with this response, namely that it is unavailable to super-substantivalists. We argue that this is right for identity but not priority super-substantivalists. We then suggest that there is no cost for our solution here, since identity versions of super-substantivalism face severe challenges in the context of spacetime emergence and so should be rejected anyway.</description>

      <title>In Search of Truth: In memory of Balraj Singh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Born in Punjab (India) in December 1941, Balraj Singh is not only the single most prolific nuclear data evaluator and disseminator of nuclear structure and decay data with 148 evaluations in Nuclear Data Sheets -- 85 as the first and often only author -- plus other journals, but his upmost curiosity and dedication brought him to be one of the finest nuclear physicists, with an everlasting influence on many of us. Balraj passed away about a year ago on 9 October 2023 in Ottawa, Ontario (Canada) at the age of 81, and at Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables we would like to commemorate some of his scientific achievements.</description>
