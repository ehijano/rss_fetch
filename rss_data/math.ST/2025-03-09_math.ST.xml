      <title>Optimal and fast online change point estimation in linear regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sequential estimation of a single change point in a piecewise linear regression model under a Gaussian setup. We demonstrate that a certain CUSUM-type statistic attains the minimax optimal rates for localizing the change point. Our minimax analysis unveils an interesting phase transition from a jump (discontinuity in values) to a kink (change in slope). Specifically, for a jump, the minimax rate is of order $\log (n) / n$, whereas for a kink it scales as $\bigl(\log (n) / n\bigr)^{1/3}$, given that the sampling rate is of order $1/n$. We further introduce an algorithm for the proposed online change point detector, which requires constant computational steps and constant memory per incoming sample. Finally, the empirical performance of our method is examined on both simulated and real-world data sets. An implementation is available in the R package FLOC on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dominance of sums of risks under dependence conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide conditions for the stochastic dominance comparisons of a risk $X$ and an associated risk $X+Z$, where $Z$ represents the uncertainty due to the environment and where $X$ and $Z$ can be dependent. The comparisons depend on both the copula $C$ between the distributions of $X$ and $Z$ and on the distribution of $Z$. We provide two different conditions for $C$ which represents new positive dependence properties. Regarding $Z$, we need some symmetry or asymmetry (skew) properties. Some illustrative examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for Partially Observed Affine and Polynomial Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to parameter estimation for partially observed polynomial state space models. This class includes discretely observed affine or more generally polynomial Markov processes. The polynomial structure allows for the explicit computation of a Gaussian quasi-likelihood estimator and its asymptotic covariance matrix. We show consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimating sequence and provide explicitly computable expressions for the corresponding asymptotic covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Estimation of relative risk, odds ratio and their logarithms with guaranteed accuracy and controlled sample size ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two populations from which independent binary observations are taken with parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$ respectively, estimators are proposed for the relative risk $p_1/p_2$, the odds ratio $p_1(1-p_2)/(p_2(1-p_1))$ and their logarithms. The estimators guarantee that the relative mean-square error, or the mean-square error for the logarithmic versions, is less than a target value for any $p_1, p_2 \in (0,1)$, and the ratio of average sample sizes from the two populations is close to a prescribed value. The estimators can also be used with group sampling, whereby samples are taken in batches of fixed size from the two populations. The efficiency of the estimators with respect to the Cram\'er-Rao bound is good, and in particular it is close to $1$ for small values of the target error.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based estimators for functional causal effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose causal effect estimators based on empirical Fr\'{e}chet means and operator-valued kernels, tailored to functional data spaces. These methods address the challenges of high-dimensionality, sequential ordering, and model complexity while preserving robustness to treatment misspecification. Using structural assumptions, we obtain compact representations of potential outcomes, enabling scalable estimation of causal effects over time and across covariates. We provide both theoretical, regarding the consistency of functional causal effects, as well as empirical comparison of a range of proposed causal effect estimators.
  Applications to binary treatment settings with functional outcomes illustrate the framework's utility in biomedical monitoring, where outcomes exhibit complex temporal dynamics. Our estimators accommodate scenarios with registered covariates and outcomes, aligning them to the Fr\'{e}chet means, as well as cases requiring higher-order representations to capture intricate covariate-outcome interactions. These advancements extend causal inference to dynamic and non-linear domains, offering new tools for understanding complex treatment effects in functional data settings.</description>

      <title>Graph Alignment via Birkhoff Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the graph alignment problem, wherein the objective is to find a vertex correspondence between two graphs that maximizes the edge overlap. The graph alignment problem is an instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known to be NP-hard in the worst case even to approximately solve. In this paper, we analyze Birkhoff relaxation, a tight convex relaxation of QAP, and present theoretical guarantees on its performance when the inputs follow the Gaussian Wigner Model. More specifically, the weighted adjacency matrices are correlated Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with correlation $1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$. Denote the optimal solutions of the QAP and Birkhoff relaxation by $\Pi^\star$ and $X^\star$ respectively. We show that $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = o(n)$ when $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$ and $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = \Omega(n)$ when $\sigma = \Omega(n^{-0.5})$. Thus, the optimal solution $X^\star$ transitions from a small perturbation of $\Pi^\star$ for small $\sigma$ to being well separated from $\Pi^\star$ as $\sigma$ becomes larger than $n^{-0.5}$. This result allows us to guarantee that simple rounding procedures on $X^\star$ align $1-o(1)$ fraction of vertices correctly whenever $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$. This condition on $\sigma$ to ensure the success of the Birkhoff relaxation is state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Comparing regularisation paths of (conjugate) gradient estimators in ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider standard gradient descent, gradient flow and conjugate gradients as iterative algorithms for minimizing a penalized ridge criterion in linear regression. While it is well known that conjugate gradients exhibit fast numerical convergence, the statistical properties of their iterates are more difficult to assess due to inherent nonlinearities and dependencies. On the other hand, standard gradient flow is a linear method with well known regularizing properties when stopped early. By an explicit non-standard error decomposition we are able to bound the prediction error for conjugate gradient iterates by a corresponding prediction error of gradient flow at transformed iteration indices. This way, the risk along the entire regularisation path of conjugate gradient iterations can be compared to that for regularisation paths of standard linear methods like gradient flow and ridge regression. In particular, the oracle conjugate gradient iterate shares the optimality properties of the gradient flow and ridge regression oracles up to a constant factor. Numerical examples show the similarity of the regularisation paths in practice.</description>

      <title>Filtering of partially observed polynomial processes in discrete and continuous time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to filtering, smoothing, and prediction of polynomial processes that are partially observed. These problems are known to allow for an explicit solution in the simpler case of linear Gaussian state space models. The key insight underlying the present piece of research is that in filtering applications polynomial processes and their discrete counterpart are indistinguishable from Gaussian processes sharing their first two moments. We describe the construction of these Gaussian equivalents of polynomial processes and explicitly compute optimal linear filters, predictors and smoothers for polynomial processes in discrete and continuous time. The consideration of Gaussian equivalents also opens the door to parameter estimation and linear-quadratic optimal control in the context of polynomial processes.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of non-parametric statistical inference for integrated quantiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general non-parametric statistical inference theory for integrals of quantiles without assuming any specific sampling design or dependence structure. Technical considerations are accompanied by examples and discussions, including those pertaining to the bias of empirical estimators. To illustrate how the general results can be adapted to specific situations, we derive - at a stroke and under minimal conditions - consistency and asymptotic normality of the empirical tail-value-at-risk, Lorenz and Gini curves at any probability level in the case of the simple random sampling, thus facilitating a comparison of our results with what is already known in the literature. Results, notes and references concerning dependent (i.e., time series) data are also offered. As a by-product, our general results provide new and unified proofs of large-sample properties of a number of classical statistical estimators, such as trimmed means, and give additional insights into the origins of, and the reasons for, various necessary and sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Early Stopping for Regression Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop early stopping rules for growing regression tree estimators. The fully data-driven stopping rule is based on monitoring the global residual norm. The best-first search and the breadth-first search algorithms together with linear interpolation give rise to generalized projection or regularization flows. A general theory of early stopping is established. Oracle inequalities for the early-stopped regression tree are derived without any smoothness assumption on the regression function, assuming the original CART splitting rule, yet with a much broader scope. The remainder terms are of smaller order than the best achievable rates for Lipschitz functions in dimension $d\ge 2$. In real and synthetic data the early stopping regression tree estimators attain the statistical performance of cost-complexity pruning while significantly reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Tensor PCA for Factor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern empirical analysis often relies on high-dimensional panel datasets with non-negligible cross-sectional and time-series correlations. Factor models are natural for capturing such dependencies. A tensor factor model describes the $d$-dimensional panel as a sum of a reduced rank component and an idiosyncratic noise, generalizing traditional factor models for two-dimensional panels. We consider a tensor factor model corresponding to the notion of a reduced multilinear rank of a tensor. We show that for a strong factor model, a simple tensor principal component analysis algorithm is optimal for estimating factors and loadings. When the factors are weak, the convergence rate of simple TPCA can be improved with alternating least-squares iterations. We also provide inferential results for factors and loadings and propose the first test to select the number of factors. The new tools are applied to the problem of imputing missing values in a multidimensional panel of firm characteristics.</description>

      <title>Robust Functional Principal Component Analysis for Non-Euclidean Random Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional data analysis offers a diverse toolkit of statistical methods tailored for analyzing samples of real-valued random functions. Recently, samples of time-varying random objects, such as time-varying networks, have been increasingly encountered in modern data analysis. These data structures represent elements within general metric spaces that lack local or global linear structures, rendering traditional functional data analysis methods inapplicable. Moreover, the existing methodology for time-varying random objects does not work well in the presence of outlying objects. In this paper, we propose a robust method for analysing time-varying random objects. Our method employs pointwise Fr\'{e}chet medians and then constructs pointwise distance trajectories between the individual time courses and the sample Fr\'{e}chet medians. This representation effectively transforms time-varying objects into functional data. A novel robust approach to functional principal component analysis based on a Winsorized U-statistic estimator of the covariance structure is introduced. The proposed robust analysis of these distance trajectories is able to identify key features of time-varying objects and is useful for downstream analysis. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, numerical studies focusing on dynamic networks are conducted. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits good all-round performance and surpasses the existing approach in terms of robustness, showcasing its superior performance in handling time-varying objects data.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation and Bayesian Fusion on Unimodular Lie Groups from a Parametric Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian fusion on unimodular Lie groups. Starting from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) defined on Lie groups via Mckean-Gangolli injection, we first convert it to a parametric SDE in exponential coordinates. The coefficient transform method for the conversion is stated for both Ito's and Stratonovich's interpretation of the SDE. Then we derive a mean and covariance fitting formula for probability distributions on Lie groups defined by a concentrated distribution on the exponential coordinate. It is used to derive the mean and covariance propagation equations for the SDE defined by injection, which coincides with the result derived from a Fokker-Planck equation in previous work. We also propose a simple modification to the update step of Kalman filters using the fitting formula, which improves the fusion accuracy with moderate computation time.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap inference for linear regression between variables that are never jointly observed: application in in vivo experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00140v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern experimental science, there is a common problem of estimating the coefficients of a linear regression in a context where the variables of interest cannot be observed simultaneously. When there is a categorical variable that is observed on all statistical units, we consider two estimators of linear regression that take this additional information into account: an estimator based on moments and an estimator based on optimal transport theory. These estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian under weak hypotheses. The asymptotic variance has no explicit expression, except in some special cases, for which reason a stratified bootstrap approach is developed to construct confidence intervals for the estimated parameters, whose consistency is also shown. A simulation study evaluating and comparing the finite sample performance of these estimators demonstrates the advantages of the bootstrap approach in several realistic scenarios. An application to in vivo experiments, conducted in the context of studying radio-induced adverse effects in mice, revealed important relationships between the biomarkers of interest that could not be identified with the considered naive approach.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference and A/B Testing in Fisher Markets and Paced Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for two market equilibrium models: linear Fisher market (LFM) equilibrium and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE). LFM arises from fair resource allocation systems such as allocation of food to food banks and notification opportunities to different types of notifications. For LFM, we assume that the data observed is captured by the classical finite-dimensional Fisher market equilibrium, and its steady-state behavior is modeled by a continuous limit Fisher market. The second type of equilibrium we study, FPPE, arises from internet advertising where advertisers are constrained by budgets and advertising opportunities are sold via first-price auctions. For platforms that use pacing-based methods to smooth out the spending of advertisers, FPPE provides a hindsight-optimal configuration of the pacing method. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a continuous limit FPPE models the steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and a finite FPPE provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE. Both LFM and FPPE have an Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization, the pillar upon which we derive our statistical theory. We start by deriving basic convergence results for the finite market to the limit market. We then derive asymptotic distributions, and construct confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of estimation based on finite markets. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments verify the validity and practicality of our theory.</description>
