      <title>Sheaf Topos Theory: A powerful setting for Lagrangian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an introductory exposition to the sheaf topos theoretic description of classical field theory motivated by the rigorous description of both $\bf{(i)}$ the variational calculus of (infinite dimensional) field-theoretic spaces, and $\bf(ii)$ the non-triviality of classical fermionic field spaces. These considerations naturally lead to the definition of the sheaf topos of super smooth sets. We close by indicating natural generalizations necessary to include to the description of infinitesimal structure of field spaces and further the non-perturbative description of (higher) gauge fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each of the forty-eight exceptional algebraic solutions $u(x)$ of the sixth equation of Painlev\'e, we build the algebraic curve $P(u,x)=0$ of a degree conjectured to be minimal, then we give an optimal parametric representation of it. This degree is equal to the number of branches, except for fifteen solutions.</description>

      <title>On the SUSY structure of spherically symmetric Pauli Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the quantum Hamiltonian characterising a non-relativistic electron under the influence of an external spherical symmetric electromagnetic potential exhibits a supersymmetric structure. Both cases, spherical symmetric scalar potentials and spherical symmetric vector potentials are discussed in detail. The current approach, which includes the spin-1/2 degree of freedom, provides new insights to known models like the radial harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb problem. We also find a few new exactly solvable models, one of them exhibiting a new mixed type of shape invariance containing translation and scaling of potential parameters. The fundamental role as Witten parity played by the spin-orbit operator is high-lighted.</description>

      <title>From kinetic gasses to an exponentially expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and partial majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider families of tight upper bounds on the difference $S(\rho)-S(\sigma)$ with the rank/energy constraint imposed on the state $\rho$ which are valid provided that the state $\rho$ partially majorizes the state $\sigma$ and is close to the state $\sigma$ w.r.t. the trace norm.
  The upper bounds within these families depend on the parameter $m$ of partial majorization. The upper bounds corresponding to $m=1$ coincide with the optimal semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy with the rank/energy constraint obtained in [Lett.Math.Phys.,113,121,35] and [arXiv:2410.02686].
  We also consider classical versions of the above results formulated in terms of probability distributions and the Shannon entropy.</description>

      <title>An easily computable measure of Gaussian quantum imaginarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resource-theoretic frameworks for quantum imaginarity have been developed in recent years. Within these frameworks, many imaginarity measures for finite-dimensional systems have been proposed. However, for imaginarity of Gaussian states in continuous-variable (CV) systems, there are only two known Gaussian imaginarity measures, which exhibit prohibitive computational complexity when applied to multi-mode Gaussian states. In this paper, we propose a computable Gaussian imaginarity measure $\mathcal I^{G_n}$ for $n$-mode Gaussian systems. The value of $\mathcal I^{G_n}$ is simply formulated by the displacement vectors and covariance matrices of Gaussian states. A comparative analysis of $\mathcal{I}^{G_n}$ with existing two Gaussian imaginarity measures indicates that $\mathcal{I}^{G_n}$ can be used to detect imaginarity in any $n$-mode Gaussian states more efficiently. As an application, we study the dynamics behaviour of $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states in Gaussian Markovian noise environments for two-mode CV system by utilizing ${\mathcal I}^{G_2}$. Moreover, we prove that, ${\mathcal I}^{G_n}$ can induce a quantification of any $m$-multipartite multi-mode CV systems which satisfies all requirements for measures of multipartite multi-mode Gaussian correlations, which unveils that, $n$-mode Gaussian imaginarity can also be regarded as a kind of multipatite multi-mode Gaussian correlation and is a multipartite Gaussian quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks and Betti Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the theory of spectral networks in real contact and symplectic topology. First, we establish the existence and pseudoholomorphic characterization of spectral networks for Lagrangian fillings in the cotangent bundle of a smooth surface. These are proven via analytic results on the adiabatic degeneration of Floer trajectories and the explicit computation of continuation strips. Second, we construct a Family Floer functor for Lagrangian fillings endowed with a spectral network and prove its equivalence to the non-abelianization functor. In particular, this implies that both the framed 2d-4d BPS states and the Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke non-abelianized parallel transport are realized as part of the $A_\infty$-operations of the associated 4d partially wrapped Fukaya categories. To conclude, we present a new construction relating spectral networks and Lagrangian fillings using Demazure weaves, and show the precise relation between spectral networks and augmentations of the Legendrian contact dg-algebra.</description>

      <title>Localization for Random Schr\"odinger Operators Defined by Block Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with random potentials obtained via a block code applied to an i.i.d. sequence of random variables. It is shown that, almost surely, these operators exhibit spectral and dynamical localization, the latter away from a finite set of exceptional energies. We make no assumptions beyond non-triviality, neither on the regularity of the underlying random variables, nor on the linearity, the monotonicity, or even the continuity of the block code. Central to our proof is a reduction to the non-stationary Anderson model via Fubini.</description>

      <title>Rational Extension of Quantum Anisotropic Oscillator Potentials with Linear and/or Quadratic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the rational extension of the quantum anisotropic harmonic oscillator (QAHO) potentials with linear and/or quadratic perturbations. For the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator plus imaginary linear perturbation ($i\lambda x$), we show that the rational extension is possible not only for the even but also for the odd co-dimensions $m$. In two-dimensional case, we construct the rational extensions for QAHO potentials with quadratic ($\lambda \, xy$) perturbation both when $\lambda$ is real or imaginary and obtain their solutions. Finally, we extend the discussion to the three-dimensional QAHO with linear and quadratic perturbations and obtain the corresponding rationally extended potentials. For all these cases, we obtain the conditions under which the spectrum remains real and also when there is degeneracy in the system.</description>

      <title>Sums of infinite series involving the Dirichlet lambda function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $$ \lambda(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^{s}},~\textrm{Re}(s)&gt;1 $$ be Dirichlet's lambda function, which was firstly studied by Euler in the real axis under the notation $N(s)$. In this paper, by applying the partial fractional decomposition of the function $\pi\tan(\pi x)$, the explicit calculation of the integral $\int_0^{\frac12}x^{2m-1}\cos(2k\pi x) dx$ and the zeta-values representation of the integral $\int_0^{\frac12}x^{m-1}\log\cos(\pi x)dx$, we establish closed-form expressions for several classes of infinite series involving $\lambda(s)$. As a by product, we show that the lambda-values $\lambda(2k)$ appears as the constant terms of the Eisenstein series for the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_{0}(2).$</description>

By semigroup estimates, we get the existence and uniqueness of solutions on $$ L^\infty\left((0,T);H^1_\alpha\left(\mathbb R^2\right)\right)\cap L^r\left((0,T);H^{s+1}_\alpha\left(\mathbb R^2\right)\right), $$ with $r&gt;2$, $s&lt;\frac{2}{r}$ for the Cauchy problem with small $T&gt;0$ or small initial conditions on $H^1_\alpha(\mathbb R^2)$. Finally, we prove decay in time of the functions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the ergodic behavior of a system of particules, subject to collisions, before it exits a fixed subdomain of its state space. This system is composed of several one-dimensional ordered Brownian particules in interaction with electrostatic repulsions, which is usually referred as the (generalized) Dyson Brownian motion. The starting points of our analysis are the work [E. C{\'e}pa and D. L{\'e}pingle, 1997 Probab. Theory Relat. Fields] which provides existence and uniqueness of such a system subject to collisions via the theory of multivalued SDEs and a Krein-Rutman type theorem derived in [A. Guillin, B. Nectoux, L. Wu, 2020 J. Eur. Math. Soc.].</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\b_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight \[ \omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \Real, \] with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Delta functions on twistor space and their sign factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When performing the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory from momentum space to real twistor space, we encounter sign factors that break global conformal invariance. Previous studies conjectured that the sign factors are intrinsic in the real twistor space corresponding to the split signature space-time; hence, they will not appear in the complex twistor space corresponding to the Lorentzian signature space-time. In this study, we present a new geometrical interpretation of the sign factors by investigating the domain of the delta functions on the real twistor space. In addition, we propose a new definition of delta functions on the complex twistor space in terms of the Cech cohomology group without any sign factors and show that these delta functions have conformal invariance. Moreover, we show that the inverse Fourier transforms of these delta functions are the scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory. Thus, the sign factors do not appear in the complex twistor space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approach initiated by Holley--Stroock establishes the uniqueness of invariant measures of Glauber dynamics of lattice spin systems from a uniform log-Sobolev inequality. We use this approach to prove uniqueness of the invariant measure of the $\varphi^4_2$ SPDE up to the critical temperature (characterised by finite susceptibility). The approach requires three ingredients: a uniform log-Sobolev inequality (which is already known), a propagation speed estimate, and a crude estimate on the relative entropy of the law of the finite volume dynamics at time $1$ with respect to the finite volume invariant measure. The last two ingredients are understood very generally on the lattice, but the proofs do not extend to SPDEs, and are here established in the instance of the $\varphi^4_2$ dynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolved Entanglement with $U(1)$ Symmetry: Some Closed Formulae for Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit a problem we addressed in previous publications with various collaborators, that is, the computation of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropies of zero-density excited states in infinite volume. The universal nature of the charged moments of these states has already been noted previously. Here, we investigate this problem further, by writing general formulae for the entropies of excited states consisting of an arbitrary number of subsets of identical excitations. When the initial state is written in terms of qubits with appropriate probabilistic coefficients, we find the final formulae to be of a combinatorial nature too. We analyse some of their features numerically and analytically and find that for qubit states consisting of particles of the same charge, the symmetry resolved entropies are independent of region size relative to system size, even if the number and configuration entropies are not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic mechanics is based on the hypothesis that all matter is subject to universal modified Brownian motion. In this report, we calculated probability density distributions using concepts of stochastic mechanics independent of bootstrapping with a known wave function. We calculate a velocity field directly from the potential and total energy and then use the resultant velocity field to do a stochastic Langevin integration over histories to create the probability density distribution for particle position. Using the harmonic oscillator as a minimally sufficient system for our exposition, we explored the effects of spatial and time discretization on solution noise. We explore the effect of energy defect off of the ground state energy on the velocity field, which dictates how a particle interacts with the background of stochastic fluctuations in position, and describes how repulsive drift (negative defect) and constructive oscillation (positive defect) end a stable state as its basin of stability in the velocity field shrinks with increasing energy defect. The results suggest a pathway for future development of stochastic mechanics as a numerical strategy to describe the structure of physical quantum systems for applications in chemistry, materials and information sciences.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we compute the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons on the Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold. The Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold -- the negative spinor bundle of $S^4$ -- is an asymptotically conical manifold where the link is the squashed $7$-sphere. We use the deformation theory developed by the author in a previous paper to calculate the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons and calculate the virtual dimensions of the moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$, random partitions, and topological expansion of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Gaussian measure with parameter $q\in(0,1)$ on the dual of the unitary group of size $N$: we prove that a random highest weight under this measure is the coupling of two independent $q$-uniform random partitions $\alpha,\beta$ and a random highest weight of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. We prove deviation inequalities for the $q$-uniform measure, and use them to show that the coupling of random partitions under the Gaussian measure vanishes in the limit $N\to\infty$. We also prove that the partition function of this measure admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N$, and that this expansion is topological, in the sense that its coefficients are related to the enumeration of ramified coverings of elliptic curves. It provides a rigorous proof of the gauge/string duality for the Yang-Mills theory on a 2D torus with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N),$ advocated by Gross and Taylor \cite{GT,GT2}.</description>

      <title>A systematic path to non-Markovian dynamics II: Probabilistic response of nonlinear multidimensional systems to Gaussian colored noise excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.</description>

Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by the exterior algebra of the tautological bundle. This formula provides a one-parametric deformation of the generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. In particular, we show that the capped vertex functions are rational functions of the quantum parameter.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a simple and novel class of stretch-limiting constitutive relations for perfectly flexible elastic strings drawing from modern advances in constitutive theory for elastic bodies. We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our analysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal, piecewise constant stretched motions.</description>

Abstract: Explicit formulas to calculate MV functions in a basis-free representation are presented for an arbitrary Clifford geometric algebra Cl(p,q). The formulas are based on analysis of the roots of minimal MV polynomial and covers defective MVs, i.e. the MVs that have non-diagonalizable matrix representations. The method may be generalized straightforwardly to matrix functions and to finite dimensional linear operators. The results can find wide application in Clifford algebra analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adjoint-based optimization procedure to control the onset of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with a melting front. A novel cut cell method is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation and the convection-diffusion equation in the fluid layer, as well as the heat equation in the solid phase. To track the interface we use the level set method where its evolution is simply governed by an advection equation. An incomplete continuous adjoint problem is then derived by considering that the velocity field is a check-pointing variable. The results of the minimization problem with a tracking-type cost-functional show that our adjoint method is well suited to optimize the shapes of the fronts in this configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study smooth linear spectral statistics of twisted Laplacians on random $n$-covers of a fixed compact hyperbolic surface $X$. We consider two aspects of such statistics. The first is the fluctuations of such statistics in a small energy window around a fixed energy level when averaged over the space of all degree $n$ covers of $X$. The second is the energy variance of a typical surface.
  In the first case, we show a central limit theorem. Specifically, we show that the distribution of such fluctuations tends to a Gaussian with variance given by the corresponding quantity for the Gaussian Orthogonal/Unitary Ensemble (GOE/GUE). In the second case, we show that the energy variance of a typical random $n$-cover is that of the GOE/GUE. In both cases, we consider a double limit where first we let $n$, the covering degree, go to $\infty$ then let $L\to \infty$ where $1/L$ is the window length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher Forms Symmetries (HFS) of a closed bosonic M2-brane theory formulated on a compactified target space $\mathcal{M}_9 \times T^2$ are obtained. We show that the cancellation of the 't Hooft anomaly present in the theory is related to a 3-form flux with $\mathcal{G}_1^{\nabla}$-gerbe structure associated to the world-volume flux quantization condition. A Wilson surface is naturally introduced on the topological operator that characterize the holonomy of the M2-brane. The projection of the flux quantization condition inherited from the gerbe structure onto the spatial part of the worldvolume, leads to a flux quantization on the M2-brane. The topological operators realise discrete symmetries associated with the winding and the flux/monopole condition. The algebra of operators is well defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the non-demolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the non-demolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain unitary-invariants, known as Bargmann invariants or multivariate traces of quantum states, have recently gained attention due to their applications in quantum information theory. However, determining the boundaries of sets of Bargmann invariants remains a theoretical challenge. In this study, we address the problem by developing a unified, dimension-independent formulation that characterizes the sets of the 3rd and 4th Bargmann invariants.In particular, our result for the set of 4th Bargmann invariants confirms the conjecture given by Fernandes \emph{et al.} [Phys.Rev.Lett.\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.190201}{\textbf{133}, 190201 (2024)}]. Based on the obtained results, we conjecture that the unified, dimension-independent formulation of the boundaries for sets of 3rd-order and 4th-order Bargmann invariants may extend to the general case of the $n$th-order Bargmann invariants. These results deepen our understanding of the fundamental physical limits within quantum mechanics and pave the way for novel applications of Bargmann invariants in quantum information processing and related fields.</description>

Abstract: We provide an analytical formula for the volume ratio between bipartite X-states with positive partial transpose and all bipartite X-states. The result applies to arbitrary $m \times n$-bipartite systems and the volume expressions are derived with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for graviton, "partially massless" graviton, and photon fields in de Sitter spacetime under conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime, that unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton, and photon fields. This framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense and employs Dirac's six-cone formalism. Originally introduced by Dirac, the concept of conformal space and the six-cone formalism were used to derive the field equations for spinor and vector fields in $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form. Our framework extends this approach to dS spacetime, unifying the treatment of massless and ``partially massless'' fields with integer spin $s&gt;0$ under conformal symmetry. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The study of the energy spectrum of a system of quantum micro-vortices in a bounded spatial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum, which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the context of the developed approach.</description>

      <title>Entanglement recycling in port-based teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study entangled resource state recycling after one round of probabilistic port-based teleportation. We analytically characterize its degradation and, for the case of the resource state consisting of $N$ EPR pairs, we demonstrate the possibility of reusing it for a subsequent round of teleportation in the $N \to \infty$ limit. For the case of an optimized resource state, we compare the protocol's performance to multi-port-based teleportation, indicating that the resource state reuse is possible. An analogous comparison is made in the case of the deterministic scheme.</description>
