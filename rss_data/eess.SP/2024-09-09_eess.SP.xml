      <title>Blind-Adaptive Quantizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling and quantization are crucial in digital signal processing, but quantization introduces errors, particularly due to distribution mismatch between input signals and quantizers. Existing methods to reduce this error require precise knowledge of the input's distribution, which is often unavailable. To address this, we propose a blind and adaptive method that minimizes distribution mismatch without prior knowledge of the input distribution. Our approach uses a nonlinear transformation with amplification and modulo-folding, followed by a uniform quantizer. Theoretical analysis shows that sufficient amplification makes the output distribution of modulo-folding nearly uniform, reducing mismatch across various distributions, including Gaussian, exponential, and uniform. To recover the true quantized samples, we suggest using existing unfolding techniques, which, despite requiring significant oversampling, effectively reduce mismatch and quantization error, offering a favorable trade-off similar to predictive coding strategies.</description>

      <title>Subsampling of Correlated Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signals are functions of the underlying graph. When the edge-weight between a pair of nodes is high, the corresponding signals generally have a higher correlation. As a result, the signals can be represented in terms of a graph-based generative model. The question then arises whether measurements can be obtained on a few nodes and whether the correlation structure between the signals can be used to reconstruct the graph signal on the remaining nodes. We show that node subsampling is always possible for graph signals obtained through a generative model. Further, a method to determine the number of nodes to select is proposed based on the tolerable error. A correlation-based fast greedy algorithm is developed for selecting the nodes. Finally, we verify the proposed method on different deterministic and random graphs, and show that near-perfect reconstruction is possible with node subsampling.</description>

      <title>A New Channel Model for OAM Wireless Communication at 5.8 and 28 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) in electromagnetic (EM) waves can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency in wireless communications without requiring additional power, time, or frequency resources. Different OAM modes in EM waves create orthogonal channels, thereby improving spectrum efficiency. Additionally, OAM waves can more easily maintain orthogonality in line-of-sight (LOS) transmissions, offering an advantage over multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technology in LOS scenarios. However, challenges such as divergence and crosstalk hinder OAM's efficiency. Additionally, channel modeling for OAM transmissions is still limited. A reliable channel model with balanced accuracy and complexity is essential for further system analysis. In this paper, we present a quasi-deterministic channel model for OAM channels in the 5.8 GHz and 28 GHz bands based on measurement data. Accurate measurement, especially at high frequencies like millimeter bands, requires synchronized RF channels to maintain phase coherence and purity, which is a major challenge for OAM channel measurement. To address this, we developed an 8-channel OAM generation device at 28 GHz to ensure beam integrity. By measuring and modeling OAM channels at 5.8 GHz and 28 GHz with a modified 3D geometric-based stochastic model (GBSM), this study provides insights into OAM channel characteristics, aiding simulation-based analysis and system optimization.</description>

      <title>Active-IRS-Enabled Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled non-line-of-sight (NLoS) target detection system, in which an active IRS equipped with active reflecting elements and sensors is strategically deployed to facilitate target detection in the NLoS region of the base station (BS) by processing echo signals through the BS-IRS-target-IRS link. First, we design an optimal detector based on the Neyman-Pearson (NP) theorem and derive the corresponding detection probability. Intriguingly, it is demonstrated that the optimal detector can exploit both the BS's transmit signal and the active IRS's reflection noise for more effective detection. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the active IRS to maximize the detection probability, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint at the BS, as well as the maximum amplification power and gain constraints at the active IRS. Finally, simulation results unveil that the proposed joint beamforming design significantly enhances the detection probability, with the active IRS outperforming its fully- and semi-passive counterparts in detection performance.</description>

      <title>Generalized Graph Signal Reconstruction via the Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel uncertainty principle for generalized graph signals that extends classical time-frequency and graph uncertainty principles into a unified framework. By defining joint vertex-time and spectral-frequency spreads, we quantify signal localization across these domains, revealing a trade-off between them. This framework allows us to identify a class of signals with maximal energy concentration in both domains, forming the fundamental atoms for a new joint vertex-time dictionary. This dictionary enhances signal reconstruction under practical constraints, such as incomplete or intermittent data, commonly encountered in sensor and social networks. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing improved reconstruction accuracy and noise robustness compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Whole Heart Perfusion with High-Multiband Simultaneous Multislice Imaging via Linear Phase Modulated Extended Field of View (SMILE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a simultaneous multislice (SMS) first-pass perfusion technique that can achieve whole heart coverage with high multi-band factors, while avoiding the issue of slice leakage. Methods: The proposed Simultaneous Multislice Imaging via Linear phase modulated Extended field of view (SMILE) treats the SMS acquisition and reconstruction within an extended field of view framework, allowing arbitrarily under-sampling of phase encoding lines of the extended k-space matrix and enabling the direct application of 2D parallel imaging reconstruction techniques. We presented a theoretical framework that offers insights into the performance of SMILE. We performed retrospective comparison on 28 subjects and prospective perfusion experiments on 49 patients undergoing routine clinical CMR studies with SMILE at multiband (MB) factors of 3-5, with a total acceleration factor ($R$) of 8 and 10 respectively, and compared SMILE to conventional SMS techniques using standard FOV 2D CAIPI acquisition and standard 2D slice separation techniques including split-slice GRAPPA and ROCK-SPIRiT. Results: Retrospective studies demonstrated 5.2 to 8.0 dB improvement in signal to error ratio (SER) of SMILE over CAIPI perfusion. Prospective studies showed good image quality with grades of 4.5 $\pm$ 0.5 for MB=3, $R$=8 and 3.6 $\pm$ 0.8 for MB=5, $R$=10. (5-point Likert Scale) Conclusion: The theoretical derivation and experimental results validate the SMILE's improved performance at high acceleration and MB factors as compared to the existing 2D CAIPI SMS acquisition and reconstruction techniques for first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging.</description>

      <title>FFT reconstruction of signals from MIMO sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for signal reconstruction using data acquired through multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) sampling. First, we show that it is possible to perfectly reconstruct a set of periodic band-limited signals $\{x_r(t)\}_{r=1}^R$ from the samples of $\{y_m(t)\}_{m=1}^M$, which are the output signals of a MIMO system with inputs $\{x_r(t)\}_{r=1}^R$. Moreover, an FFT-based algorithm is designed to perform the reconstruction efficiently. It is demonstrated that this algorithm encompasses FFT interpolation and multi-channel interpolation as special cases. Then, we investigate the consistency property and the aliasing error of the proposed sampling and reconstruction framework to evaluate its effectiveness in reconstructing non-band-limited signals. The analytical expression for the averaged mean square error (MSE) caused by aliasing is presented. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations, and the performance of the proposed reconstruction method in the presence of noise is also examined.</description>

      <title>The Interference Broadcast Channel with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: A Cooperative Sum-Rate Maximization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the interference broadcast channel comprising multiple multi-antenna Base Stations (BSs), each controlling a beyond diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) and serving multiple single-antenna users. Wideband transmissions are considered with the objective to jointly design the BS linear precoding vectors and the phase configurations at the RISs in a distributed manner. We take into account the frequency selectivity behavior of each RIS's tunable meta-element, and focusing on the sum rate as the system's performance criterion, we present a distributed optimization approach that enables cooperation between the RIS control units and their respective BSs. According to the proposed scheme, each design variable can be efficiently obtained in an iterative parallel way with guaranteed convergence properties. Our simulation results demonstrate the validity of the presented distributed algorithm and showcase its superiority over a non-cooperative scheme as well as over the special case where the RISs have a conventional diagonal structure.</description>

      <title>Ground-roll Separation From Land Seismic Records Based on Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-roll wave is a common coherent noise in land field seismic data. This Rayleigh-type surface wave usually has low frequency, low apparent velocity, and high amplitude, therefore obscures the reflection events of seismic shot gathers. Commonly used techniques focus on the differences of ground-roll and reflection in transformed domain such as $f-k$ domain, wavelet domain, or curvelet domain. These approaches use a series of fixed atoms or bases to transform the data in time-space domain into transformed domain to separate different waveforms, thus tend to suffer from the complexity for a delicate design of the parameters of the transform domain filter. To deal with these problems, a novel way is proposed to separate ground-roll from reflections using convolutional neural network (CNN) model based method to learn to extract the features of ground-roll and reflections automatically based on training data. In the proposed method, low-pass filtered seismic data which is contaminated by ground-roll wave is used as input of CNN, and then outputs both ground-roll component and low-frequency part of reflection component simultaneously. Discriminative loss is applied together with similarity loss in the training process to enhance the similarity to their train labels as well as the difference between the two outputs. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real data, showing that CNN based method can separate ground roll from reflections effectively, and has generalization ability to a certain extent.</description>

      <title>On-board Satellite Image Classification for Earth Observation: A Comparative Study of Pre-Trained Vision Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing image classification is a critical component of Earth observation (EO) systems, traditionally dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning techniques. However, the advent of Transformer-based architectures and large-scale pre-trained models has significantly shifted, offering enhanced performance and efficiency. This study focuses on identifying the most effective pre-trained model for land use classification in onboard satellite processing, emphasizing achieving high accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against noisy data conditions commonly encountered during satellite-based inference. Through extensive experimentation, we compared traditional CNN-based models, ResNet-based models, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Transformer models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite Earth observation tasks. In conclusion, EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient remote sensing image classification in satellite operations, achieving 98.76\% accuracy, precision, and recall. Specifically, EfficientViT-M2 delivered the highest performance across all metrics, excelled in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrated greater robustness (overall robustness score at 0.79).</description>

      <title>Generating High Dimensional User-Specific Wireless Channels using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based algorithms are emerging as an important tool for many physical and MAC layer functions in future wireless communication systems, including for large multi-antenna channels. However, training such models typically requires a large dataset of high-dimensional channel measurements, which are very difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper introduces a novel method for generating synthetic wireless channel data using diffusion-based models to produce user-specific channels that accurately reflect real-world wireless environments. Our approach employs a conditional denoising diffusion implicit models (cDDIM) framework, effectively capturing the relationship between user location and multi-antenna channel characteristics. We generate synthetic high fidelity channel samples using user positions as conditional inputs, creating larger augmented datasets to overcome measurement scarcity. The utility of this method is demonstrated through its efficacy in training various downstream tasks such as channel compression and beam alignment. Our approach significantly improves over prior methods, such as adding noise or using generative adversarial networks (GANs), especially in scenarios with limited initial measurements.</description>

      <title>Low-Earth Orbit Satellite Network Analysis: Coverage under Distance-Dependent Shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a thorough analysis of the coverage performance of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks using a strongest satellite association approach, with a particular emphasis on shadowing effects modeled through a Poisson point process (PPP)-based network framework. We derive an analytical expression for the coverage probability, which incorporates key system parameters and a distance-dependent shadowing probability function, explicitly accounting for both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation channels. To enhance the practical relevance of our findings, we provide both lower and upper bounds for the coverage probability and introduce a closed-form solution based on a simplified shadowing model. Our analysis reveals several important network design insights, including the enhancement of coverage probability by distance-dependent shadowing effects and the identification of an optimal satellite altitude that balances beam gain benefits with interference drawbacks. Notably, our PPP-based network model shows strong alignment with other established models, confirming its accuracy and applicability across a variety of satellite network configurations. The insights gained from our analysis are valuable for optimizing LEO satellite deployment strategies and improving network performance in diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>MixNet: Joining Force of Classical and Modern Approaches Toward the Comprehensive Pipeline in Motor Imagery EEG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have significantly impacted motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, enhancing the decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, most studies struggle to identify discriminative patterns across subjects during MI tasks, limiting MI classification performance. In this article, we propose MixNet, a novel classification framework designed to overcome this limitation by utilizing spectral-spatial signals from MI data, along with a multitask learning architecture named MIN2Net, for classification. Here, the spectral-spatial signals are generated using the filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSPs) method on MI data. Since the multitask learning architecture is used for the classification task, the learning in each task may exhibit different generalization rates and potential overfitting across tasks. To address this issue, we implement adaptive gradient blending, simultaneously regulating multiple loss weights and adjusting the learning pace for each task based on its generalization/overfitting tendencies. Experimental results on six benchmark data sets of different data sizes demonstrate that MixNet consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms in subject-dependent and -independent settings. Finally, the low-density EEG MI classification results show that MixNet outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms, offering promising implications for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages.</description>

      <title>Firefly Algorithm for Movable Antenna Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter addresses a multivariate optimization problem for linear movable antenna arrays (MAAs). Particularly, the position and beamforming vectors of the under-investigated MAA are optimized simultaneously to maximize the minimum beamforming gain across several intended directions, while ensuring interference levels at various unintended directions remain below specified thresholds. To this end, a swarm-intelligence-based firefly algorithm (FA) is introduced to acquire an effective solution to the optimization problem. Simulation results reveal the superior performance of the proposed FA approach compared to the state-of-the-art approach employing alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. This is attributed to the FA's effectiveness in handling non-convex multivariate and multimodal optimization problems without resorting approximations.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Covert Intrusions: Detection of Fault-Masking Cyberattacks on Differential Protection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04242</link>

Abstract: Line Current Differential Relays (LCDRs) are high-speed relays progressively used to protect critical transmission lines. However, LCDRs are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Fault-Masking Attacks (FMAs) are stealthy cyberattacks performed by manipulating the remote measurements of the targeted LCDR to disguise faults on the protected line. Hence, they remain undetected by this LCDR. In this paper, we propose a two-module framework to detect FMAs. The first module is a Mismatch Index (MI) developed from the protected transmission line's equivalent physical model. The MI is triggered only if there is a significant mismatch in the LCDR's local and remote measurements while the LCDR itself is untriggered, which indicates an FMA. After the MI is triggered, the second module, a neural network-based classifier, promptly confirms that the triggering event is a physical fault that lies on the line protected by the LCDR before declaring the occurrence of an FMA. The proposed framework is tested using the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed framework can accurately detect FMAs on LCDRs and is not affected by normal system disturbances, variations, or measurement noise. Our experimental results using OPAL-RT's real-time simulator confirm the proposed solution's real-time performance capability.</description>

      <title>Fast Adaptation for Deep Learning-based Wireless Communications</title>

Abstract: The integration with artificial intelligence (AI) is recognized as one of the six usage scenarios in next-generation wireless communications. However, several critical challenges hinder the widespread application of deep learning (DL) techniques in wireless communications. In particular, existing DL-based wireless communications struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing wireless environments. In this paper, we discuss fast adaptation for DL-based wireless communications by using few-shot learning (FSL) techniques. We first identify the differences between fast adaptation in wireless communications and traditional AI tasks by highlighting two distinct FSL design requirements for wireless communications. To establish a wide perspective, we present a comprehensive review of the existing FSL techniques in wireless communications that satisfy these two design requirements. In particular, we emphasize the importance of applying domain knowledge in achieving fast adaptation. We specifically focus on multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) precoding as an examples to demonstrate the advantages of the FSL to achieve fast adaptation in wireless communications. Finally, we highlight several open research issues for achieving broadscope future deployment of fast adaptive DL in wireless communication applications.</description>

      <title>A MEMS-based terahertz broadband beam steering technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-level tunable reflection array wide-angle beam scanning method is proposed to address the limited bandwidth and small scanning angle issues of current terahertz beam scanning technology. In this method, a focusing lens and its array are used to achieve terahertz wave spatial beam control, and MEMS mirrors and their arrays are used to achieve wide-angle beam scanning. The 1~3 order terahertz MEMS beam scanning system designed based on this method can extend the mechanical scanning angle of MEMS mirrors by 2~6 times, when tested and verified using an electromagnetic MEMS mirror with a 7mm optical aperture and a scanning angle of 15{\deg} and a D-band terahertz signal source. The experiment shows that the operating bandwidth of the first-order terahertz MEMS beam scanning system is better than 40GHz, the continuous beam scanning angle is about 30{\deg}, the continuous beam scanning cycle response time is about 1.1ms, and the antenna gain is better than 15dBi at 160GHz. This method has been validated for its large bandwidth and scalable scanning angle, and has potential application prospects in terahertz dynamic communication, detection radar, scanning imaging, and other fields.</description>

      <title>A Shared Cluster-based Stochastic Channel Model for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a promising technology in the 6G communication. A realistic channel model is a prerequisite for designing ISAC systems. Most existing channel models independently generate the communication and sensing channels under the same framework. However, due to the multiplexing of hardware resources and the same environment, signals enabled for communication and sensing may experience shared propagation scatterers. This practical sharing feature necessities the joint generation of communication and sensing channels for realistic modeling, where the shared clusters (contributed by the shared scatterers) should be reconstructed.In this paper, we first conduct communication and sensing channel measurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. The power-angular-delay profiles of multipath components are obtained, and the shared scatterers by communication and sensing channels are intuitively observed. Then, a stochastic ISAC channel model is proposed to capture the sharing feature, where shared and non-shared clusters by the two channels are dfined and superimposed. To extract those clusters from measured ISAC channels, a KPowerMeans-based joint clustering algorithm is novelly introduced. Finally, stochastic channel characteristics are analyzed, and empirical simulations validate that the channel Sharing Degree (SD) increases with more shared clusters. The proposed model can realistically capture the sharing feature of ISAC channels and is able to evaluate and simulate the channel SD values, which is valuable for the design and deployment of ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmission and Compression Optimization for Networked Sensing with Limited-Capacity Fronthaul Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers networked sensing in cellular network, where multiple base stations (BSs) first compress their received echo signals from multiple targets and then forward the quantized signals to the central unit (CU) via limited-capacity fronthaul links, such that the CU can leverage all useful echo signals to perform high-resolution localization. Under this setup, we manage to characterize the posterior Cramer-Rao Bound (PCRB) for localizing all the targets with random positions as a function of the transmit covariance matrix and the compression noise covariance matrix of each BS. Then, a PCRB minimization problem subject to the transmit power constraints and the fronthaul capacity constraints is formulated to jointly design the BSs' transmission and compression strategies. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem based on the alternating optimization technique. Specifically, it is shown that when either the transmit covariance matrices or the compression noise covariance matrices are fixed, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique can be leveraged to optimize the other type of covariance matrices locally optimally. Moreover, we also propose a novel estimate-then-beamform-then-compress strategy for the massive receive antenna scenario, under which each BS first estimates targets' angle-of-arrivals (AOAs) locally, then beamforms its high-dimension received signals into low-dimension ones based on the estimated AOAs, and last compresses the beamformed signals for fronthaul transmission. An efficient beamforming and compression design method is devised under this strategy. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pick the Largest Margin for Robust Detection of Splicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advancements in splicing detection, practitioners still struggle to fully leverage forensic tools from the literature due to a critical issue: deep learning-based detectors are extremely sensitive to their trained instances. Simple post-processing applied to evaluation images can easily decrease their performances, leading to a lack of confidence in splicing detectors for operational contexts. In this study, we show that a deep splicing detector behaves differently against unknown post-processes for different learned weights, even if it achieves similar performances on a test set from the same distribution as its training one. We connect this observation to the fact that different learnings create different latent spaces separating training samples differently. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between the distributions of latent margins and the ability of the detector to generalize to post-processed images. We thus provide to the practitioner a way to build deep detectors that are more robust than others against post-processing operations, suggesting to train their architecture under different conditions and picking the one maximizing the latent space margin.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Communications: A Tutorial Review</title>

Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays, tremendously high frequencies, and new types of antennas are three clear trends in multi-antenna technology for supporting the sixth-generation (6G) networks. To properly account for the new characteristics introduced by these three trends in communication system design, the near-field spherical-wave propagation model needs to be used, which differs from the classical far-field planar-wave one. As such, near-field communication (NFC) will become essential in 6G networks. In this tutorial, we cover three key aspects of NFC. 1) Channel Modelling: We commence by reviewing near-field spherical-wave-based channel models for spatially-discrete (SPD) antennas. Then, uniform spherical wave (USW) and non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) models are discussed. Subsequently, we introduce a general near-field channel model for SPD antennas and a Green's function-based channel model for continuous-aperture (CAP) antennas. 2) Beamfocusing and Antenna Architectures: We highlight the properties of near-field beamfocusing and discuss NFC antenna architectures for both SPD and CAP antennas. Moreover, the basic principles of near-field beam training are introduced. 3) Performance Analysis: Finally, we provide a comprehensive performance analysis framework for NFC. For near-field line-of-sight channels, the received signal-to-noise ratio and power-scaling law are derived. For statistical near-field multipath channels, a general analytical framework is proposed, based on which analytical expressions for the outage probability, ergodic channel capacity, and ergodic mutual information are obtained. Finally, for each aspect, topics for future research are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Exploiting Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hybrid beamforming design for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) with hybrid analog-digital transmit antenna arrays sends dual-functional signals to communicate with a multi-antenna user and simultaneously sense the location information of a point target based on the reflected echo signals. Specifically, we aim to sense the target's unknown and random angle information by exploiting its prior distribution information, with posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) employed as the sensing performance metric. First, we consider a sensing-only case and study the hybrid beamforming optimization to minimize the sensing PCRB. We analytically prove that hybrid beamforming can achieve the same performance as the optimized digital beamforming as long as the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is larger than 1. Then, we propose a convex relaxation based algorithm for the hybrid beamforming design with a single RF chain. Next, we study the hybrid beamforming optimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate target. Due to the intractability of the exact PCRB expression, we replace it with a tight upper bound. Although this problem is still non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation (FPP-SCA) method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming design.</description>
