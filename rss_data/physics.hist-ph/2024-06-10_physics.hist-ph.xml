      <title>The two-spin enigma: from the helium atom to quantum ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to provide an informal introduction to quantum physics, like if we were following the path of a police investigation. The scenery involves the demise, or vanishing, of some valuable properties of the two electrons in the helium atom. We will start from experimentally based evidence in order to analyse and tentatively explain physical facts, moving cautiously from a classical to a quantum description. Statements such as 'a quantum superposition is like being in two states at the same time', 'quantum entanglement is like an instantaneous action at a distance', or 'facts are relative', will be prohibited as empty of explanatory content. As a spoiler, and maybe against current common wisdom, but not giving up physical realism, the conclusion of the enquiry will be that classical physics and quantum physics can neither function nor even be conceived one without the other - in line with ideas attributed to e.g. Niels Bohr or Lev Landau.</description>

      <title>Raoul Gatto and Bruno Touschek's joint legacy in the rise of electron-positron physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raoul Gatto and Bruno Touschek's collaboration in the establishment of electron positron colliders as a fundamental discovery tool in particle physics will be illustrated. In particular, we will tell the little-known story of how Gatto and Touschek's pioneering vision combined to provide the theoretical foundations for AdA, the first matter-antimatter collider, and how their friendship with Wolfgang Pauli and Gerhard L\"uders was crucial to their understanding of the CPT theorem, the basis for AdA's success. We will see how these two exceptional scientists shaped physics between Rome and Frascati, from the proposal to build AdA and, soon after in 1961, the larger machine ADONE, to the discovery of the $J/\Psi$ particle in 1974. We will also highlight Gatto and Touschek's contribution in mentoring an extraordinary cohort of students and collaborators whose work contributed to the renaissance of Italian theoretical physics after the Second World War and to the establishment of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>The Arrow of Time is Alive and Well but Forbidden Under the Received View of Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This essay offers a meta-level analysis in the sociology and history of physics in the context of the so-called "Arrow of Time Problem" or "Two Times Problem," which asserts that the empirically observed directionality of time is in conflict with physical theory. I argue that there is actually no necessary conflict between physics and the arrow of time, and that the observed directionality of time is perfectly consistent with physics unconstrained by certain optional metaphysical, epistemological and methodological beliefs and practices characterizing the conventional or Received View.</description>

      <title>The birth of StatPhys: The 1949 Florence conference at the juncture of national and international physics reconstruction after World War II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spring 1949 about 70 physicists from eight countries met in Florence to discuss recent trends in statistical mechanics. This scientific gathering, co-organized by the Commission on Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the Italian Physical Society (SIF), initiated a tradition of IUPAP-sponsored international conferences on statistical mechanics that lasts to this day. In 1977, when this conference series took the name of StatPhys, the foundational role of the Florence conference was recognized by retrospectively naming it StatPhys1. This paper examines the dual scientific and social significance of the conference, situating it in the broader contexts of the post-World War II reconstruction in Italian physics and of the revitalization of the international science organization. Through an analysis of IUPAP archives and Italian records, we illustrate how the event's success hinged on the aligned objectives of its organizers. Internationally, it was instrumental in defining the scientific and organizational foundations for the activities of IUPAP commissions during a critical phase of IUPAP's history, when the Union was resurging on the international scene after the inactivity of the interwar period. Nationally, the conference served as a cornerstone in SIF's strategy to re-establish Italian physics' international stature and to aid the domestic revitalization of physics through the internationalization of its activities, notably of its flagship journal, \textit{Il Nuovo Cimento}. This analysis not only sheds light on the conference's impact but also informs recent discussions in the history of science about the multiple roles of international scientific conferences.</description>

      <title>A Note on Norton's Dome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.01719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Norton's Dome" is an example of a Newtonian system that violates the Lipschitz condition at a single point, leading to non-unique solutions (indeterminism). Here we reformulate this problem into a "weak" form (in the sense of distributions). In our description the indeterminism manifests through the problematic interpretation of initial conditions, since distributions (as linear functionals on the space of test functions) do not have values at individual points.</description>
