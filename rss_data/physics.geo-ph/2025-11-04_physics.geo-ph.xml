      <title>Diffusion Models Bridge Deep Learning and Physics in ENSO Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate long-range forecasting of the El \Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is vital for global climate prediction and disaster risk management. Yet, limited understanding of ENSO's physical mechanisms constrains both numerical and deep learning approaches, which often struggle to balance predictive accuracy with physical interpretability. Here, we introduce a data driven model for ENSO prediction based on conditional diffusion model. By constructing a probabilistic mapping from historical to future states using higher-order Markov chain, our model explicitly quantifies intrinsic uncertainty. The approach achieves extending lead times of state-of-the-art methods, resolving early development signals of the spring predictability barrier, and faithfully reproducing the spatiotemporal evolution of historical extreme events. The most striking implication is that our analysis reveals that the reverse diffusion process inherently encodes the classical recharge-discharge mechanism, with its operational dynamics exhibiting remarkable consistency with the governing principles of the van der Pol oscillator equation. These findings establish diffusion models as a new paradigm for ENSO forecasting, offering not only superior probabilistic skill but also a physically grounded theoretical framework that bridges data-driven prediction with deterministic dynamical systems, thereby advancing the study of complex geophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Shannon Entropy Estimator for the Characterization of Seismic-Volcanic Signals using Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volcanic regions have shaped human settlements for millennia, placing over 500 million people worldwide within close proximity to active volcanoes. Predicting eruptions that threaten both lives and property remains a critical challenge, given the complexity and diversity of seismic signals and recording formats. Effective early warning systems require tools that are not only powerful but also user-friendly, computationally efficient, and capable of handling large seismic datasets and complex mathematical and probabilistic models used in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. We present a Shannon Entropy Estimator for the Characterization of Seismic-Volcanic Signals using Python designed to meet these demands. Featuring intuitive graphical user interfaces and a low learning curve, the system enables real-time analysis of seismic data using four key metrics: Shannon Entropy, Kurtosis, Frequency Index, and Energy. These metrics provide robust insights into a volcanoes state across different stages, independently of the type of event (VT, VLP, Tremor, Hybrid, Explosions) or the data format (SAC, MSEED, SEISAN, etc.). In this work, the efficacy of this tool is demonstrated through the analysis and graphical presentation of these metrics using real seismic records from active volcanoes, providing concrete examples of its practical application. This approach allows reliable monitoring, accurate categorization, and early detection of critical changes in volcanic activity, supporting the development of predictive models and enhancing the effectiveness of early warning systems. This practical, low-cost solution meets the analytical needs of research institutes and observatories while contributing to the mitigation of volcanic hazards worldwide.</description>

      <title>An unsupervised posterior sampling framework for multi-purpose seismic data recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data restoration is a fundamental task in seismic exploration, yet remains challenging under complex and unknown degradations. Traditional model-driven or task-specific learning methods often require retraining for each degradation type and fail to generalize effectively to unseen field data.In this work, we introduce an unsupervised Posterior Sampling Framework (PSF) built upon Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) for unified seismic data restoration. PSF leverages a pre-trained unconditional SGMs as a seismic-aware generative prior and derives a generalized conditional score function linked to the forward operator of each inverse problem. This enables posterior sampling across different seismic restoration tasks without retraining or supervision. Additionally, an adaptive noise-level estimation mechanism is incorporated to dynamically regulate the noise suppression strength during sampling, enhancing flexibility under varying signal-to-noise ratios and degradation conditions.Extensive experiments on seismic denoising, interpolation, compressed sensing, and deconvolution demonstrate that PSF delivers high-quality samples and exhibits robust generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results highlight the potential of SGMs as a universal prior for seismic inverse problems and establish PSF as a flexible framework for unsupervised posterior inference across diverse degradation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Jacobi's solution for geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On Boxing Day, 1838, Jacobi found a solution to the problem of geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid, with the course of the geodesic and the distance along it given in terms of one-dimensional integrals. Here, a numerical implementation of this solution is described. This entails accurately evaluating the integrals and solving the resulting coupled system of equations. The inverse problem, finding the shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid, can then be solved using a similar method as for biaxial ellipsoids.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale assessment for managing coastal geomorphic changes in southwestern Lake Michigan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding coastal geomorphic change is essential for advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a multi-scale coastal management framework. In particular, characterization of coastal geomorphic change across multiple spatial and temporal scales can provide essential insights and context-specific knowledge that can inform and empower local communities. In this study, we present a multi-scale assessment of coastal geomorphic change in southwestern Lake Michigan in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Three spatial scales: county, reach, and transect and two temporal scales: long-term and short-term were examined using nine sets of historical aerial imagery spanning 1937 to 2020. The site-averaged long-term (1937-2020) change rates for the bluff crest, bluff toe, and shoreline were -0.22, -0.17, and -0.16 m/year, respectively. In the short term (1995-2020), the corresponding rates were -0.22, -0.15, and -0.32 m/year, indicating an increasing shoreline erosion in recent years. The coastal geomorphic changes at county, reach, and transect scales were further characterized, showing regional and localized distributions of coastal erosion in our study sites. The mechanisms driving coastal change,particularly wave impacts, were also examined to assess their correlation with coastal geomorphic change across different spatial scales. The results indicate that wave impacts influence coastal environments at certain scales more strongly than at others. Several erosion "hotspots" were examined to identify local factors contributing to severe site-specific erosion. Lastly, the spatial uniformity of coastal geomorphology was examined between the county and reach scales. Overall, the findings suggest that multi-scale analyses provide a valuable insight for effective management of coastal geomorphology.</description>

      <title>GEDICorrect: A Scalable Python Tool for Orbit-, Beam-, and Footprint-Level GEDI Geolocation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate geolocation is essential for the reliable use of GEDI LiDAR data in footprint-scale applications such as aboveground biomass modeling, data fusion, and ecosystem monitoring. However, residual geolocation errors arising from both systematic biases and random ISS-induced jitter can significantly affect the accuracy of derived vegetation and terrain metrics. The main goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a flexible, computationally efficient framework (GEDICorrect) that enables geolocation correction of GEDI data at the orbit, beam, and footprint levels. The framework integrates existing GEDI Simulator modules (gediRat and gediMetrics) and extends their functionality with flexible correction logic, multiple similarity metrics, adaptive footprint clustering, and optimized I/O handling. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence as the waveform similarity metric, GEDICorrect improved canopy height (RH95) accuracy from $R^2 = 0.61$ (uncorrected) to 0.74 with the orbit-level correction, and up to $R^2 = 0.78$ with the footprint-level correction, reducing RMSE from 2.62~m ($rRMSE = 43.13\%$) to 2.12~m ($rRMSE = 34.97\%$) at the orbit level, and 2.01~m ($rRMSE = 33.05\%$) at the footprint level. Terrain elevation accuracy also improved, decreasing RMSE by 0.34~m relative to uncorrected data and by 0.37~m compared to the GEDI Simulator baseline. In terms of computational efficiency, GEDICorrect achieved a $\sim2.4\times$ speedup over the GEDI Simulator in single-process mode (reducing runtime from $\sim84$~h to $\sim35$~h) and scaled efficiently to 24 cores, completing the same task in $\sim4.3$~h -- an overall $\sim19.5\times$ improvement. GEDICorrect offers a robust and scalable solution for improving GEDI geolocation accuracy while maintaining full compatibility with standard GEDI data products.</description>

      <title>Onset of habitable conditions on the Hadean Earth set by feedback between tides and greenhouse forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of the Moon-forming giant impact, the Hadean Earth's mantle and surface crystallized from a global magma ocean blanketed by a dense volatile-rich atmosphere. While prior studies have explored the thermal evolution of such early Earth scenarios under idealized, oxidizing conditions, the potential feedback between tidal heating driven by Earth--Moon orbital forcing and variable redox scenarios have not yet been explored in detail. We investigate whether tidal heating could have prolonged this early magma ocean phase and supported quasi-steady state epochs of global radiative equilibrium: periods of thermal balance between outgoing radiation and interior heat flux. Using the $\texttt{PROTEUS}$ simulation framework, we simulate Earth's early evolution under a range of plausible tidal power densities, oxygen fugacities, and volatile inventories. Our results suggest that feedback between tidal heating and atmospheric forcing can induce substantial variation in magma ocean lifetimes, from $\sim$30 Myr up to $\sim$500 Myr, sensitive to interior redox conditions. Global radiative equilibrium epochs commonly arise across this range, lasting from $\sim$2 to $\sim$320 Myr, and typically occur from 24 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Under oxidizing conditions, late-stage H$_2$O degassing promotes melt retention and sustained heating due to its significant contribution to greenhouse forcing. Weak tides increase the atmospheric abundance of H$_2$S and NH$_3$ and deplete CO. Therefore, the feedback between tides and atmospheric forcing induces a disequilibrium signature in the magma ocean atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Wave climate on the southwestern coast of Lake Michigan: Perspectives from wave directionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave directionality plays a critical role in shaping coastal conditions and influencing local livelihoods, underscoring the importance of conducting detailed analyses. This study examines directional wave climate along the southwestern coast of Lake Michigan from 1979 to 2023 using the Directional Wave Entropy (DWE). Directionality was characterized in terms of inter-annual trends, monthly patterns, spatial variation, and extreme wave conditions. Overall, results exhibited a strong bi-directionality, with dominant northern and southern wave systems along the coast of our study site. A few annual trends for the inter-annual wave climate were observed, and there is a clear seasonal variation such that bi-directionality increases in the summer and winter seasons. As for spatial variation of wave directionality, all locations in the study sites presented a bi-directional wave climate. The two dominant directions of wave directionality: northern and southern mean significant wave heights were also characterized in all locations of study sites as 0.566 and 0.563 meters. Furthermore, the extreme wave heights in the northern direction are significantly greater than the extreme waves in the southern direction. In summary, these findings suggest the importance of wave directionality on coastal structural design and coastal morphology management along the coast of our study site.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Seismic Waveform Generation using Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and synthesis of seismic waveforms are crucial for seismic-hazard assessment and earthquake-resistant infrastructure design. Existing prediction methods, such as ground-motion models and physics-based wave-field simulations, often fail to capture the full complexity of seismic wavefields, particularly at higher frequencies. This study introduces HighFEM, a novel, computationally efficient, and scalable (i.e., capable of generating many seismograms simultaneously) generative model for high-frequency seismic-waveform generation. Our approach leverages a spectrogram representation of the seismic-waveform data, which is reduced to a lower-dimensional manifold via an autoencoder. A state-of-the-art diffusion model is trained to generate this latent representation conditioned on key input parameters: earthquake magnitude, recording distance, site conditions, hypocenter depth, and azimuthal gap. The model generates waveforms with frequency content up to 50 Hz. Any scalar ground-motion statistic, such as peak ground-motion amplitudes and spectral accelerations, can be readily derived from the synthesized waveforms. We validate our model using commonly employed seismological metrics and performance metrics from image-generation studies. Our results demonstrate that the openly available model can generate realistic high-frequency seismic waveforms across a wide range of input parameters, even in data-sparse regions. For the scalar ground-motion statistics commonly used in seismic-hazard and earthquake-engineering studies, we show that our model accurately reproduces both the median trends of the real data and their variability. To evaluate and compare the growing number of these and similar Generative Waveform Models (GWMs), we argue that they should be openly available and included in community ground-motion-model evaluation efforts.</description>
