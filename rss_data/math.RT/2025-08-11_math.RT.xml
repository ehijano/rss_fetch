      <title>Quasi-Whittaker modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a general setting is proposed to define a class of modules over nonsemisimple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ induced by a nonperfect ideal $\mathfrak{p}$. This class of Lie algebras includes many well-known Lie algebras, and some of this class of modules are Whittaker modules and others are not. We call these modules quasi-Whittaker modules. By introducing a new concept: the Whittaker annihilator for universal quasi-Whittaker modules, we are able to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the irreducibility of the universal quasi-Whittaker modules. In the reducible case, we can obtain some maximal submodules. In particular, we classify the irreducible quasi-Whittaker modules for many Lie algebras, and obtain a lot of irreducible smooth $\mathcal{W}_n^+$-modules of height $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order relations of continuous cancellative t-subnorms are discussed. First, we present some necessary and sufficient conditions along with several interesting sufficient criteria for the comparability of continuous cancellative t-subnorms. Then we characterize the growth and boundedness of additive generators, which are used for the comparison of continuous cancellative t-subnorms.</description>

      <title>Strongly flat modules via universal localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-commutative version of strongly flat modules, which is based on the concept of universal localization introduced by Cohn. We consider a set $\sigma$ consisting of maps of finitely generated projective $R$-modules, where $R$ is not necessarily a commutative ring. Let $R_{\sigma}$ denote the universal localization of $R$ with respect to $\sigma$. The class of $\sigma$-strongly flat modules is defined as the left class in the cotorsion pair generated by $R_{\sigma}$. We examine the homotopy category of $\sigma$-strongly flat modules and demonstrate that the thick subcategory $\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$, consisting of acyclic complexes, wherein all syzygies are $\sigma$-strongly flat, forms a precovering class within this homotopy category. This implies that the quotient map from $\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})$ to $\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})/\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$ always has a fully faithful right adjoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binomial formulas for Schur polynomials and Jack polynomials were studied by Lascoux in 1978, and Kaneko, Okounkov--Olshanski and Lassalle in the 1990s. We prove that the associated binomial coefficients are monotone and derive some symmetric function inequalities, in particular, a Schur positivity and Jack positivity result. These inequalities are similar to those studied by Newton, Muirhead, Gantmacher, Cuttler--Greene--Skandera, Sra and Khare--Tao.</description>

      <title>Fast, Convex and Conditioned Network for Multi-Fidelity Vectors and Stiff Univariate Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning, especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude, achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.</description>

      <title>A refined twist on Hurwitz numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter refinement of the Jucys-Murphy theory, that we call the CJT-refinement, unifying Schur, zonal, and, conjecturally, Jack actions of the ring of symmetric functions on the Fock space. Applications of this formalism include a partial resolution of a recent conjecture of Coulter-Do, as well as cut-and-join recursion for $b$-Hurwitz numbers. The cut-and-join equations enable the derivation of the tropicalization of $b$--Hurwitz numbers. We also provide a first application of this tropical interpretation by answering an open problem of Chapuy-Do{\l}\k{e}ga on the polynomial structure of $b$-Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying crepant blow-ups of (compound) du Val singularities, we classify complexes of coherent sheaves which admit no negative self-extensions -- such a complex, up to flops and mutation equivalences, must either be (1) a module over a derived-equivalent algebra, or (2) a two-term extension of a coherent sheaf by skyscraper sheaves, or (3) a direct sum of shifts of skyscrapers. This translates into classifications of bricks, spherical objects, stability conditions, and algebraic t-structures in the local derived category; the lists populated by the homological minimal programme turn out exhaustive. We deduce that the Bridgeland stability manifold is connected, and that all basic tilting complexes on the variety (equivalently on the g-tame algebras derived-equivalent to it) are related by shifts and iterated mutation.</description>

      <title>Affine Springer fibers and depth zero L-packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.13123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a field $F=\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ splitting over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$. Following [KV,DR], a tamely unramified Langlands parameter $\lambda:W_F\to{}^L G(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})$ in general position gives rise to a finite set $\Pi_{\lambda}$ of irreducible admissible representations of $G(F)$, called the $L$-packet.
  The main goal of this work is to provide a geometric description of characters $\chi_{\pi}$ of $\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}$ and of their endoscopic linear combinations $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ in terms of homology of affine Springer fibers, thus establishing an analog of Lusztig conjectures in this case. Furthermore, each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ can be described as the trace of Frobenius function of a conjugation equivariant perverse sheaf on the loop group by the sheaf-function correspondence.
  As another application, we prove that the sum $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}:=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}}\chi_{\pi}$ is stable and show that the $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}$'s are compatible with inner twistings. More generally, we prove that each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ is $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda,\kappa}$-stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new homological dimension, called the Igusa-Todorov distance, is introduced to measure how far an Artin algebra is from being an Igusa-Todorov algebra. An upper bound for the dimension is established in terms of the Loewy length, leading to the conclusion that every Artin algebra has a finite Igusa-Todorov distance.Using this dimension, we derive an upper bound for the dimension of the singularity category. Furthermore, we investigate how the Igusa-Todorov distance behaves under various relationships between algebras. Specifically, we demonstrate that stable equivalences preserve the Igusa-Todorov distances for algebras without nodes, prove that it is an invariant under singular equivalence of Morita type with level, and establish bounds for the distances of algebras involved in a recollement of derived module categories. Consequently, the Igusa-Todorov distance is an invariant under derived equivalences of algebras.</description>

Abstract: We show coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. We further show the coordinate rings of (generalized) open Richardson varieties on the twisted product of flag varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. This includes, as special cases, reduced double Bruhat cells, Bott-Samelson varieties, braid varieties. Our results generalize various results by Casals--Gorsky--Gorsky--Le--Shen--Simental and Galashin--Lam--Sherman-Bennett--Speyer in finite types.</description>

      <title>Modulated categories and their representations via higher categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the 3-category $2\mathfrak{C}at$ whose objects are 2-categories, 1-morphisms are lax functors, 2-morphisms are lax transformations and 3-morphisms are modifications. The aim is to show that it carries interesting representation-theoretic information.
  Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small 1-category and $\mathfrak{B}im_k$ be the 2-category of bimodules over $k$-algebras, where $k$ is a commutative ring with identity. We call a covariant (resp. contravariant) pseudofunctor from $\mathcal{C}$ into $\mathfrak{B}im_k$ a modulation (resp. comodulation) on $\mathcal{C}$, define and study its representations. This framework provides a unified approach to investigate 2-representations of finite groups, modulated quivers and their representations, as well as presheaves of $k$-algebras and their modules. Moreover, several key constructions are natural ingredients in $2\mathfrak{C}at$, and thus it exhibits an interesting application of higher category theory to representation theory.</description>

Furthermore, we establish an explicit formula, called the Langlands branching rule, which gives the multiplicities in the decomposition of the character of a snake module of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$ into a sum of characters of irreducible representations of its Langlands dual algebra.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory for the free left-regular band and a q-analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine from an invariant theory viewpoint the monoid algebras for two monoids having large symmetry groups. The first monoid is the free left-regular band on $n$ letters, defined on the set of all injective words, that is, the words with at most one occurrence of each letter. This monoid carries the action of the symmetric group. The second monoid is one of its $q$-analogues, considered by K. Brown, carrying an action of the finite general linear group. In both cases, we show that the invariant subalgebras are semisimple commutative algebras, and characterize them using Stirling and $q$-Stirling numbers.
  We then use results from the theory of random walks and random-to-top shuffling to decompose the entire monoid algebra into irreducibles, simultaneously as a module over the invariant ring and as a group representation. Our irreducible decompositions are described in terms of derangement symmetric functions introduced by D\'esarm\'enien and Wachs.</description>

      <title>Support theories for non-Noetherian tensor triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the support theory of Benson--Iyengar--Krause to the non-Noetherian setting by introducing a new notion of small support for modules. This enables us to prove that the stable module category of a finite group is canonically stratified by the action of the Tate cohomology ring, despite the fact that this ring is rarely Noetherian. In the tensor triangular context, we compare the support theory proposed by W. Sanders (which extends the Balmer--Favi support theory beyond the weakly Noetherian setting) with our generalized BIK support theory. When the Balmer spectrum is homeomorphic to the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, the two support theories coincide as do their associated theories of stratification. We also prove a negative result which states that the Balmer--Favi--Sanders support theory can only stratify categories whose spectra are weakly Noetherian. This provides additional justification for the weakly Noetherian hypothesis in the work of Barthel, Heard and B. Sanders. On the other hand, the detection property and the local-to-global principle remain interesting in the general setting.</description>

      <title>Orders of commutators and Products of conjugacy classes in finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, let $x\in G$ and let $p$ be a prime. We prove that the commutator $[x,g]$ is a $p$-element for every $g\in G$ if and only if $x$ is central modulo $O_p(G),$ where $O_p(G)$ denotes the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. This result simultaneously generalizes some variants of both the Baer-Suzuki theorem and Glauberman's $Z_p^*$-theorem. Furthermore, we show that if $x\in G$ is a $p$-element and there exists an integer $m\ge 1$ such that for all $g\in G$, either $[x,g]=1$ or the order of $[x,g] $ is $m$ for every $g\in G$, then the subgroup generated by the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ is solvable. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Beltr\'an, Felipe and Melchor, which states that if $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ such that the product $K^{-1}K=1\cup D\cup D^{-1}$ for some conjugacy class $D$ of $G$, then the subgroup generated by $K$ is solvable.</description>
