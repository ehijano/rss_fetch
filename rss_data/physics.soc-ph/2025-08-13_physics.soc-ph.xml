      <title>Financial and symbolic incentives promote 'green' charging choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromobility can contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions if usage behavior is aligned with the increasing availability of renewable energy. To achieve this, smart navigation systems can be used to inform drivers of optimal charging times and locations. Yet, required flexibility may impart time penalties. We investigate the impact of financial and symbolic incentive schemes to counteract these additional costs. In a laboratory experiment with real-life time costs, we find that monetary and symbolic incentives are both effective in changing behavior towards 'greener' charging choices, while we find no significant statistical difference between them.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required to safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, stimulation is widely used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are conceptually meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Legal Tech Environmental Integration for Emergency Pharmaceutical Logistics with Entropy Modulated Collapse and Multilevel Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergency pharmaceutical logistics during rapid-onset disasters must balance timeliness, legal compliance, and environmental uncertainty. We present a hybrid framework that co-designs quantum-inspired decision dynamics, embedded legal constraints, and blockchain-verified environmental feedback. Candidate routes are modeled as a superposed state whose collapse is governed by entropy modulation-delaying commitment under ambiguity and accelerating resolution when coherent signals emerge. Legal statutes act as real-time projection operators shaping feasible choices, while environmental decoherence cues adjust confidence and path viability. The core engine is situated within a multilevel governance and mechanism design architecture, establishing clear roles, accountability channels, and audit trails. Large-scale simulations in wildfire scenarios demonstrate substantial gains over conventional baselines in latency, compliance, and robustness, while preserving interpretability and fairness adaptation. The resulting system offers a deployable, governance-aware infrastructure where law and physical risk jointly inform emergency routing decisions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Round Robin: Evaluating Competitiveness in UEFA's New Champions League Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, UEFA changed the group stage of its international soccer competitions to an incomplete round robin tournament. Previously, teams were divided into groups, each playing a double round robin tournament with a resulting ranking table. In contrast, the new format has all teams competing in one league, producing a single ranking. We investigate the effect of the new format on the expected number of noncompetitive matches in the UEFA Champions League. A match is noncompetitive if the prize of one or both opponents is fixed regardless of the match outcome, or if there exists an opportunity for collusion. We show that the incomplete round robin format results in more competitive matches compared to the old group format.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Spreading with Co-infection on Long-Range Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time co-infection epidemic model on spatial networks incorporating both random and long-range interactions. Using numerical analysis, we investigate how the co-infection recovery rate ($\mu$), the interaction distance decay exponent ($\alpha$), and network connectivity parameters affect epidemic persistence. Our results show that lower values of ($\mu$) facilitate long-term survival, and that the presence of long-range connections ($\alpha &gt; 0$) robustly enhances persistence, often outweighing the effects of co-infection dynamics and local connectivity. These findings highlight nontrivial threshold behavior and the critical role of long-range structure in heterogeneous, nonlocal epidemic systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Perspectives on Urban Inequality: A Systematic Review of GIS-Based Methodologies and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban inequality, as reflected by uneven spatial allocations of resources, services, and opportunities, has arisen as a major topic for quantitative research and policy intervention. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide a solid framework for quantifying, analyzing, and visualizing these disparities; nevertheless, the many statistical approaches used in different studies have not been completely pooled. This analysis looks at 201 peer-reviewed articles published between 1996 and 2024, obtained from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, that use GIS-based approaches to investigate intra-urban differences. Eligibility was limited to English-language, peer-reviewed research that focused on urban settings, with the screening technique following the PRISMA methodology. The review identifies five key theme domains: accessibility, green space, health-related disparity, socioeconomic status, and open space provision. In the literature, statistical and network-based approaches, such as spatial clustering, regression analysis, and bibliometric mapping, are critical for identifying patterns and driving thematic synthesis. Although accessibility remains the core focus, the subject has expanded to include a variety of indicators such as environmental justice and health vulnerability, aided by advances in data sources and spatial analytics. Ongoing methodological issues include spatial concentration in industrialized countries and the limited use of longitudinal or composite measurements. The report concludes by outlining research priorities and practical recommendations for improving statistical rigor, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, and assuring policy relevance in GIS-based urban inequality studies.</description>

      <title>The 2R-Conjecture for the Hegselmann--Krause Model: A Proof in Expectation and New Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hegselmann--Krause models are localized, distributed averaging dynamics on spatial data. A key aspect of these dynamics is that they lead to cluster formation, which has important applications in geographic information systems, dynamic clustering algorithms, opinion dynamics, and social networks. For these models, the key questions are whether a fixed point exists and, if so, characterizing it. In this work, we establish new results towards the "2R-Conjecture" for the Hegselmann--Krause model, for which no meaningful progress, or even any precise statement, has been made since its introduction in 2007. This conjecture relates to the structure of the fixed point when there are a large number of agents per unit space. We provide, among other results, a proof in expectation and a statement of a stronger result that is supported by simulation. The key methodological contribution is to consider the dynamics as an infinite-dimensional problem on the space of point processes, rather than on finitely many points. This enables us to leverage stationarity, shift invariance, and certain other symmetries to obtain the results. These techniques do not have finite-dimensional analogs.</description>

      <title>Coordinating cooperation in stag-hunt game: Emergence of evolutionarily stable procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are bounded rational at best and this, we argue, has worked in their favour in the hunter-gatherer society where emergence of a coordinated action, leading to cooperation, is otherwise the standard stag-hunt dilemma (when individuals are rational). In line with the fact the humans strive for developing self-reputation by having less propensity to cheat than to be cheated, we observe that the payoff structure of the stag-hunt game appropriately modifies to that of coordination-II game. Subsequently, within the paradigm of evolutionary game theory, we establish that a population -- consisting of procedural rational players (a type of bounded rationality) -- is unequivocally evolutionarily stable against emergence of more rational strategies in coordination-II game. The cooperation is, thus, shown to have been established by evolutionary forces picking less rational individuals.</description>

      <title>Non-participant externalities reshape the evolution of altruistic punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While voluntary participation is a key mechanism that enables altruistic punishment to emerge, its explanatory power typically rests on the common assumption that non-participants have no impact on the public good. Yet, given the decentralized nature of voluntary participation, opting out does not necessarily preclude individuals from influencing the public good. Here, we revisit the role of voluntary participation by allowing non-participants to exert either positive or negative impacts on the public good. Using evolutionary analysis in a well-mixed finite population, we find that positive externalities from non-participants lower the synergy threshold required for altruistic punishment to dominate. In contrast, negative externalities raise this threshold, making altruistic punishment harder to sustain. Notably, when non-participants have positive impacts, altruistic punishment thrives only if non-participation is incentivized, whereas under negative impacts, it can persist even when non-participation is discouraged. Our findings reveal that efforts to promote altruistic punishment must account for the active role of non-participants, whose influence can make or break collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>Ideometrics: The Science of Generating, Evaluating and Prioritising Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and outlines a new integrative field, Ideometrics. It is the systematic science of generating, evaluating, and prioritising ideas, based on the proposed sense of ideas and assigning value to information by the brain. Drawing on the structure based on the three fundamental aims, our work maps out the landscape of more than 70 methodologies that were applied to address those three aims across time, disciplines, and epistemic paradigms. The part on generating ideas synthesises classical creativity techniques, participatory approaches and computational innovations. The part on evaluating ideas explores the wide ranging methods developed to this end. The part on prioritising ideas assesses different prioritisation techniques. A central argument of this paper is that although these methods arose separately and independently, most often isolated by disciplinary boundaries, they share remarkable conceptual and structural similarities. Recurring features include creative ideation, aggregation of input, balancing of subjective and objective criteria, embedded value assumptions and iterative refinement. There is also a more recent trend of application of statistical inference and introduction of artificial intelligence, making Ideometrics increasingly quantitative, testable, replicable and digital. These insights suggest the feasibility and necessity of unifying these traditions under a common scientific framework, establishing Ideometrics as a rigorous and practically useful field of scientific enquiry. We believe that this is the first systematic attempt to document, compare, and synthesise the full spectrum of methodologies used to generate, evaluate and prioritise ideas. Our framework is flexible and designed to evolve, to assist in identifying the ideas that could have the most positive future impact in a way that is transparent, inclusive, and analytically sound.</description>

      <title>Statistical Methodologies for Urban Morphology Indicators: A Comprehensive Review of Quantitative Approaches to Sustainable Urban Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban morphology has a significant impact on sustainable urban outcomes in the ecological, social, and economic sectors. Nonetheless, academics lack clarity and consensus on how to quantify urban morphology indicators, which impedes multidisciplinary research and the creation of integrated sustainable solutions. This comprehensive study develops a detailed taxonomy of urban form indicators related to sustainability, describes quantitative approaches for investigating the linkages between urban morphology and sustainability, and examines research trends, gaps, and future directions. A review of 89 carefully selected studies showed 365 distinct urban morphology measures, with significant variation in names, interpretations, and data formats. The measures were divided into six categories: urban tissue configuration, roadway network, building plot characteristics, land use, natural elements and greenspace, and urban expansion, each with its own subclass. The study indicates that, even though urban morphology is intrinsically spatial, spatial modeling is rarely used to investigate its relationships with sustainability. The research shows a regional bias, with insufficient representation of studies focusing on the Global South and natural elements. This synthesis calls for a standardized classification framework as well as more broad, spatially explicit techniques to foster multidisciplinary research and support effective policy and planning for sustainable urban development.</description>

      <title>Ideological polarization in static networks: A multidimensional approach for opinion alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization, defined as the emergence of sharply divided groups with opposing and often extreme views, is an increasingly prominent feature of modern societies. While many studies analyze this phenomenon in the context of single issues, such as public opinion on abortion or immigration, this approach overlooks that political and social attitudes rarely develop in isolation. Instead, many issues are interconnected, shaped by overarching ideological frameworks that guide interpretations and position-taking across multiple topics. These frameworks produce coherent yet polarized worldviews that reinforce group boundaries. In this work, we propose and study a multi-topic opinion dynamics model that captures these interdependencies. Each issue is represented as a separate dimension in a shared opinion space, allowing us to model not only attitudes toward individual topics but also the structure of ideological alignment across them. A central feature is topic correlation, which enables us to explore how polarization emerges when opinions on one issue influence attitudes on others. The model also incorporates homophily, a mechanism where individuals are more likely to interact with those similar to themselves. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the model by identifying its most relevant fixed points, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. We then examine how the multidimensional opinion space shapes the emergence and stability of polarization, and apply the model to empirical data from the American National Election Studies, interpreting observed opinion patterns within our framework.</description>

      <title>Identification of pressure points in modern power systems using transfer entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of variable energy resources -- e.g., solar, wind, and hydro -- and end-use electrification increase modern energy systems' weather-dependence. Identifying critical infrastructure constraining the power grid's ability to meet electricity demand under weather-induced shocks and stressors is essential for understanding risks and guiding adaptation. We use transfer entropy to identify predictive pressure points: grid components whose utilization patterns provide early signals of downstream power shortages. We apply this method to simulations of New York State's proposed future grid under various meteorological and technological scenarios, showing that pressure points often arise from complex, system-wide interactions between generation, transmission, and demand. While transfer entropy does not support conclusions about causality, the identified pressure points align with known bottlenecks and offer insight into failure pathways. Furthermore, these pressure points are not easily predicted by high-level scenario features alone, underscoring the need for holistic and adaptive approaches to reliability planning in power systems with intermittent resources.</description>

      <title>Economy and Geography Shape the Collective Attention of Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks are commonly used to explore human behavior. However, previous studies largely overlooked the geographical and economic factors embedded in collective attention. To address this, we construct attention networks from time-series data for the United States and China, each a key economic power in the West and the East, respectively. We reveal a strong macroscale correlation between urban attention and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). At the mesoscale, community detection of attention networks shows that high-GDP cities consistently act as core nodes within their communities and occupy strategic geographic positions. At the microscale, structural hole theory identifies these cities as key connectors between communities, with influence proportional to economic output. Overlapping community detection further reveals tightly connected urban clusters, prompting us to introduce geographic and topic-based metrics, which show that closely linked cities are spatially proximate and topically coherent. Of course, not all patterns were consistent across regions. A notable distinction emerged in the relationship between population size and urban attention, which was evident in the United States but absent in China. Building on these insights, we integrate key variables reflecting GDP, geography, and scenic resources into regression model to cross-verify the influence of economic and geographic factors on collective user attention, and unexpectedly discover that a composite index of population, access, and scenery fails to account for cross-city variations in attention. Our study bridges the gap between economic prosperity and geographic centrality in shaping urban attention landscapes.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of allocating scarce societal resources of different types (e.g., permanent housing, deceased donor kidneys for transplantation, ventilators) to heterogeneous allocatees on a waitlist (e.g., people experiencing homelessness, individuals suffering from end-stage renal disease, Covid-19 patients) based on their observed covariates. We leverage administrative data collected in deployment to design an online policy that maximizes expected outcomes while satisfying budget constraints, in the long run. Our proposed policy waitlists each individual for the resource maximizing the difference between their estimated mean treatment outcome and the estimated resource dual-price or, roughly, the opportunity cost of using the resource. Resources are then allocated as they arrive, in a first-come first-serve fashion. We demonstrate that our data-driven policy almost surely asymptotically achieves the expected outcome of the optimal out-of-sample policy under mild technical assumptions. We extend our framework to incorporate various fairness constraints. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problem of designing policies for allocating scarce housing resources to people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles based on data from the homeless management information system. In particular, we show that using our policies improves rates of exit from homelessness by 5.16% and that policies that are fair in either allocation or outcomes by race come at a very low price of fairness.</description>
