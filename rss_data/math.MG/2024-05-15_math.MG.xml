      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)^2$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity one RCD-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces $(X,d,\mathfrak{m})$ with group actions by isometries preserving the reference measure $\mathfrak{m}$ and whose orbit space has dimension one, i.e. cohomogeneity one actions. To this end we prove a Slice Theorem asserting that each slice at a point is homeomorphic to a non-negatively curved $\mathsf{RCD}$-space. Under the assumption that $X$ is non-collapsed we further show that the slices are homeomorphic to metric cones over homogeneous spaces with $\mathrm{Ric} \geq 0$. As a consequence we obtain complete topological structural results and a principal orbit representation theorem. Conversely, we show how to construct new $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces from a cohomogeneity one group diagram, giving a complete description of $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of cohomogeneity one. As an application of these results we obtain the classification of cohomogeneity one, non-collapsed $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of essential dimension at most $4$.</description>

      <title>Is every triangle a trajectory of an elliptical billiard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named ``Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

      <title>Fat minors cannot be thinned (by quasi-isometries)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We disprove the conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu that a length space (or graph) with no $K$-fat $H$ minor is quasi-isometric to a graph with no $H$ minor. Our counterexample is furthermore not quasi-isometric to a graph with no 2-fat $H$ minor or a length space with no $H$ minor. On the other hand, we show that the following weakening holds: any graph with no $K$-fat $H$ minor is quasi-isometric to a graph with no $3$-fat $H$ minor.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of cyclic polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization is a construction of a class of polytopes such that the polytopes have some of their properties.The best known example is the class of neighbourly polytopes. Cyclic polytopes have explicit facet structures, important properties and applications in different branches of mathematics. In the past few decades, generalizations of their combinatorial properties have yielded new classes of polytopes that also have explicit facet structures and useful applications. We present an overview of these generalizations along with some applications of the resultant polytopes, and some possible approaches to other generalizations.</description>

      <title>Projected images of the Sierpinski tetrahedron and other layered fractal imaginary cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13065v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sierpinski tetrahedron has a remarkable property: It is projected to squares in three orthogonal directions, and moreover, to sets with positive Lebesgue measures in numerous directions. This paper proposes a method for characterizing directions along which the Sierpinski tetrahedron and other similar fractal 3D objects are projected to sets with positive measures. We apply this methodology to layered fractal imaginary cubes and achieve a comprehensive characterization for them. Layered fractal imaginary cubes are defined as attractors of iterated function systems with layered structures, and they are projected to squares in three orthogonal directions. Within this class, the Sierpinski tetrahedron, T-fractal, and H-fractal stand out as exemplary cases.</description>
