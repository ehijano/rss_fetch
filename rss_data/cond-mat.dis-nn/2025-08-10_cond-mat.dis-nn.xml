      <title>Control of dynamical localization in atom-optics kicked rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom-optics kicked rotor represents an experimentally realizable version of the paradigmatic quantum kicked rotor system. After a short initial diffusive phase the cloud settles down to a stationary state due to the onset of dynamical localization. In this work we realise an enhancement of localization by modification of the kick sequence. We experimentally implement the modification to this system in which the sign of the kick sequence is flipped by allowing for a free evolution of the wavepackets for half the Talbot time after every $M$ kicks. Depending on the value of $M$, this modified system displays a combination of enhanced diffusion followed by asymptotic localization. This is explained as resulting from two competing processes -- localization induced by standard kicked rotor type kicks, and diffusion induced by half Talbot time evolution. The evolving states display a localized but non-exponential wave function profiles. This provides another route to quantum control in kicked rotor class of systems. The numerical simulations agree well with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Low dimensional dynamics of a sparse balanced synaptic network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetics of a balanced network of neurons with a sparse grid of synaptic links is well representable by the stochastic dynamics of a generic neuron subject to an effective shot noise. The rate of delta-pulses of the noise is determined self-consistently from the probability density of the neuron states. Importantly, the most sophisticated (but robust) collective regimes of the network do not allow for the diffusion approximation, which is routinely adopted for a shot noise in mathematical neuroscience. These regimes can be expected to be biologically relevant. For the kinetics equations of the complete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine phase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both time-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current. The low dimensional model is examined with numerical simulations and found to be accurate for time-independent states and dynamic response to a periodic modulation deep into the parameter domain where the diffusion approximation is not applicable. The accuracy of a low dimensional model indicates and explains a low embedding dimensionality of the macroscopic collective dynamics of the network. The reduced model can be instrumental for theoretical studies of inhibitory-excitatory balances neural networks.</description>

      <title>Active Particle Doping Suppresses Brittle Failure in Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrastable glasses are known for their exceptional mechanical stability but often fail in a brittle manner, typically marked by the formation of shear bands when subjected to shear deformation. An open question is how shear banding is affected by active particles. Here, we address this issue by investigating ultrastable glasses that are doped with self-propelled particles (SPPs) that perform run-and-tumble motions. In the presence of active particles we find a crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous yielding. Through extensive computer simulations of a polydisperse model, which is capable of producing ultrastable glasses using swap Monte Carlo Methods, we demonstrate the progressive emergence of multiple shear bands under activity, leading to continuous and delayed yielding. Interestingly, we uncover a compensatory relationship between active forces and global shear rates: a rise in one can offset a decline in the other, arising from the isomorphic-like behavior exhibited by different combinations of active forces and strain rates. We also identify a non-monotonic relationship between yielding and persistence time: while the yield stress increases at shorter persistence times with increasing active forces, it tends to decrease with longer persistence times. This observation highlights a tunable range of activity that can modify the yielding mode. Lastly, we show that the spacing between shear bands diminishes in a power law manner as the magnitude of the active force increases.</description>

      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a comprehensive picture of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks.</description>

      <title>The convex structure of the Parisi formula for multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the free energy of mean-field multi-species spin glasses with convex covariance function. For such models with $D$ species, the Parisi formula is known to be valid, and expresses the limit free energy as a supremum over monotone probability measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^D$. We show here that one can transform this representation into a supremum over all probability measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^D$ of a concave functional. We then deduce that the Parisi formula admits a unique maximizer. Using convex-duality arguments, we also obtain a new representation of the free energy as an infimum over martingales in a Wiener space.</description>

      <title>Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing gradients of a cost function is central to design-based optimization and machine learning algorithms. Equilibrium propagation provides an exact method to compute gradients in hardware by exploiting the inherent physical laws. The locality of these algorithms, in conjunction with local updates, enables mechanical and electronic systems that autonomously learn a function. We extend these methods to damped dynamical systems operating in the linear regime, such as mechanical structures obeying damped Newtonian dynamics and RLC circuits. By introducing an effective action whose extremum corresponds to the underlying dynamics, we derive local learning rules. This approach applies both to problems with periodic boundary conditions and to those with resting initial conditions. We demonstrate the viability of our method in mechanical and electronic systems and explore novel functionality such as classifying temporal sound signals. Our work opens the door to intelligent materials that process dynamical signals, enabling temporal computations, passive and active sensors, and materials that act as frequency-dependent filters.</description>
