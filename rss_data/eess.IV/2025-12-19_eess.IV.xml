      <title>Keep the Core: Adversarial Priors for Significance-Preserving Brain MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is constrained by sparse pathological annotations. Existing augmentation strategies, from conventional transforms to random masking for self-supervision, are feature-agnostic: they often corrupt critical diagnostic semantics or fail to prioritize essential features. We introduce "Keep the Core," a novel data-centric paradigm that uses adversarial priors to guide both augmentation and masking in a significance-preserving manner. Our approach uses SAGE (Sparse Adversarial Gated Estimator), an offline module identifying minimal tokens whose micro-perturbation flips segmentation boundaries. SAGE forges the Token Importance Map $W$ by solving an adversarial optimization problem to maximally degrade performance, while an $\ell_1$ sparsity penalty encourages a compact set of sensitive tokens. The online KEEP (Key-region Enhancement \&amp; Preservation) module uses $W$ for a two-pronged augmentation strategy: (1) Semantic-Preserving Augmentation: High-importance tokens are augmented, but their original pixel values are strictly restored. (2) Guided-Masking Augmentation: Low-importance tokens are selectively masked for an $\text{MAE}$-style reconstruction, forcing the model to learn robust representations from preserved critical features. "Keep the Core" is backbone-agnostic with no inference overhead. Extensive experiments show SAGE's structured priors and KEEP's region-selective mechanism are highly complementary, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation robustness and generalization on 2D medical datasets.</description>

      <title>BioimageAIpub: a toolbox for AI-ready bioimaging data publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern bioimage analysis approaches are data hungry, making it necessary for researchers to scavenge data beyond those collected within their (bio)imaging facilities. In addition to scale, bioimaging datasets must be accompanied with suitable, high-quality annotations and metadata. Although established data repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR) and BioImage Archive offer rich metadata, their contents typically cannot be directly consumed by image analysis tools without substantial data wrangling. Such a tedious assembly and conversion of (meta)data can account for a dedicated amount of time investment for researchers, hindering the development of more powerful analysis tools. Here, we introduce BioimageAIpub, a workflow that streamlines bioimaging data conversion, enabling a seamless upload to HuggingFace, a widely used platform for sharing machine learning datasets and models.</description>

      <title>SNIC: Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced denoising algorithms require large, high-quality datasets. Physics-based, statistical noise models can create such datasets by realistically simulating noise in digital images. However, there is little information on the correct way to calibrate and tune these heteroscedastic models, and a lack of published datasets using them. In this paper, we explore the process of building high-quality heteroscedastic noise models. Our methods produce realistic synthesized noisy images, in both RAW and TIFF formats. Our synthesized noisy images achieve comparable LPIPS results to real noisy images, and greatly outperform those created with manufacturer-provided DNG noise models both in LPIPS and when tested with a state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising model. Using our approach, we created the Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration dataset (SNIC) containing over 6000 noisy images, comprising 30 scenes from four sensors, including two smartphone sensors, a point-and-shoot, and a DSLR. SNIC is the first synthesized noisy image dataset provided in both RAW and TIFF format.</description>

      <title>In search of truth: Evaluating concordance of AI-based anatomy segmentation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose AI-based methods for anatomy segmentation can help automate characterization of large imaging datasets. The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results. The comparison shows excellent agreement segmenting some (e.g., lung) but not all structures (e.g., some models produce invalid vertebrae or rib segmentations). Conclusions The resources developed are linked from https://imagingdatacommons.github.io/segmentation-comparison/ including segmentation harmonization scripts, summary plots, and visualization tools. This work assists in model evaluation in absence of ground truth, ultimately enabling informed model selection.</description>

      <title>MCR-VQGAN: A Scalable and Cost-Effective Tau PET Synthesis Approach for Alzheimer's Disease Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it visualizes and quantifies neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Single-View Tomographic Reconstruction Using Learned Primal Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Learned Primal Dual (LPD) method has shown promising results in various tomographic reconstruction modalities, particularly under challenging acquisition restrictions such as limited viewing angles or a limited number of views. We investigate the performance of LPD in a more extreme case: single-view tomographic reconstructions of axially-symmetric targets. This study considers two modalities: the first assumes low-divergence or parallel X-rays. The second models a cone-beam X-ray imaging testbed. For both modalities, training data is generated using closed-form integral transforms, or physics-based ray-tracing software, then corrupted with blur and noise. Our results are then compared against common numerical inversion methodologies.</description>

      <title>A Fast Volumetric Capture and Reconstruction Pipeline for Dynamic Point Clouds and Gaussian Splats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast and efficient volumetric capture and reconstruction system that processes either RGB-D or RGB-only input to generate 3D representations in the form of point clouds and Gaussian splats. For Gaussian splat reconstructions, we took the GPS-Gaussian regressor and improved it, enabling high-quality reconstructions with minimal overhead. The system is designed for easy setup and deployment, supporting in-the-wild operation under uncontrolled illumination and arbitrary backgrounds, as well as flexible camera configurations, including sparse setups, arbitrary camera numbers and baselines. Captured data can be exported in standard formats such as PLY, MPEG V-PCC, and SPLAT, and visualized through a web-based viewer or Unity/Unreal plugins. A live on-location preview of both input and reconstruction is available at 5-10 FPS. We present qualitative findings focused on deployability and targeted ablations. The complete framework is open-source, facilitating reproducibility and further research.</description>

      <title>Secure AI-Driven Super-Resolution for Real-Time Mixed Reality Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive formats such as 360{\deg} and 6DoF point cloud videos require high bandwidth and low latency, posing challenges for real-time AR/VR streaming. This work focuses on reducing bandwidth consumption and encryption/decryption delay, two key contributors to overall latency. We design a system that downsamples point cloud content at the origin server and applies partial encryption. At the client, the content is decrypted and upscaled using an ML-based super-resolution model. Our evaluation demonstrates a nearly linear reduction in bandwidth/latency, and encryption/decryption overhead with lower downsampling resolutions, while the super-resolution model effectively reconstructs the original full-resolution point clouds with minimal error and modest inference time.</description>

      <title>Learning High-Quality Initial Noise for Single-View Synthesis with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhihao0512/EDN.</description>

      <title>Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03780v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>StructDiff: Structure-aware Diffusion Model for 3D Fine-grained Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving medical imaging data scarcity through semantic image generation has attracted growing attention in recent years. However, existing generative models mainly focus on synthesizing whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing limited capability in reproducing fine-grained anatomical details. Due to the stringent requirement of topological consistency and the complex 3D morphological heterogeneity of medical data, accurately reconstructing fine-grained anatomical details remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, we propose StructDiff, a Structure-aware Diffusion Model for fine-grained 3D medical image synthesis, which enables precise generation of topologically complex anatomies. In addition to the conventional mask-based guidance, StructDiff further introduces a paired image-mask template to guide the generation process, providing structural constrains and offering explicit knowledge of mask-to-image correspondence. Moreover, a Mask Generation Module (MGM) is designed to enrich mask diversity and alleviate the scarcity of high-quality reference masks. Furthermore, we propose a Confidence-aware Adaptive Learning (CAL) strategy based on Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV), which mitigates uncertainty introduced by imperfect synthetic data when transferring to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StructDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of topological consistency and visual realism, and significantly boosts downstream segmentation performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>TransUNet-GradCAM: A Hybrid Transformer-U-Net with Self-Attention and Explainable Visualizations for Foot Ulcer Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring. However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we employ the TransUNet architecture, a hybrid framework that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net structure. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution. We trained the model on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset using a robust augmentation pipeline and a hybrid loss function to mitigate class imbalance. On the internal validation set, the model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (F1-score) of 0.8886 using an optimized threshold of 0.4843. Crucially, to assess generalizability, we performed external validation on two independent datasets: the AZH Wound Care Center dataset (n=278) and the Medetec dataset (n=152). Without any retraining, the model achieved Dice scores of 0.6209 and 0.7850, respectively, demonstrating robust zero-shot transferability to unseen clinical domains. Furthermore, clinical utility analysis revealed a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.9749) between predicted and ground-truth wound areas. These outcomes demonstrate that our approach effectively integrates global and local feature extraction, offering a reliable, effective, and explainable solution for automated foot ulcer assessment.</description>

Abstract: This abstract presents our solution (Team Westwood) for mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification in the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge. For mitosis detection, we trained an nnUNetV2 for initial mitosis candidate screening with high sensitivity, followed by a random forest classifier ensembling predictions of three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and EfficientNetV2-s. For the atypical mitosis classification, we trained another random forest classifier ensembling the predictions of three CNNs: EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and InceptionV3. On the preliminary test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.7450 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8722 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification. On the final test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.6972 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8242 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification.</description>

      <title>Bayesian model selection and misspecification testing in imaging inverse problems only from noisy and partial measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection accuracy with a low computational cost.</description>

Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.</description>

      <title>FARM: Fine-Tuning Geospatial Foundation Models for Intra-Field Crop Yield Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper introduces FARM: Fine-tuning Agricultural Regression Models, a deep learning framework designed for high-resolution, intra-field canola yield prediction. FARM leverages a pre-trained, large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense, pixel-level (30 m) yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Canadian Prairies, FARM achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.44 and an R^2 of 0.81. Using an independent high-resolution yield monitor dataset, we further show that fine-tuning FARM on limited ground-truth labels outperforms training the same architecture from scratch, confirming the benefit of pre-training on large, upsampled county-level data for data-scarce precision agriculture. These results represent improvement over baseline architectures like 3D-CNN and DeepYield, which highlight the effectiveness of fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By providing a continuous, high-resolution output, FARM offers a more actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring.</description>
