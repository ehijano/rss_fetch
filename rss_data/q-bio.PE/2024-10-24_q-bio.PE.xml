      <title>Disease Outbreak Detection and Forecasting: A Review of Methods and Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious diseases occur when pathogens from other individuals or animals infect a person, resulting in harm to both individuals and society as a whole. The outbreak of such diseases can pose a significant threat to human health. However, early detection and tracking of these outbreaks have the potential to reduce the mortality impact. To address these threats, public health authorities have endeavored to establish comprehensive mechanisms for collecting disease data. Many countries have implemented infectious disease surveillance systems, with the detection of epidemics being a primary objective. The clinical healthcare system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional groups, and collaborating governmental entities all play pivotal roles within this system. Moreover, nowadays, search engines and social media platforms can serve as valuable tools for monitoring disease trends. The Internet and social media have become significant platforms where users share information about their preferences and relationships. This real-time information can be harnessed to gauge the influence of ideas and societal opinions, making it highly useful across various domains and research areas, such as marketing campaigns, financial predictions, and public health, among others. This article provides a review of the existing standard methods developed by researchers for detecting outbreaks using time series data. These methods leverage various data sources, including conventional data sources and social media data or Internet data sources. The review particularly concentrates on works published within the timeframe of 2015 to 2022.</description>

      <title>How host mobility patterns shape antigenic escape during viral-immune co-evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viruses like influenza have long coevolved with host immune systems, gradually shaping the evolutionary trajectory of these pathogens. Host immune systems develop immunity against circulating strains, which in turn avoid extinction by exploiting antigenic escape mutations that render new strains immune from existing antibodies in the host population. Infected hosts are also mobile, which can spread the virus to regions without developed host immunity, offering additional reservoirs for viral growth. While the effects of migration on long term stability have been investigated, we know little about how antigenic escape coupled with migration changes the survival and spread of emerging viruses. By considering the two processes on equal footing, we show that on short timescales an intermediate host mobility rate increases the survival probability of the virus through antigenic escape. We show that more strongly connected migratory networks decrease the survival probability of the virus. Using data from high traffic airports we argue that current human migration rates are beneficial for viral survival.</description>

      <title>Tipping points in fitness landscape of heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting fitness of biologically-active populations, communities or systems in fluctuating environments is a long-standing challenge. Phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging strategy, two key evolutionary traits living systems harness to optimize fitness in dynamic environments, have been widely reported yet how interplays therein could mediate fitness landscapes of heterogeneous populations remain unknown. Leveraging the financial asset pricing model, here we provide a dynamical framework for fitness of heterogeneous populations, underpinned by the interrelations between sub-populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedgeding. Our framework, independent of the definition of fitness, employs a nonlinear difference equation to present fitness dynamics, and capture the emergence of tipping points, marking the onset of critical state transitions which lead to catastrophic shifts. This study identifies limits on the selective advantage conferred by bet-hedging through reduction in the temporal variance of fitness, with far-reaching ramifications on our current understanding of hedging-mediated fitness enhancement of a population. The lower bound of the effective fitness variance is set by a maximum number of bet-hedgers, beyond which the fitness landscape approaches critical transition, as confirmed by critical slowing down in the vicinity of tipping points. We estimate the scaling law for the critical slowing down numerically and derive the characteristic recovery time for heterogeneous populations. Taken together, our work provides a generic theoretical framework to quantify fitness dynamics and predict critical transitions in heterogeneous populations. The results can be extended further to model fitness landscapes of natural and synthetic multi-species consortia exposed to environmental fluctuations mimicking climatic shifts and immunopathological settings.</description>

      <title>Evolution with Opponent-Learning Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are usually constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. In this paper, we study how large heterogeneous populations of learning agents evolve in normal-form games. We show how, under assumptions commonly made in the multi-armed bandit literature, Multi-Agent Policy Gradient closely resembles the Replicator Dynamic, and we further derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Opponent-Learning Awareness tailored for evolutionary simulations. This enables us to simulate the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. We demonstrate our approach in simulations of 200,000 agents, evolving in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game highlights distinct ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects evolution.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary game theory approach to modeling behavioral interaction in disclosing infection begins with an outbreak: COVID-19 as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of people worldwide prompted the implementation of a range of preventive measures at local, national, and international levels. Early in the outbreak, before the vaccine became accessible, voluntary quarantine and social isolation emerged as crucial strategies to curb the spread of infection. In this research, we present a game-theoretic model to elucidate the voluntary disclosure of exposure to infected individuals within communities. By employing a fractional derivative approach to illustrate disease propagation within the compartmental model, we determine the minimum level of voluntary disclosure required to disrupt the chain of transmission and allow the epidemic to fade. Our findings suggest that higher transmission rates and increased perceived severity of infection change the externality of disclosing infected exposure, thereby contributing to a rise in the proportion of individuals opting for quarantine and reducing disease incidence. We estimate behavioral parameters and transmission rates by fitting the model to hospitalized cases in Chile, South America. Results from our paper underscore the potential for public health authorities to influence and regulate voluntary disclosure of infection during emerging outbreaks through effective risk communication, emphasizing the severity of the disease, and providing accurate information about hospital capacity to the public.</description>

      <title>Topological conditions drive stability in meta-ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a global level, ecological communities are being perturbed at an unprecedented rate by human activities and environmental instabilities. Yet, we understand little about what factors facilitate or impede long-term persistence of these communities. While observational studies indicate that increased biodiversity must, somehow, be driving stability, theoretical studies have argued the exact opposite viewpoint instead. This encouraged many researchers to participate in the ongoing diversity-stability debate. Within this context, however, there has been a severe lack of studies that consider spatial features explicitly, even though nearly all habitats are spatially embedded. To this end, we study here the linear stability of meta-ecosystems on networks that describe how discrete patches are connected by dispersal between them. By combining results from random-matrix theory and network theory, we are able to show that there are three distinct features that underlie stability: edge density, tendency to triadic closure, and isolation or fragmentation. Our results appear to further indicate that network sparsity does not necessarily reduce stability, and that connections between patches are just as, if not more, important to consider when studying the stability of large ecological systems.</description>
