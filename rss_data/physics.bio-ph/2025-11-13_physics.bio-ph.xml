      <title>Abiogenesis on Different Star Types; a Dissipative Photochemical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life asserts a thermodynamic imperative for the origin of life, suggesting that the fundamental molecules of life originated as self-organized molecular photon dissipative structures (chromophores or pigments) that proliferated over the ocean surface to absorb and dissipate into heat the Archean solar soft UV-C (205-285 nm) and UV-B light ($&lt;$320 nm) of our G-type star. Shorter wavelength hard UV-C light ($&lt;$205 nm) may, depending on atmospheric conditions, have reached Earth's surface and ionized and dissociated or otherwise degraded these carbon-based pigment molecules (as probably occurred on Mars after losing most of its atmosphere). Here we assess the possibility for an abiogenesis of life similar to ours through molecular photon dissipative structuring on planets similar to early Earth but orbiting different star types at distances normalized to the solar constant. Emission spectra of star types are analyzed to determine the ratio of integrated photon fluxes in the soft UV-C wavelength (dissipative structuring) to hard UV-C wavelength (degradation) regions. Our analysis suggests that star types favorable to the dissipative structuring of life, potentially evolving towards complex life forms such as bacteria, are only the F, G and high mass K-types, with intelligent life only possible on G-type stars. Low mass K and M-type stars are highly unlikely to harbor life. Biosignatures related to the thermodynamic imperative of photon dissipation are proposed.</description>

      <title>Simulating Mono-and Multi-Protein Phosphorylation within Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein nanoclustering is a characteristic feature of their activated state and is essential for forming numerous subcellular structures. The formation of these nanoclusters is highly dependent on a series of post-translational modifications, such as mono-and multi-phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of residues. We theoretically simulate how a protein can be either mono-or multi-phosphorylated on several residues in functional nanoclusters, depending on effective biophysical parameters (diffusion, dwell time, etc.). Moving beyond a binary view of phosphorylation, this approach highlights the interplay between mono-and multi-phosphorylation, the cooperative effects generally associated with multi-phosphorylation networks, and stresses the role of phosphatases in transforming graded phosphorylation signals into almost switch-like responses. The results are discussed in light of experiments that probe the distribution of phospho-residues.</description>

      <title>Characterizing sleep stages through the complexity-entropy plane in human intracranial data and in a whole-brain model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the brain dynamics during different cortical states can reveal valuable information about its patterns across various cognitive processes. In particular, studying the differences between awake and sleep stages can shed light on the understanding of brain processes essential for physical and mental well-being, such as memory consolidation, information processing, and fatigue recovery. Alterations in these patterns may indicate disorders and pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here, we analyze time series obtained from intracranial recordings of 106 patients, covering four sleep stages: Wake, N2, N3, and REM. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which can include electrocorticography (ECoG) and depth recordings, represents the state-of-the-art measurements of brain activity, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neural dynamics. We characterize the signals using Bandt and Pompe symbolic methodology to calculate the Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and the Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) based on the Jensen and Shannon disequilibrium. By mapping the data onto the complexity-entropy plane, we observe that each stage occupies a distinct region, revealing its own dynamic signature. We show that our empirical results can be reproduced by a whole-brain computational model, in which each cortical region is described by a mean-field formulation based on networks of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons, adjusting the adaptation parameter to simulate the different sleep stages. Finally, we show that a classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cortical states.</description>

      <title>Broadband Dielectric and THz Spectroscopy on Bio-Related Matter: Water, Amino Acids, Proteins, and Blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine the relevance and proper interpretation of broadband-dielectric and THz-spectroscopy data for the investigation of various types of biological matter. We provide an overview of the rich variety of different dynamic processes that can be detected by these experimental methods. Several experimental examples are discussed in detail, helping to understand the information that can be drawn from such studies. This includes dielectric spectra, extending well into the GHz region, for pure water, which can be considered as a simple but highly important biological molecule. We also discuss results for a prototypical aqueous solution of a protein, belonging to one of the most important classes of biological macromolecules. Moreover, we examine broadband dielectric spectra on blood as an example of functional biological matter in organisms. To demonstrate the relevance of THz spectroscopy for the investigation of biological molecules, we finally treat such experiments applied to different amino acids.</description>

      <title>Active bacterial pattern formation in evaporating droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria living on surfaces are often confined to droplets. When these droplets evaporate, the motion of the liquid-air interface and the associated internal capillary flow confine the bacteria. Here we study how \emph{E. coli} bacteria interact with this capillary confinement and agglomerate at the droplet's contact line. We identify three different types of bacterial pattern formation that depend on the bacterial activity and the environmental conditions imposed by the evaporating droplet. When the evaporation is fast, the bacteria are slow or the suspension is dilute, a uniform contact-line deposit forms. However, when the capillary confinement concentrates the bacteria at the contact line beyond a critical number density, localized collective motion spontaneously emerges. In that case, the bacteria induce a local stirring of the liquid that allows them to self-organize into periodic patterns and enables them to collectively escape from the contact line. At very high number densities, these periodic patterns get destabilized by bacterial turbulence in the bulk of the droplet resulting in the formation of mobile bacterial plumes at the contact line. Our results show how the subtle interplay between the bacteria and the capillary flow inside the droplet that surrounds them governs their dispersal.</description>

      <title>Depth-enhanced molecular imaging with two-photon oblique plane microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\sim\!300$ nm lateral and $\sim\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $&gt;\!5\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\sim\!2\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $&gt;\!2\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.</description>

      <title>SynLlama: Generating Synthesizable Molecules and Their Analogs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12602v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models for exploring chemical space have shown immense promise, but many molecules they generate are too difficult to synthesize, making them impractical for further investigation or development. In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data, and offers strong performance in both forward and bottom-up synthesis planning compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for discovery.</description>
