      <title>The Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Ladder and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) has been used as a distance indicator since the early 1990's, its application to measure the Hubble Constant as a primary distance indicator occurred only recently. The TRGB is also currently at an interesting crossroads as results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are beginning to emerge. In this chapter, we provide a review of the TRGB as it is used to measure the Hubble constant. First, we provide an essential review of the physical and observational basis of the TRGB as well as providing a summary for its use for measuring the Hubble Constant. More attention is then given is then given to recent, but still pre-JWST, developments, including new calibrations and developments with algorithms. We also address challenges that arise while measuring a TRGB-based Hubble Constant. We close by looking forward to the exciting prospects from telescopes such as JWST and Gaia.</description>

      <title>The imprints of galaxy cluster internal dynamics on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming measurements of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect in galaxy clusters will dramatically improve our understanding of the main intra-cluster medium (ICM) properties and how they depend on the particular thermal and dynamical state of the associated clusters. Using a sample of simulated galaxy clusters we assess the impact of the ICM internal dynamics on both the thermal and kinetic SZ effects (tSZ and kSZ, respectively). We produce synthetic maps of the SZ effect, for the simulated clusters. For each galaxy cluster in the sample, its dynamical state is estimated by using a combination of well-established indicators. We use the correlations between SZ maps and cluster dynamical state, to look for the imprints of the evolutionary events, mainly mergers, on the SZ signals. The kinetic effect shows a remarkable correlation with the dynamical state: unrelaxed clusters present a higher radial profile and an overall stronger signal at all masses and radii. Furthermore, the kSZ signal is correlated with rotation for relaxed clusters, while for the disturbed systems the effect is dominated by other motions such as bulk flows, turbulence, etc. The kSZ effect shows a dipolar pattern when averaging over cluster dynamical classes, especially for the relaxed population. This feature can be exploited to stack multiple kSZ maps in order to recover a stronger dipole signal that would be correlated with the global rotation properties of the sample. The SZ effect can be used as a tool to estimate the dynamical state of galaxy clusters, especially to segregate those clusters with a quiescent evolution from those with a rich record of recent merger events. Our results suggest that the forthcoming observational data measuring the SZ signal in clusters could be used as a complementary strategy to classify the evolutionary history of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Galaxy spin direction asymmetry in JWST deep fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented imaging power of JWST provides new abilities to observe the shapes of objects in the early Universe in a way that has not been possible before. Recently, JWST acquired a deep field image inside the same field imaged in the past as the HST Ultra Deep Field. Computer-based quantitative analysis of spiral galaxies in that field shows that among 34 galaxies for which their rotation of direction can be determined by the shapes of the arms, 24 rotate clockwise, and just 10 rotate counterclockwise. The one-tailed binomial distribution probability to have asymmetry equal or stronger than the observed asymmetry by chance is $\sim$0.012. While the analysis is limited by the small size of the data, the observed asymmetry is aligned with all relevant previous large-scale analyses from all premier digital sky surveys, all show a higher number of galaxies rotating clockwise in that part of the sky, and the magnitude of the asymmetry increases as the redshift gets higher. This paper also provides data and analysis to reproduce previous experiments suggesting that the distribution of galaxy rotation in the Universe is random, to show that the exact same data used in these studies in fact show non-random distribution, and in excellent agreement with the results shown here. These findings reinforce consideration of the possibility that the directions of rotation of spiral galaxies as observed from Earth are not necessarily randomly distributed. The explanation can be related to the large-scale structure of the Universe, but can also be related to a possible anomaly in the physics of galaxy rotation.</description>

      <title>Maximum A Posteriori Ly-alpha Estimator (MAPLE): Band-power and covariance estimation of the 3D Ly-alpha forest power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel maximum a posteriori estimator to jointly estimate band-powers and the covariance of the three-dimensional power spectrum (P3D) of Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations, called MAPLE. Our Wiener-filter based algorithm reconstructs a window-deconvolved P3D in the presence of complex survey geometries typical for Lyman-alpha surveys that are sparsely sampled transverse to and densely sampled along the line-of-sight. We demonstrate our method on idealized Gaussian random fields with two selection functions: (i) a sparse sampling of 30 background sources per square degree designed to emulate the currently observing the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI); (ii) a dense sampling of 900 background sources per square degree emulating the upcoming Prime Focus Spectrograph Galaxy Evolution Survey. Our proof-of-principle shows promise, especially since the algorithm can be extended to marginalize jointly over nuisance parameters and contaminants, i.e.offsets introduced by continuum fitting. Our code is implemented in JAX and is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Full Resolution of the 450 {\mu}m Extragalactic Background Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extragalactic background light (EBL) is the cumulative radiation outside the Milky Way. The determination of its corresponding primary emitting sources as well as its total energy level across the entire electromagnetic spectrum has profound implications for both cosmology and galaxy formation. However, the detailed origin of the EBL at far-infrared wavelengths, particularly those close to the peak of the cosmic infrared background, remains unclear. Here we report the results of our ongoing SCUBA-2 450 $\mu$m survey of 10 massive galaxy cluster fields. By exploiting the strong gravitational lensing offered by these clusters, we obtain significant counts down to an unprecedented depth of $\sim$0.1 mJy at this wavelength, about ten times deeper than that reached by any other previous survey. The cumulative energy density based on the counts is 138.1$^{+23.9}_{-19.3}$ Jy degree$^{-2}$, or 0.45$^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ MJy sr$^{-1}$. Comparing our measurements to those made by the COBE and Planck satellites, we find that at this flux density level, the 450 $\mu$m EBL is entirely resolved by our SCUBA-2 observations. Thus, we find for the first time that discrete sources produce fully to the 450 $\mu$m EBL, and that about half of it comes from sources with sub-mJy flux densities. Our deep number counts provide strong constraints on galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Constraining Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Large Scale Structure with the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as a tool for the study of Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in Large Scale Structure (LSS), and compare its performance with that achievable via a joint analysis with power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We consider the three main primordial bispectrum shapes - local, equilateral and orthogonal - and produce Fisher forecast for the corresponding fNL amplitude parameters, jointly with standard cosmological parameters. We analyze simulations from the publicly available "Quijote" and "Quijote-png" N-body suites, studying both the dark matter and halo fields. We find that the WST outperforms the power spectrum alone on all parameters, both on the fNL's and on cosmological ones. In particular, on fNL_loc for halos, the improvement is about 27%. When B is combined with P, halo constraints from WST are weaker for fNL_loc (at ~ 15% level), but stronger for fNL_eq (~ 25%) and fNL_ortho (~ 28%). Our results show that WST, both alone and in combination with P+B, can improve the extraction of information on PNG from LSS data over the one attainable by a standard P+B analysis. Moreover, we identify a class of WST in which the origin of the extra information on PNG can be cleanly isolated.</description>

      <title>The low multipoles in the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.</description>

      <title>Searching for large dark matter clumps using the Galileo Satnav clock variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants, with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space. The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event. Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$ kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient effects, has never been explored previously.</description>

      <title>Testing the $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM Cosmological Model with Forthcoming Measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background with SPT-3G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and 12 $\mu{\rm K-arcmin}$, respectively, in CMB temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ~1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level ~$\sqrt{\text{2}}$ times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential bandpowers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization bandpowers. We demonstrate the ability to test the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ~2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Analytical perturbations of relativistic images in Kerr space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10169v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light rays passing very close to black holes may wind several times before escaping. For any given electromagnetic source around the black hole, a distant observer would thus observe two infinite sequences of images on either side of the black hole. These images are generated by light rays performing an increasing numbers of loops. The strong deflection limit provides a simple analytic formalism to describe such higher order images for spherically symmetric metrics, while for axially symmetric black holes one typically resorts to numerical approaches. Here we present the leading order perturbation to higher order images when the black hole spin is turned on. We show that the images slide around the black hole shadow as an effect of space-time dragging. We derive analytical formulae for their shifts and the perturbation of their time delays. We also discuss how such simple analytical formulae for images by Kerr black holes can be of great help in many applications.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Baryons on Low-mass Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) project used dark-matter-only simulations to study the abundance and structure of dark matter haloes over the full mass range populated in the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology. Here we explore how baryonic effects modify these results for $z=0$ halo masses in the range $10^4$ to $10^7~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, below the threshold for galaxy formation. Our main study focuses on three simulations from identical initial conditions at $z=127$, one following dark matter only, one including non-radiative gas, and one additionally including the baryonic physics relevant in this halo mass range (cooling and photoheating). In the non-radiative simulation, above $10^{5.5}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, halo abundance and internal structure are very similar to the dark-matter-only simulation, and the baryon to dark matter ratio is everywhere close to the cosmic value. At lower mass, this ratio drops and haloes are less concentrated and less massive in the non-radiative case. Test simulations at higher resolution show this to be mainly a resolution effect; the expected drop in baryon content due to residual pressure effects only becomes substantial for $z=0$ haloes below $\sim 10^{2.7}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, gas is heated by reionization at $z=6$ in our ``full physics'' run, and this results in almost complete expulsion of gas from all haloes in our simulated mass range. This suppresses the halo mass function by $\sim 30 \%$, lowers halo concentration, and consequently weakens the dark matter annihilation signal by $\sim 40-60 \%$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups as the ultimate probe of AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The co-evolution between supermassive black holes and their environment is most directly traced by the hot atmospheres of dark matter halos. Cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting active galactic nuclei (AGN) with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling. Every major modern hydrodynamical simulation suite now includes a prescription for AGN feedback to reproduce realistic populations of galaxies. However, the mechanisms governing the feeding/feedback cycle between the central black holes and their surrounding galaxies and halos are still poorly understood. Galaxy groups are uniquely suited to constrain the mechanisms governing the cooling-heating balance, as the energy supplied by the central AGN can exceed the gravitational binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we provide a brief overview of our knowledge of the impact of AGN on the hot atmospheres of galaxy groups, with a specific focus on the thermodynamic profiles of groups. We then present our on-going efforts to improve on the implementation of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution models by providing precise benchmarks on the properties of galaxy groups. We introduce the \XMM~ Group AGN Project (X-GAP), a large program on \XMM~ targeting a sample of 49 galaxy groups out to $R_{500c}$.</description>

      <title>The Mass Density of Merging Binary Black Holes Over Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and their stellar progenitors remains uncertain. Specifically, the fraction $\epsilon$ of stellar mass that ends up in BBH mergers and the delay time $\tau$ between star formation and BBH merger carry information about the astrophysical processes that give rise to merging BBHs. We model the BBH merger rate in terms of the cosmic star formation history, coupled with a metallicity-dependent efficiency $\epsilon$ and a distribution of delay times $\tau$, and infer these parameters with data from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We find that the progenitors to merging BBHs preferentially form in low metallicity environments with a low metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{&lt;Z_t}=-3.99^{+0.68}_{-0.87}$ and a high metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{&lt;Z_t}=-4.60^{+0.30}_{-0.34}$ at the 90% credible level. The data also prefer short delay times. For a power-law distribution $p(\tau)\propto \tau^\alpha$, we find $\tau_\text{min}&lt;1.9 $ Gyr and $\alpha&lt;-1.32$ at 90% credibility. Our model allows us to extrapolate the mass density in BBHs out to high redshifts. We cumulatively integrate our modelled density rate over cosmic time to get the total mass density of merging stellar mass BBHs as a function of redshift. Today, stellar-mass BBH mergers make up only $\sim 0.01\%$ of the total stellar mass density created by high-mass ($&gt;10\,M_\odot$) progenitors. However, because massive stars are so short-lived, there may be more mass in merging BBHs than in living massive stars as early as $\sim 2.5$ Gyr ago. We also compare to the mass in supermassive BHs, finding that the mass densities were comparable $\sim 12.5$ Gyr ago, but the mass density in SMBHs quickly increased to $\sim 75$ times the mass density in merging stellar mass BBHs by $z\sim 1$.</description>

      <title>Teaming-up radio and submm-FIR observations to probe dusty star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the benefits of teaming up data from the radio to the far- 1 infrared (FIR) regime for the characterization of Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs). These galaxies 2 are thought to be the star-forming progenitors of local massive quiescent galaxies, and play a pivotal 3 role in the reconstruction of the cosmic star formation rate density up to high redshift. Due to their 4 dust-enshrouded nature, DSFGs are often invisible in the near-infrared/Optical/UV bands. Therefore, 5 they necessitate observations at longer wavelengths, primarily the FIR, where dust emission occurs, 6 and radio, which is not affected by dust absorption. Combining data from these two spectral windows 7 makes it possible to characterize even the dustiest objects, enabling the retrieval of information about 8 their age, dust temperature, and star-formation status, and facilitates the differentiation between 9 various galaxy populations that evolve throughout cosmic history. Despite the detection of faint radio 10 sources being a challenging task, this study demonstrates that an effective strategy to build statistically 11 relevant samples of DSFGs would be reaching deep sensitivities in the radio band, even restricted to 12 smaller areas, and then combining these radio observations with FIR/submm data. Additionally, 13 the paper quantifies the improvement in the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) reconstruction of 14 DSFGs by incorporating ALMA band measurements, in particular, in its upgraded status thanks to 15 the anticipated Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late $80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$ dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum decay and symmetry breaking play an important role in the fundamental structure of the matter and the evolution of the universe. In this work we study how the purely classical effect of accretion of fundamental fields onto black holes can lead to shells of symmetry restoration in the midst of a symmetry broken phase. We also show how it can catalyze vacuum decay, forming a bubble that expands asymptotically at the speed of light. These effects offer an alternative, purely classical mechanism to quantum tunnelling for seeding phase transitions in the universe.</description>

      <title>Double polytropic cosmic acceleration from the Murnaghan equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a double polytropic cosmological fluid and demonstrate that, when one constituent resembles a bare cosmological constant while the other emulates a generalized Chaplygin gas, a good description of the Universe's large-scale dynamics is obtained. In particular, our double polytropic reduces to the Murnaghan equation of state, whose applications are already well established in solid state physics and classical thermodynamics. Intriguingly, our model approximates the conventional $\Lambda$CDM paradigm while reproducing the collective effects of logotropic and generalized Chaplygin fluids across different regimes. To check the goodness of our fluid description, we analyze first order density perturbations, refining our model through various orders of approximation, utilizing $\sigma_8$ data alongside other cosmological data sets. Encouraging results suggest that our model, based on the Murnaghan equation of state, outperforms the standard cosmological background within specific approximate regimes and, on the whole, surpasses the standard phenomenological reconstruction of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Quasar Island - Three new $z\sim6$ quasars, including a lensed candidate, identified with contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Of the hundreds of $z\gtrsim6$ quasars discovered to date, only one is known to be gravitationally lensed, despite the high lensing optical depth expected at $z\gtrsim6$. High-redshift quasars are typically identified in large-scale surveys by applying strict photometric selection criteria, in particular by imposing non-detections in bands blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. Such procedures by design prohibit the discovery of lensed quasars, as the lensing foreground galaxy would contaminate the photometry of the quasar. We present a novel quasar selection methodology, applying contrastive learning (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to Dark Energy Survey imaging data. We describe the use of this technique to train a neural network which isolates an 'island' of 11 sources, of which 7 are known $z\sim6$ quasars. Of the remaining four, three are newly discovered quasars (J0109-5424, $z=6.07$; J0122-4609, $z=5.99$; J0603-3923, $z=5.94$), as confirmed by follow-up Gemini-South/GMOS and archival NTT/EFOSC2 spectroscopy, implying a 91 per cent efficiency for our novel selection method; the final object on the island is a brown dwarf. In one case (J0109-5424), emission below the Lyman limit unambiguously indicates the presence of a foreground source, though high-resolution optical/near-infrared imaging is still needed to confirm the quasar's lensed (multiply-imaged) nature. Detection in the g band has led this quasar to escape selection by traditional colour cuts. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning techniques can thus play a key role in unveiling populations of quasars missed by traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Constraints on peculiar velocity distribution of binary black holes using gravitational waves with GWTC-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peculiar velocity encodes rich information about the formation, dynamics, evolution, and merging history of binary black holes. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer the peculiar velocity distribution of binary black holes. We use the data from GWTC-3 and assume a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the peculiar velocities, but do not consider the dependence of peculiar velocity on the masses of black hole binaries. The constraint on the peculiar velocity distribution parameter, $v_0$, is weak and uninformative. However, the determination of peculiar velocity distribution can be significantly improved with next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors. For the Einstein Telescope, the relative uncertainty of $v_0$ will reduce to $\sim$ 10\% using $10^3$ golden binary black hole events. Our statistical approach thus provides a robust and prospective inference for determining the peculiar velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of MOND and MOG theories versus the$\kappa$-model: An application to galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many models have been proposed to minimize the dark matter (DM) content in various astronomical objects at every scale in the Universe. The most widely known model isMOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). MOND was first published by Mordehai Milgromin 1983 (Milgrom, 1983; 2015; see also Banik and Zhao, 2022 for a review). A second concurrent model is modified gravity (MOG), which is a covariant scalar-tensor-vector (STVG)extension of general relativity (Moffat, 2006; 2020). Other theories also exist but have notbeen broadly applied to a large list of astronomical objects (Mannheim and Kazanas, 1989;Capozziello and De Laurentis, 2012; O'Brien and Moss, 2015; Verlinde, 2017). A new model,called $\kappa$-model, based on very elementary phenomenological considerations, has recently beenproposed in the astrophysics field. This model shows that the presence of dark matter canbe considerably minimized with regard to the dynamics of galaxies (Pascoli, 2022 a,b). The$\kappa$-model belongs to the general family of theories descended from MOND. Under this familyof theories, there is no need to develop a highly uncertain dark matter sector of physics toexplain the observations.</description>

      <title>KiDS-1000 cosmology: Combined second- and third-order shear statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper performs the first cosmological parameter analysis of the KiDS-1000 data with second- and third-order shear statistics. This work builds on a series of papers that describe the roadmap to third-order shear statistics. We derive and test a combined model of the second-order shear statistic, namely the COSEBIs and the third-order aperture mass statistics $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$ in a tomographic set-up. We validate our pipeline with $N$-body simulations that mock the fourth Kilo Degree survey data release. To model the second- and third-order statistics, we use the latest version of \textsc{HMcode2020} for the power spectrum and \textsc{BiHalofit} for the bispectrum. Furthermore, we use an analytic description to model intrinsic alignments and hydro-dynamical simulations to model the effect of baryonic feedback processes. Lastly, we decreased the dimension of the data vector significantly by considering for the $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$ part of the data vector only equal smoothing radii, making a data analysis of the fourth Kilo Degree survey data release using a combined analysis of COSEBIs third-order shear statistic possible. We first validate the accuracy of our modelling by analysing a noise-free mock data vector assuming the KiDS-1000 error budget, finding a shift in the maximum-a-posterior of the matter density parameter $\Delta \Omega_m&lt; 0.02\, \sigma_{\Omega_m}$ and of the structure growth parameter $\Delta S_8 &lt; 0.05\, \sigma_{S_8}$. Lastly, we performed the first KiDS-1000 cosmological analysis using a combined analysis of second- and third-order shear statistics, where we constrained $\Omega_m=0.248^{+0.062}_{-0.055}$ and $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.772\pm0.022$. The geometric average on the errors of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $S_8$ of the combined statistics increased compared to the second-order statistic by 2.2.</description>

      <title>Cosmological parameters estimated from velocity -- density comparisons: Calibrating 2M++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological parameters can be measured by comparing peculiar velocities with those predicted from a galaxy density field. Previous work has tested the accuracy of this approach with N-body simulations, but generally on idealised mock galaxy surveys. However, systematic biases may arise solely due to survey selection effects such as flux-limited samples, edge-effects, and complications due to the obscuration of the Galactic plane. In this work, we explore the impact of each of these effects individually well as collectively, using the semi-analytic models from numerical simulations to generate mock catalogues that mimic the 2M++ density field. We find the reconstruction and analysis methods used for our 2M++ mocks produce a value of fsigma_8 that is biased high by a factor 1.04 \pm 0.01 compared to the true value. Moreover, a cosmic volume matching that of 2M++ has a cosmic variance uncertainty in fsigma_8 of ~5%. The systematic bias is a function of distance: it is unbiased close to the origin but is biased slightly high for distances in the range 100-180 Mpc/h. Correcting for this small bias, we find the linear fsigma_8 = 0.362 \pm 0.023. The predicted peculiar velocities from 2M++ have an error of 170 km/s that slowly increases with distance, exceeding 200 km/s only at distances of 180-200 Mpc/h. Finally, the residual bulk flow speeds found in previous work are shown to be not in conflict with those expected in the Lambda cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spin Transition Driven by the Misalignments between the Protogalaxy Inertia and Initial Tidal Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical detection of the $\tau$-driven transition of galaxy spins is presented, where $\tau$ is the degree of misalignment between the initial tidal field and protogalaxy inertia tensors. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we first measure the values of $\tau$ at the protogalactic sites found by tracing the constituents of the galactic halos in the mass range of $10.5\le \log \left[M_{h}/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})\right] \le 13$ back to the initial stage, $z_{i}=127$. The probability density functions of $\tau$ are shown to be well modeled by the $\Gamma$-distributions, whose shape and scale parameters turn out to have universal values on a certain critical scale. Then, we investigate how the strength and tendency of the galaxy spin alignments with the principal axes of the local tidal fields depend on the initial condition, $\tau$. It is found that on the scale lower than the critical one, the galaxy spin transition occurs at two different thresholds from the major to intermediate and from the intermediate to minor principal axes of the local tidal fields, respectively. Noting that the $\tau$-dependent spin transition supersedes in strength the previously found mass-dependent, morphology-dependent, and radius-dependent counterparts, we suggest that $\tau$ should be the key driver of all types of the galaxy spin transition and that the present galaxy spins are indeed excellent fossil records of the initial condition.</description>

      <title>A generalized mass-to-horizon relation: a new global approach to entropic cosmologies and its connection to $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a new generalized mass-to-horizon relation to be used in the context of entropic cosmologies and holographic principle scenarios. We show that a general scaling of the mass with the Universe horizon as $M=\gamma \frac{c^2}{G}L^n$ leads to a new generalized entropy $S_n = \gamma \frac{n}{1+n}\frac{2 \pi\,k_B\,c^3}{G\,\hbar} L^{n+1}$ from which we can recover many of the recently proposed forms of entropies at cosmological and black hole scales and also establish a thermodynamically consistent relation between each of them and Hawking temperature. We analyse the consequences of introducing this new mass-to-horizon relation on cosmological scales by comparing the corresponding modified Friedmann, acceleration, and continuity equations to cosmological data. We find that when $n=3$, the entropic cosmology model is fully and totally equivalent to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, thus providing a new fundamental support for the origin and the nature of the cosmological constant. In general, if $\log \gamma &lt; -3$, and irrespective of the value of $n$, we find a very good agreement with the data comparable with $\Lambda$CDM from which, in Bayesian terms, our models are indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Light Thermal Self-Interacting Dark Matter in the Shadow of Non-Standard Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a viable model for a GeV scale self-interacting dark matter (DM), where the DM was thermally produced in the early universe. Here, a new vector-like fermion with a dark charge under the $U(1)_{D}$ gauge symmetry serves as a secluded WIMP DM and it can dominantly annihilate into the light dark gauge boson and singlet scalar through the dark gauge interaction. Also, the self-interaction of DM is induced by the light dark gauge boson via the same gauge interaction. In addition to these particles, we further introduce two Weyl fermions and a doublet scalar, by which the dark gauge boson produced from s-wave DM annihilations can mostly decay into active neutrinos after the dark symmetry breaking such that the CMB bound on the DM with low masses can be eluded. In order to have a common parameter region to explain the observed relic abundance and self-interaction of DM, we also study this model in a non-standard cosmological evolution, where the cosmic expansion driven by a new field species is faster than the standard radiation-dominated universe during the frozen time of DM. Reversely, one can also use the self-interacting nature of light thermal DM to examine the non-standard cosmological history of the universe.</description>

      <title>The Cosmology of Dark Energy Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the cosmological signatures of dark energy radiation -- a novel description of dark energy, which proposes that the dynamical component of dark energy is comprised of a thermal bath of relativistic particles sourced by thermal friction from a slowly rolling scalar field. For a minimal model with particle production emerging from first principles, we find that the abundance of radiation sourced by dark energy can be as large as $\Omega_{\text{DER}} = 0.03$, exceeding the bounds on relic dark radiation by three orders of magnitude. Although the background and perturbative evolution of dark energy radiation is distinct from Quintessence, we find that current and near-future cosmic microwave background and supernova data will not distinguish these models of dark energy. We also find that our constraints on all models are dominated by their impact on the expansion rate of the Universe. Considering extensions that allow the dark radiation to populate neutrinos, axions, and dark photons, we evaluate the direct detection prospects of a thermal background comprised of these candidates consistent with cosmological constraints on dark energy radiation. Our study indicates that a resolution of $\sim 6 \, \text{meV}$ is required to achieve sensitivity to relativistic neutrinos compatible with dark energy radiation in a neutrino capture experiment on tritium. We also find that dark matter axion experiments lack sensitivity to a relativistic thermal axion background, even if enhanced by dark energy radiation, and dedicated search strategies are required to probe new parameter space. We derive constraints arising from a dark photon background from oscillations into visible photons, and find that viable parameter space can be explored with the LAte Dark Energy RAdiation (LADERA) experiment.</description>

Abstract: Extrapolating the Standard Model Higgs potential at high energies, we study the barrier between the electroweak and Planck scale minima. The barrier arises by taking the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses. We then extend the Standard Model by including a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and explore the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model. We point out that even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier; we find that the required value of the non-minimal coupling is smaller than the one needed for the conventional Higgs inflation scenario (which relies on a stable Standard Model Higgs potential, without any barrier); in addition, values of the top mass which are slightly larger than those required in the conventional scenario are allowed.</description>
