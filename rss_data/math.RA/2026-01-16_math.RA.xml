      <title>On the Canonical Construction of Simple Lie Superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axioms for the generalization of root systems were defined and classified (irreducible) by V. Serganova, which precisely correspond to the root systems of basic classical Lie Superalgebras. Here, we present a unified method for constructing simple Lie Superalgebras from the abstract root system, with the choice of base having the minimal number of isotropic roots.</description>

      <title>Malcev classification for the variety of left-symmetric algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study three classes of subvarieties inside the variety of left-symmetric algebras. We show that these subvarieties are naturally related to some well-known varieties, such as alternative, assosymmetric and Zinbiel algebras. For certain subvarieties of the varieties of alternative and assosymmetric algebras, we explicitly construct bases of the corresponding free algebras. We then define the commutator and anti-commutator operations on these algebras and derive a number of identities satisfied by these operations in all degrees up to $4$.</description>

      <title>Real characters and real classes of $\mathrm{GL}_2$ and $\mathrm{GU}_2$ over discrete valuation rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{o}$ be the ring of integers of a non-archimedean local field with residue field of odd characteristic, $\mathfrak{p}$ be its maximal ideal and let $\mathfrak{o}_\ell = \mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^\ell$ for $\ell\ge 2$. In this article, we study real-valued characters and real representations of the finite groups $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$ and $\mathrm{GU}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$. We give a complete classification of real and strongly real classes of these groups and characterize the real-valued irreducible complex characters. We prove that every real-valued irreducible complex character of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$ is afforded by a representation over $\mathbb{R}$. In contrast, we show that $\mathrm{GU}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$ admits real-valued irreducible characters that are not realizable over $\mathbb{R}$. These results extend the parallel known phenomena for the finite groups $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $\mathrm{GU}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dimensional Mathematics: A Foundation For STP/STA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12920v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new mathematical structure, called the cross-dimensional mathematics (CDM), is proposed. The CDM considered in this paper consists of three parts: hyper algebra, hyper geometry, and hyper Lie group/Lie algebra. Hyper algebra proposes some new algebraic structures such as hyper group, hyper ring, and hyper module over matrices and vectors with mixed dimensions (MVMDs). They have sets of classical groups, rings, and modules as their components and cross-dimensional connections among their components. Their basic properties are investigated. Hyper geometry starts from mixed dimensional Euclidian space, and hyper vector space. Then the hyper topological vector space, hyper inner product space, and hyper manifold are constructed. They have a joined cross-dimensional geometric structure. Finally, hyper metric space, topological hyper group and hyper Lie algebra are built gradually, and finally, the corresponding hyper Lie group is introduced. All these concepts are built over MVMDs, and to reach our purpose in addition to existing semi-tensor products (STPs) and semi-tensor additions (STAs), a couple of most general STP and STA are introduced. Some existing structures/results about STPs/STAs have also been resumed and integrated into this CDM.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Spectral Graph Theory: Harmonic Analysis on Directed Networks via Biorthogonal Bases (Random-Walk Laplacian Formulation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operator-theoretic dichotomy underlying diffusion on directed networks is \emph{symmetry versus non-self-adjointness} of the Markov transition operator. In the reversible (detailed-balance) regime, a directed random walk $P$ is self-adjoint in a stationary $\pi$-weighted inner product and admits orthogonal spectral coordinates; outside reversibility, $P$ is genuinely non-self-adjoint (often non-normal), and stability is governed by biorthogonal geometry and eigenvector conditioning. In this paper we develop a harmonic-analysis framework for directed graphs anchored on the random-walk transition matrix $P=D_{\mathrm{out}}^{-1}A$ and the random-walk Laplacian $L_{\mathrm{rw}}=I-P$. Using biorthogonal left/right eigenvectors we define a \emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) adapted to directed diffusion, propose a diffusion-consistent frequency ordering based on decay rates $\Re(1-\lambda)$, and derive operator-norm stability bounds for iterated diffusion and for BGFT spectral filters. We prove sampling and reconstruction theorems for $P$-bandlimited (equivalently $L_{\mathrm{rw}}$-bandlimited) signals and quantify noise amplification through the conditioning of the biorthogonal eigenbasis. A simulation protocol on directed cycles and perturbed non-normal digraphs demonstrates that asymmetry alone does not dictate instability; rather, non-normality and eigenvector ill-conditioning drive reconstruction sensitivity, making BGFT a natural analytical language for directed diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Geometry of Ternary Gamma Schemes:Sheaf-Theoretic Foundations and Laplacian Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops a self-contained affine $\Gamma$-scheme theory for a class of commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings. By establishing all geometric and spectral results internally, the work provides a unified framework for triadic symmetry and spectral analysis. The central thesis is that a triadic $\Gamma$-algebra canonically induces two primary structures: (i) an intrinsic triadic symmetry in the sense of a Nambu--Filippov-type fundamental identity on the structure sheaf, and (ii) a canonical Laplacian on the finite $\Gamma$-spectrum whose spectral decomposition detects the clopen (connected-component) decomposition of the underlying space. We define $\Gamma$-ideals and prime $\Gamma$-ideals, endow $\SpecG(T)$ with a $\Gamma$-Zariski topology, construct localizations and the structure sheaf on the basis of principal opens, and prove the affine anti-equivalence between commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings and affine $\Gamma$-schemes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the triadic bracket on sections is invariant under $\Gamma$-automorphisms and compatible with localization. The main spectral theorem establishes the block-diagonalization of the Laplacian under topological decompositions and provides an algebraic-connectivity criterion. The theory is verified through explicit computations of finite $\Gamma$-spectra and their corresponding Laplacian spectra</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras from surfaces and symmetric quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras $\mathcal{A}$ associated with unpunctured surfaces $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$ endowed with an orientation-preserving involution $\sigma$. We give a geometric realization of such cluster algebras by showing that cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $\sigma$-orbits of arcs of $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$, while clusters are given by admissible $\sigma$-invariant triangulations. We establish a ring homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}$ to a skew-symmetric cluster algebra of the same rank, which is combinatorially derived from $\mathcal{A}$. We use this result to provide a cluster expansion formula for any $\sigma$-orbit $[\gamma]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[\gamma]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$, providing a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting.</description>
