      <title>Gravitational lensing in holonomy corrected spherically symmetric black holes with phantom global monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a theoretical investigation of the gravitational lensing phenomenon within the space-time framework of a holonomy-corrected spherically symmetric black hole (BH), incorporating both ordinary and phantom global monopoles. Our focus lies on the analysis of null geodesics within this black hole background, examining the influence of ordinary and phantom global monopoles on the effective potential of null geodesics of the system. Afterwards, we derive analytical expressions for the deflection angle of photon light, considering weak field limit. The obtain expressions are presented up to the second order of the Loop Quantum Gravity parameter, enabling a thorough examination of the impact of ordinary and phantom global monopoles on the deflection angle.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy in environments: detectability prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown phase following a binary black hole coalescence is a powerful tool for measuring properties of the remnant black hole. Future gravitational wave detectors will increase the precision of these measurements and may be sensitive to the environment surrounding the black hole. This work examines how environments affect the ringdown from a binary coalescence. Our analysis shows that for astrophysical parameters and sensitivity of planned detectors, the ringdown signal is indistinguishable from its vacuum counterpart, suggesting that ringdown-only analyses can reliably extract the (redshifted) mass and spin of the remnant black hole. These conclusions include models with spectral instabilities, suggesting that these are not relevant from an observational viewpoint. Deviations from inspiral-only estimates could then enhance the characterisation of environmental effects present during the coalescence.</description>

      <title>Constraining burdened PBHs with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of memory burden on the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum arising from the Hawking evaporation of light primordial black holes (PBHs). By considering both rotating (Kerr) and non-rotating (Schwarzschild) PBHs, we demonstrate that the overproduction of primordial GWs from burdened PBHs could impose stringent constraints on the parameters governing backreaction effects. These constraints, derived from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements by Planck and prospective experiments such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, offer novel insights into the impact of memory burden on PBH dynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing No slip model with pulsar timing arrays: NANOGrav and IPTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an observational study of modified gravity considering a potential inflationary interpretation of pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We use a motivated model known as no slip in which the gravitational wave propagation is modified. Specifically, by using two different parametrizations for the model, we find the approximate transfer functions for tensor perturbations. In this way, we obtain the spectral energy density of gravitational waves and use NANOGrav and IPTA second data release to constrain parameters of the model. We find that there is degeneracy between the model parameters $\xi$ and $c_M$. For $c_M$, we only get an upper bound on the parameter. Thus, it is difficult to constrain them with percent level accuracy with the current PTA data.</description>

      <title>Love symmetry in higher-dimensional rotating black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for constructing a 1-parameter family of globally-defined Love symmetry generators in rotating black hole spacetimes of general dimension. The key ingredient is to focus on the vicinity of the (physical) outer horizon, matching only the radial derivative and the outer horizon pole pieces of the Klein--Gordon operator in the black hole spacetime to the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Casimir operator. After revisiting the 4D Kerr and 5D Myers--Perry cases, the procedure is illustrated on generalized Lense--Thirring spacetimes which describe a wide variety of slowly rotating black hole metrics in any number of dimensions. Such spacetimes are known to admit an extended tower of Killing tensor and Killing vector symmetries and, as demonstrated in this paper, allow for separability of the massive scalar wave equation in Myers--Perry-like coordinates. Interestingly, separability also occurs in the horizon-penetrating Painlev{\'e}--Gullstrand coordinates associated with the freely infalling observer who registers flat space around her all the way to singularity.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Klein-Gordon system via Cauchy-characteristic evolution: Computation of memory and ringdown tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cauchy-characteristic evolution (CCE) is a powerful method for accurately extracting gravitational waves at future null infinity. In this work, we extend the previously implemented CCE system within the numerical relativity code SpECTRE by incorporating a scalar field. This allows the system to capture features of beyond-general-relativity theories. We derive scalar contributions to the equations of motion, Weyl scalar computations, Bianchi identities, and balance laws at future null infinity. Our algorithm, tested across various scenarios, accurately reveals memory effects induced by both scalar and tensor fields and captures Price's power-law tail ($u^{-l-2}$) in scalar fields at future null infinity, in contrast to the $t^{-2l-3}$ tail at future timelike infinity.</description>

      <title>Testing EGB gravity coupled to bumblebee field and black hole parameter estimation with EHT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general covariant Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity in Four-Dimensional (4D EGB) spacetime is shown to bypass Lovelock's theorem and is free from Ostrogradsky instability. Meanwhile, the bumblebee theory is a vector-tensor theory. It extends the Einstein--Maxwell theory that allows for the spontaneous symmetry breaking that leads to the field acquiring a vacuum expectation value, introducing Lorentz violation into the system. We investigate rotating black holes in the 4D EGB-bumblebee gravity model where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken -- Kerr EGB bumblebee (KEGBB) black holes. The latest observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) M87* and Sgr A* have sparked intensified interest in the study of black hole shadows, which present a novel avenue for investigating SMBHs within the strong-field regime. Motivated by this, we model SMBHs M87* and Sgr A* as KEGBB black holes, and using the EHT observation result, for given $l$, to find earlier upper limits on the $\alpha$ and $a$ are altered. The KEGBB and Kerr black holes are indiscernible in some parameter space, and one cannot rule out the possibility that the former may serve as strong candidates for astrophysical black holes. Employing our newly developed parameter estimation technique, we use two EHT observables -- namely, the angular diameter of the shadow, $d_{sh}$, and the axial ratio, $\mathcal{D}_A$ -- to estimate parameters of M87* and Sgr A* taking into account observational errors associated with the EHT results.</description>

      <title>Influence of scalar field in massive particle motion in JNW spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the motion of massive particles in the presence of scalar and gravitational fields, particularly focusing on the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) naked singularity solution. It is shown that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius strongly depends on scalar coupling parameter. Additionally, we explored the radiation reaction effects on particle dynamics, incorporating a reaction term into the motion equations. Numerical simulations indicated minimal impact on particle trajectories from radiation reaction. We also examined the oscillatory motion of particles around compact objects in the JNW spacetime, focusing on radial and vertical oscillations. Our analysis indicated that the scalar field's coupling parameter and the spacetime deformation parameter $n$ significantly alter the fundamental frequencies of these oscillations. Furthermore, we studied quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in X-ray binaries, using the relativistic precession (RP) model to analyze upper and lower frequency relationships. Our results indicated that increasing parameters ($n$ and $g_s$) shifts the frequency ratio of 3:2 QPOs closer to the naked singularity, with $n$ decreasing and $g_s$ increasing both frequencies. Finally, we analyzed QPO data from selected four X-ray binary systems using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain JNW parameters. Our findings provided insights into the mass, coupling and deformation parameter for each system, enhancing our understanding of compact object dynamics in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Wave Metrics in the Cotton and Conformal Killing Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wave metrics in the context of Cotton Gravity and Conformal Killing Gravity. First, we consider pp-wave metrics with flat and non-flat wave surfaces and show that they are exact solutions to the field equations of these theories. More explicitly, the field equations reduce to an inhomogeneous Laplace and Helmholtz differential equations, depending on the curvature of the two-dimensional geometry of the wave surfaces. An interesting point here is that the ones with non-flat wave surfaces are not present in classical GR, which manifests a crucial distinction between these theories and GR. Moreover, we investigate Kerr-Schild-Kundt metrics in the context of these theories and show that, from among these metrics, only the AdS wave metrics solve the field equations of these theories. However, AdS spherical and dS hyperbolic wave metrics do not solve the field equations of these theories, which is in contrast to the classical GR. In the case of AdS wave metrics, the field equations of these theories reduce to an inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation. We give all the necessary and sufficient conditions for the metric function $V$ to solve these field equations. Lastly, we address the colliding gravitational plane waves problem only in Cotton gravity due to the complexity of the field equations in Conformal Killing Gravity.</description>

      <title>A Binary Neutron Star Merger Search Pipeline Powered by Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are now routinely detected from compact binary mergers, with binary neutron star mergers being of note for multi-messenger astronomy as they have been observed to produce electromagnetic counterparts. Novel search pipelines for these mergers could increase the combined search sensitivity, and could improve the ability to detect real gravitational wave signals in the presence of glitches and non-stationary detector noise. Deep learning has found success in other areas of gravitational wave data analysis, but a sensitive deep learning-based search for binary neutron star mergers has proven elusive due to their long signal length. In this work, we present a deep learning pipeline for detecting binary neutron star mergers. By training a convolutional neural network to detect binary neutron star mergers in the signal-to-noise ratio time series, we concentrate signal power into a shorter and more consistent timescale than strain-based methods, while also being able to train our network to be robust against glitches. We compare our pipeline's sensitivity to the three offline detection pipelines using injections in real gravitational wave data, and find that our pipeline has a comparable sensitivity to the current pipelines below the 1 per 2 months detection threshold. Furthermore, we find that our pipeline can increase the total number of binary neutron star detections by 12% at a false alarm rate of 1 per 2 months. The pipeline is also able to successfully detect the two binary neutron star mergers detected so far by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, GW170817 and GW190425, despite the loud glitch present in GW170817.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Lensing From Geodesic Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the gravitational lensing of light or gravitational waves by Schwarzschild black hole in geometric optics. Instead of a single massless particle, we investigate the collective behavior of a congruence of light/gravitational rays, described by the geodesic deviation equation (GDE). By projecting on the Newman-Penrose tetrad, GDE is decoupled, and we find an analytical Dyson-like series solution in the weak deflection and thin lens limits. Based on such a solution, we study the evolution of cross-sectional area and axis ratio. Finally, we reproduce the magnification and axis ratio of the lensing images up to the second order of weak deflection approximation and improve some missing corrections in previous works.</description>

      <title>Anomaly freedom in effective Loop Quantum Cosmology: pedagogical summary and generalized holonomy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of consistency is crucial in quantum gravity. It has recently been intensively addressed for effective symmetry-reduced models. In this article, we exhaustively study the anomaly freedom of effective loop quantum cosmology with generalized holonomy corrections, considering loop correction of the constraints at the perturbative order. We pedagogically explain why, although the holonomy correction -- including the details of the chosen scheme -- applied on the background part of the constraints is crucial, it becomes irrelevant when implemented on perturbative expansions, in the sense that all consequences are "absorbed" in the counter-terms used for the regularization. The possibility of closing the algebra of constraints without counter-terms is also studied. It is argued that, although enforcing a first-class algebra is a strong requirement, this can be achieved in several different ways, often overlooked, which generates ambiguities on the restriction of the form of the generalized holonomy correction. Those ambiguities are examined in details, leading to the conclusion that the consistency of the effective theory for cosmological perturbations, especially when considering scalar modes, cannot be achieved without counter-terms. We also take the opportunity of this work to clarify, as much as possible, all the required steps so that future works have a clear material at disposal. In particular, a highly detailed calculation of all the brackets is provided, emphasizing the (usually implicit) assumptions, hypotheses and manipulations required to ensure the closure of the algebra. Prospects for future works are underlined.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Parameter Space of Inflation Model on the Brane and its Compatibility with the Swampland Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, inflationary models have been studied from different perspectives using different conditions. Now, in this paper, we want to investigate the inverse monomial Inflation $(IMI)$ on the brane. We limit our results to the potentials of the form $\frac{M^{4+\sigma}}{\phi^{\sigma}}$. We calculate some cosmological parameters and then we investigate the satisfaction of the model with some conjectures of the swampland program. We will check the model's compatibility with the refined dS swampland conjecture(RDSSC), further refining the de Sitter swampland conjecture (FRSDC), scalar weak gravity (SWGC), and strong scalar weak gravity conjecture (SSWGC). Despite the incompatibility with (DSSC), We find a specific region of compatibility with other ones which means it satisfied the (FRDSSC) for example with (a=0.982873, b=0.017127, q=2.2). Also, the model is compatible with the (SWGC) with the ($\phi\leq \sigma+2$) condition and consistent with the (SSWGC) with the ($\phi \leq \sqrt{(\sigma+2)(\sigma+1)}$) condition. Since inverse monomial Inflation(IMI) on the brane could satisfy some swampland conjecture simultaneously, it has the potential to be a "real" inflation model of the universe.</description>

      <title>Spin of Primordial Black Holes from Broad Power Spectrum: Radiation Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a study to obtain the initial spin or the nondimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ of primordial black holes (PBHs) created during the radiation dominated phase of the universe from not only nearly monochromatic but also broad curvature power spectra. Motivated by inflation and first-order phase transitions, we consider a power law shape for the curvature perturbation. Although we can naturally neglect the contribution from the length scales smaller than the scale of interest, that from the larger scales may potentially be significant for a broad power spectrum, for which the spin is sensitive to the width of the power spectrum. So, we introduce a width parameter $r_{k}$, the ratio of the largest scale to the length of interest. We find that the root mean square of $a_{*}$ is largest for PBHs created from locally nearly scale invariant curvature power spectra with $r_{k} \sim 3.5$. The upper limit is $\sim 1\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=10^{17}-10^{23}$ g,
  $\sim 1.7\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=1-100 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 2.5\times 10^{-3}$ even for an incredibly large mass of $M=10^{50}$ g.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of self-interacting gravitons: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. The latter has the same classical solutions as general relativity, but different local symmetries. We argue that Weyl transverse gravity also naturally arises from thermodynamic arguments. In particular, we show that thermodynamic equilibrium of local causal diamonds together with the strong equivalence principle encodes the gravitational dynamics of Weyl transverse gravity rather than general relativity. We obtain this result in a self-consistent way, verifying the validity of our initial assumptions, i.e. the proportionality between entropy and area and the different versions of the equivalence principle in Weyl transverse gravity. Furthermore, we extend the thermodynamic derivation of the equations of motion from Weyl transverse gravity to a class of modified theories of gravity with the same local symmetries. For this purpose, we employ the general expression for Wald entropy in such theories.</description>

Abstract: We present thought experiments to measure the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and Bondi-Sachs energy of isolated systems in general relativity. The expression of the Bondi-Sachs energy used in the protocol is likely to have other applications. In particular, it is well-suited to to be promoted to an operator in non-perturbative loop quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation, also know as $E$-model, in the light of current CMB and LSS observations. The inflaton potential in the Einstein frame for this model contains a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential, which alters the predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra of Starobinsky inflation. We obtain these power spectra numerically without using slow-roll approximation and perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on parameters $M$ and $\alpha$ from Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We consider general reheating scenario by varying the number of e-foldings during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, along with the other parameters. We find $\log_{10}\alpha = 0.0^{+1.6}_{-5.6}$, $\log_{10}M= -4.91^{+0.69}_{-2.7}$ and $N_{pivot} = 53.2^{+3.9}_{-5}$ with $95\%$ C. L.. This implies that the present CMB and LSS observations are insufficient to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. We also find that there is no correlation between $N_{pivot}$ and $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Current density induced by a cosmic string in de Sitter spacetime in the presence of two flat boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the vacuum bosonic current density induced by a carrying-magnetic-flux cosmic string in a $(D+1)$-de Sitter spacetime considering the presence of two flat boundaries perpendicular to it. In this setup, the Robin boundary conditions are imposed on the scalar charged quantum field on the boundaries. The particular cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are studied separately. Due to the coupling of the quantum scalar field with the classical gauge field, corresponding to a magnetic flux running along the string's core, a nonzero vacuum expectation value for the current density operator along the azimuthal direction is induced. The two boundaries divide the space in three regions with different properties of the vacuum states. In this way, our main objective is to calculate the induced currents in these three regions. In order to develop this analysis we calculate, for both regions, the positive frequency Wightman functions. Because the vacuum bosonic current in dS space has been investigated before, in this paper we consider only the contributions induced by the boundaries. We show that for each region the azimuthal current densities are odd functions of the magnetic flux along the string. To probe the correctness of our results, we take the particular cases and analyze some asymptotic limits of the parameters of the model. Also some graphs are presented exhibiting the behavior of the current with relevant physical parameter of the system.</description>

      <title>Use Model Averaging instead of Model Selection in Pulsar Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade and a half, adoption of Bayesian inference in pulsar timing analysis has led to increasingly sophisticated models. The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves by various pulsar timing array projects highlighted Bayesian inference as a central tool for parameter estimation and model selection. Despite its success, Bayesian inference is occasionally misused in the pulsar timing community. A common workflow is that the data is analyzed in multiple steps: a first analysis of single pulsars individually, and a subsequent analysis of the whole array of pulsars. A mistake that is then sometimes introduced stems from using the posterior distribution to craft the prior for the analysis of the same data in a second step, a practice referred to in the statistics literature as ``circular analysis.'' This is done to prune the model for computational efficiency. Multiple recent high-profile searches for gravitational waves by pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have this workflow. This letter highlights this error and suggests that Spike and Slab priors can be used to carry out model averaging instead of model selection in a single pass. Spike and Slab priors are proved to be equal to Log-Uniform priors.</description>

      <title>Blind source separation in 3rd generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third generation and future upgrades of current gravitational-wave detectors will present exquisite sensitivities which will allow to detect a plethora of gravitational wave signals. Hence, a new problem to be solved arises: the detection and parameter estimation of overlapped signals. The problem of separating and identifying two signals that overlap in time, space or frequency is something well known in other fields (e.g. medicine and telecommunication). Blind source separation techniques are all those methods that aim at separating two or more unknown signals. This article provides a methodological review of the most common blind source separation techniques and it analyses whether they can be successfully applied to overlapped gravitational wave signals or not, while comparing the limits and advantages of each method.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Haloscopes as Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that dielectric haloscopes like MADMAX, originally designed for detecting axion dark matter, are also very promising gravitational wave detectors. Operated in resonant mode at frequencies around $\mathcal{O}(10\,\text{GHz})$, these detectors benefit from enhanced gravitational wave to photon conversion at the surfaces of a stack of thin dielectric disks. Since the gravitational wave is relativistic, there is an additional enhancement of the signal compared to the axion case due to increased conversion probability of gravitational waves to photons in the vacuum between the disks. A gravitational wave search using a dielectric haloscope imposes stringent requirements on the disk thickness and placement, but relaxed requirements on the disk smoothness. An advantage is the possibility of a broadband or hybrid resonant/broadband operation mode, which extends the frequency range down to $\mathcal{O}(100\,\text{MHz})$. We show that strain sensitivities down to $10^{-21} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ will be possible in the coming years for the broadband setup, while a resonant setup optimized for gravitational waves could even reach $3\times 10^{-23} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ with current technology.</description>

      <title>Dual Gravitational Wave Signatures of Instant Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the instant preheating scenario efficient particle production occurs immediately following the period of inflationary expansion in the early Universe. We demonstrate that instant preheating predicts unique gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from two distinct origins. One source is the bremsstrahlung GWs produced through the decay of superheavy particles, an inevitable consequence of instant preheating. The other is GWs generated from the nonlinear dynamics of the inflaton and coupled scalar fields. Using numerical simulations, we show that the peak of the GW spectrum shifts depending on the coupling constants of the theory. The detection of these dual GW signatures, characteristic of instant preheating, provides novel opportunities for probing the dynamics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian inference on an analytical model of the LISA massive black hole binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black hole binary (MBHB) mergers will be detectable in large numbers by the Lisa Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will thus provide new insights on how they form via repeated dark matter (DM) halo and galaxy mergers. Here we present a simple analytical model to generate a population of MBHB mergers based on a theoretical prescription that connects them to DM halo mergers. The high flexibility of our approach allows us to explore the broad and uncertain range of MBH seeding and growth mechanisms, as well as the different effects behind the interplay between MBH and galactic astrophysics. Such a flexibility is fundamental for the successful implementation and optimisation of the hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation approach that here we apply to the MBHB population of LISA for the first time. Our inferred population hyper-parameters are chosen as proxies to characterise the MBH--DM halo mass scaling relation, the occupation fraction of MBHs in DM halos and the delay between halo and MBHB mergers. We find that LISA will provide tight constraints at the lower-end of the MBH-halo scaling relation, well complementing EM observations which are biased towards large masses. Furthermore, our results suggest that LISA will constrain some features of the MBH occupation fraction at high redshift, as well as merger time delays of the order of a few hundreds of Myr, opening the possibility to constrain dynamical evolution time scales such as the dynamical friction. The analysis presented here constitutes a first attempt at developing a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to the LISA MBHB population, opening the way for several further improvements and investigations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gravity on all scales IV: 3x2pt Fisher forecasts for pixelised phenomenological modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stage IV large scale structure surveys are promising probes of gravity on cosmological scales. Due to the vast model-space in the modified gravity literature, model-independent parameterisations represent useful and scalable ways to test extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we use a recently validated approach of computing the non-linear $3\times 2$pt observables in modified gravity models with a time-varying effective gravitational constant $\mu$ and a gravitational slip $\eta$ that is binned in redshift to produce Fisher forecasts for an LSST Y10-like survey. We also include in our modelling an effective nulling scheme for weak-lensing by applying the BNT transformation that localises the weak-lensing kernel enabling well-informed scale cuts. We show that the combination of improved non-linear modelling and better control of the scales that are modelled/cut yields high precision constraints on the cosmological and modified gravity parameters. We find that 4 redshift bins for $\mu$ of width corresponding to equal incremental $\Lambda$CDM growth is optimal given the state-of-the-art modelling and show how the BNT transformation can be used to mitigate the impact of small-scale systematic effects, such as baryonic feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions are novel probes of fundamental physics, making their precise calculation essential for revealing various mysteries of the early Universe. In this work we propose a framework that enables the consistent calculation of such gravitational waves sourced by sound waves. Starting from the Lagrangian, this framework integrates the calculation of the dynamics of first-order phase transitions in a self-consistent manner, eliminating various approximations typically introduced by conventional methods. At the heart of our approach is the congruous evaluation of the phase transition hydrodynamics that, at every step, is consistently informed by the Lagrangian. We demonstrate the application of our framework using the SM+$|H|^6$ model, deriving the corresponding gravitational wave spectrum. Our framework establishes a robust foundation for the precise prediction of gravitational waves from phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spinors on the total space of a Kaluza-Klein model with fuzzy sphere fibre and geometrically realised Dirac operator on the product. We show that a single massless spinor on the product appears on spacetime as multiplets of spinors with a particular signature of differing masses and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills charges. For example, for the reduced fuzzy sphere isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, a massless spinor appears as two $SU(2)$ doublets and an $SU(2)$ quadruplet in mass ratios $1:5/3:7/3$. Although such signatures do not appear to exactly math the Standard Model, the paper provides proof of concept of the approach, which can be applied to other noncommutative fibre algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize three complementary approaches to pinpoint the exact form of scattering amplitudes in Schwarzschild spacetime. First, we solve the Regge-Wheeler equation perturbatively in the small-frequency regime. We use the obtained solutions to determine the monodromy in the near-spatial infinity region, which leads to a specific partial differential equation on the elements of the scattering matrix. As a result, it can be written in terms of the elements of the infinitesimal generator of the monodromy transformation and an integration constant. This constant is further related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili free energy through the resummation of infinitely many instantons. The quasinormal mode frequencies are also studied in the small-frequency approximation.</description>

Abstract: Scalarization is a mechanism that endows strongly self-gravitating bodies, such as neutron stars and black holes, with a scalar-field configuration. It resembles a phase transition in that the scalar configuration appears only when a certain quantity that characterizes the compact object, for example, its compactness or spin, is beyond a threshold. A critical and comprehensive review of scalarization, including the mechanism itself, theories that exhibit it, its manifestation in neutron stars, black holes and their binaries, potential extension to other fields, and a thorough discussion of future perspectives, is provided.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the different properties of generalized Vaidya spacetime are considered. We define the location of horizons. We show that the apparent horizon can contain the event horizon. The locations of all types of horizons are compared with ones in the usual Vaidya spacetime. We investigate the timelike geodesics in this spacetime. New corrections to Schwarzschild and Vaidya cases appear and we give conditions when these corrections are not negligible. Also, we consider the conformal Killing vector and transform the metric to conformally-static coordinates. We introduce a new constant of motion along null and timelike geodesics, which is generated by a homothetic Killing vector. The conformally-static coordinates allow diagonalizing of the generalized Vaidya spacetime. The surface gravity has been calculated for the dust and stiff fluid cases.</description>

Abstract: The study focuses on the impact of microlensing in modern cosmology and introduces a new framework for the static spherically symmetrical wormhole in terms of the radial equation of state. Following a standard procedure, the study calculates the lensing equation, magnification, and event rate based on the the radial equation of state. The analysis highlights that the image problem of the light source is complex. Furthermore, the study suggests that larger values for the throat radius of the wormhole and the radial equation of state lead to higher event rates. Additionally, it is proposed that the event rate of a wormhole will be larger compared to that of a black hole, provided their masses and distances from the light source and observer are comparable. This study offers the potential to distinguish between a wormhole and a black hole under similar conditions.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Precession for Tests of the Black Hole No Hair Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multipole moments of black holes in general relativity obey certain consistency relations known as the no-hair theorems. The details of this multipolar structure are imprinted into the gravitational waves emitted by binary black holes, particularly if the binary is precessing. If black holes do not obey the vacuum field equations of general relativity, then the no-hair theorems may be broken, and the observed gravitational waves will be modified, thus providing an important test of the no-hair theorems. Recently, analytic solutions to the precession dynamics and inspiral waveforms were computed within the context of binaries possessing non-axisymmetric mass quadrupole moments, which are parametrized by a modulus $q_{m}$ and phase $a_{m}$ with $m = 1,2$ the azimuthal spherical harmonic number. Here, we use a Fisher analysis to study plausible constraints one may obtain on generic, non-axisymmetry quadrupole configurations using current and future ground-based detectors. For non-precessing binaries, we generically find that no meaningful constraints can be placed with current detectors on the non-axisymmetry parameters $(q_{m}, a_{m})$ due to the presence of strong degeneracies with other waveform parameters, while with next generation detectors, only weak constraints are possible. For precessing configurations, the exact value of the uncertainty is strongly dependent on the sky location, system orientation relative to the line of sight, and initial inclination angle of the orbital angular momentum. After averaging over these parameters, we find that with GWTC-3-like events, one should be able to plausibly constraint non-axisymmetric mass quadrupole deviations to $\Delta q_{m} \sim 10^{-2}$ for LIGO at design sensitivity, and $\Delta q_{m} \sim 10^{-4}$ for the same sources with Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the light ring images and the optical appearance of hairy black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behaviors of null geodesics in the spherical symmetric black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) theory with coupling function $f(\Phi)=e^{-2\alpha \Phi}$ are meticulously analyzed. We investigate the effects of coupling constant $\alpha$ on the effective potential of photon trajectories within three ranges, namely $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$, $\alpha =1$ and $\alpha &gt;1$. We find that the thicknesses of lensing and photon rings are smaller at larger $\alpha$ and fixed electric charge in the unit of mass $q$, whereas they are larger at fixed $\alpha$ and larger $q$. This behavior can be described by using the angular Lyapunov exponent $\gamma$ in the vicinity of the critical curve. Remarkably, the behaviors of photon trajectories are found to be more interesting when $\alpha&gt;1$. Namely, the radius of the black hole shadow $R_\text{s}$ becomes to be smaller than the photon sphere radius $r_\text{ph}$ when $\alpha &gt; 1$ and $q&gt;q^*$. Moreover, $R_\text{s}$ goes to zero as $q$ saturates the extremal limit, beyond which the photon orbit becomes absent. Furthermore, we construct the optical appearance of black holes surrounded by optically and geometrically thin accretion disk with three cases of Gralla-Lupsasca-Marrone (GLM) emission profile. Our results indicate that the observed flux originating from the lensing and photon rings exhibits suppression as $\alpha$ increases, while it undergoes amplification with the increasing parameter $q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the nature of a black hole shadow in dynamical spacetimes, we construct an analytical model of a dynamical photon sphere in the context of the Bonnor-Vaidya spacetime. Comparing the resulting photon sphere radius with the one in Vaidya spacetime, we find that the charge always decreases the radius of the photon sphere. We also prove that a naked singularity in Bonnor-Vaidya spacetime, unlike the static Reissner-Nordstrom naked singularity, may cast a shadow, and as a result, it cannot be distinguished from a black hole through its shadow.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational Waveform Model for Detecting Accelerating Inspiraling Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic frequency-domain gravitational waveform model for an inspiraling binary whose center-of-mass undergoes a small acceleration, assumed to be constant during the detection, such as when it orbits a distant tertiary mass. The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect. We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters. We also determine the parameter space where the acceleration is large enough that the wave phase model would have to be extended to nonlinear orders in the acceleration.</description>

      <title>Analytical model of precessing binaries using post-Newtonian theory in the extreme mass-ratio limit I: General Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a fully analytical waveform model for precessing binaries with arbitrary spin vectors using post-Newtonian~(PN) theory in the extreme mass-ratio limit and a hierarchical multi-scale analysis. The analytical model incorporates leading PN order spin precession dynamics from spin-orbit, spin-spin, and quadrupole-monopole couplings, and 2PN order dissipative dynamics truncated to first order in the mass ratio $q \ll 1$. Due to the pure analytic nature of the model, the framework developed herein can readily be extended to both higher PN and higher-$q$ order. Although the PN series is asymptotic to this limit, our results can be used to estimate how precession affects the measurability of certain binary parameters, and to inform and compare with other waveform approximants, such as effective-one-body models, hybrid waveforms, and self-force calculations.</description>

Abstract: We derive a Weyl invariant equation for Gravity by gauging the global Weyl invariance of vacuum Einstein equations. The equation is linear in the curvature and a natural generalization of Einstein equations to Weyl geometry. The system has 5 physical polarizations, two tensor modes, two vectors modes and one scalar, associated to the cosmological constant. An exact black hole solution is found. We study the dynamics on Friedman backgrounds and the evolution of cosmological perturbations. It is shown that cosmological vector modes do not decay in this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of two searches for gravitational waves from the post-merger remnants of the binary neutron star coalescence events GW170817 and GW190425. The searches are fully coherent over 1800~s of data from the 2nd (for GW170817) and 3rd (for GW190425) observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The searches compute the matched filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, and use a piecewise model of the rapidly changing frequency evolution appropriate for young neutron stars. No detection is claimed. The peak root-sum-squared strain upper limit at 50\% detection probability ($h_{\text{rss}}^{50\%})$ of both searches occurs at 1700~Hz and is estimated at $1.64 \times 10^{-22}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for GW170817, and $1.0 \times 10^{-22}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for GW190425. This is the first gravitational wave search for a neutron star remnant of GW190425.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Dirac equation is separated into four differential equations for time-period Majarana fermions in Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Newman-(A)dS spacetimes. Although they can not be transformed into radial and angular equations, the four differential equations yield two algebraic identities. When the electric or magnetic charge is nonzero, they conclude that there is no differentiable time-periodic Majorana fermions outside the event horizon in Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetimes, or between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-dS spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We consider the single-parameter $\mathcal{R}+ c\mathcal{R}^2$ gravitational action and use constraints from astrophysics and the laboratory to derive a natural relation between the coefficient $c$ and the value of the cosmological constant. We find that the renormalisation of $c$ from the energy of the inflationary phase to the infrared, where the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe takes place, is correlated with the evolution of the vacuum energy. Our results suggest that the coefficient of the $\mathcal{R}^2$ term may provide an unexpected bridge between high-energy physics and cosmological phenomena such as inflation and dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Zel'dovich and Polnarev, in their seminal paper [1] extending previous work on the Memory Effect, suggested that a gravitational wave generated by flyby would merely displace the particles. We confirm their prediction numerically by fine-tuning the wave profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2], and then analytically for its approximation by a P\"oschl-Teller potential. Higher-order derivative profiles proposed for gravitational collapse, etc [2] are shortly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical framework for calculating the mass-radius curve of compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time is introduced, with one additional compact spatial dimension. Static, spherically symmetric solutions are considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multidimensional Fermi gas. To model the strong force between baryons, a repulsive potential is introduced, which is linear in the particle number density. The maximal mass of compact stars is calculated for different model parameters, and with a physical parameter choice, it satisfies observational data, meaning that it is possible to model simple, realistic objects within this framework. Based on this comparison, a limiting size for the observational regime of extra dimensions in compact stars is provided, with $r_c \gtrsim 0.2$~fm.</description>

Abstract: The two most common initial data for vacuum axisymmetric spacetimes are the Brill and Teukolsky gravitational waves. The subsequent numerical evolution of these data exhibits distinct properties mainly associated with the critical gravitational collapse. A possible way of understanding these differences is first to look at the linear level, where the Brill waves have a multipolar structure, while the Teukolsky waves have a quadrupolar structure. Despite being structurally distinct at the linear and nonlinear levels, we show that these gravitational wave initial data share an unexpected similarity related to the distribution of ADM mass as a function of the initial wave's amplitude. More specifically, both configurations satisfy a nonextensive relation, commonly seen in systems governed by long range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetogenesis within a quantum bouncing model driven by a scalar field, focusing on various non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field and the scalar field. We test three cases: no coupling, a Cauchy coupling with gradual decay, and a Gaussian coupling with rapid fall-off. By exploring these scenarios, we assess a wide range of coupling strengths across different scales. The scalar field, with an exponential potential, behaves as pressureless matter in the asymptotic past of the contracting phase, as stiff matter around the bounce, and as dark energy during the expanding phase. Our findings reveal that, among the tested cases, only the Gaussian coupling can explain the generation of primordial magnetic fields on cosmological scales.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper [1], we proposed that the quantum states of black hole responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are given by Bell states of Fermi quanta in the interior of black hole. In this paper, we include the effect of tunneling on these entangled states and show that partial tunneling of these Bell states of Fermi quanta give rises to the Page curve of Hawking radiation. We also show that the entirety of information initially stored in the black hole is returned to the outside via the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars: Impacts of Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars have been well studied since they may be relevant to the physical interpretation of some of the observed quasiperiodic oscillations in the magnetar giant flares. In the crustal region of a magnetar, the strong magnetic field can alter the equation of state and composition due to the Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion. In this paper, we study this effect on the crust-confined, torsional oscillation modes of neutron stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic fields in general relativity under the Cowling approximation. Furthermore, the inner and outer crusts are treated consistently based on the nuclear-energy density functional theory. Depending on the magnetic-field configurations, we find that the Landau-Rabi quantization of electrons can change the frequencies of the fundamental torsional oscillation mode of $1.4 M_\odot$ neutron star models with a normal fluid core by about 10\% when the magnetic field strength at the pole reaches the order of $10^{16}$ G. The shift can even approach 20\% at a field strength of $10^{15}$ G for neutron stars with a simple model of superconducting core where the magnetic field is assumed to be expelled completely.</description>

The theory is weakly coupled so that this $S$-matrix exists at all energies. Unlike the Lorentz invariant case, the resulting $S$-matrix is not analytic in the exchanged (complexified) four-momentum. The non-analyticities stem from the LSZ reduction formula, as a consequence of the energy-dependent mixing between the radial and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>

Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the "acceleration-plane analysis" for a variety of samples and the "stacked velocity profile analysis" for a pure binary sample.</description>

      <title>Heavenly metrics, hyper-Lagrangians and Joyce structures</title>

Abstract: In \cite{B3}, Bridgeland defined a geometric structure, named a Joyce structure, conjectured to exist on the space $M$ of stability conditions of a $CY_3$ triangulated category. Given a non-degeneracy assumption, a feature of this structure is a complex hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry on the total space $X = TM$ of the holomorphic tangent bundle. \par Generalising the isomonodromy calculation which leads to the $A_2$ Joyce structure in \cite{BM}, we obtain an explicit expression for a hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry via construction of the isomonodromic flows of a Schr\"odinger equation with deformed polynomial oscillator potential of odd degree $2n+1$. The metric is defined on a total space $X$ of complex dimension $4n$ and fibres over a $2n$--dimensional manifold $M$ which can be identified with the unfolding of the $A_{2n}$-singularity. The hyper-K\"ahler structure is shown to be compatible with the natural symplectic structure on $M$ in the sense of admitting an \textit{affine symplectic fibration} as defined in \cite{BS}. \par Separately, using the additional conditions imposed by a Joyce structure, we consider reductions of Pleba\'nski's heavenly equations that govern the hyper-K\"ahler condition. We introduce the notion of a \textit{projectable hyper-Lagrangian} foliation and show that in dimension four such a foliation of $X$ leads to a linearisation of the heavenly equation. The hyper-K\"ahler metrics constructed here are shown to admit such a foliation.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dominated Cosmology with Woods-Saxon Like Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark energy can be characterized by a canonical scalar field, known as quintessence. Quintessence allows for a dynamical equation of state $-1 \le \omega \le -\frac{1}{3}$. A previous study by Oikonomou and Chatzarakis have shown that a scalar field model with a Woods-Saxon like potential can successfully explain the early inflation. In this work, we consider a quintessence model with a potential of similar form to explain the late time acceleration. The model is studied at late phase assuming flat cosmology, and the model parameters are constrained using Type Ia supernova data and Observational Hubble data. In particular we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for the Bayesian inference of these parameters. We obtain the value of the Hubble constant $H_0 \sim 68 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and the matter energy density parameter $\Omega_{m_0} \sim 0.30 $, which are in close agreement with the values obtained from the Planck CMB data, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model. Computation of the $\chi^2_{min}$, AIC and BIC reveal that this model is slightly preferred according to AIC and $\chi^2_{min}$ criteria, while the $\Lambda$CDM is preferred according to BIC. We demonstrate that the model possesses a stable attractor in the asymptotic future, which confirms the dynamical stability of the model. Thus, this model may be considered as a potential alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM.</description>
