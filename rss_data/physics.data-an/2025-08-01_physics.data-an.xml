      <title>Simulation-based inference for Precision Neutrino Physics through Neural Monte Carlo tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis and Local Influence Diagnostics for an Extreme-Value Regression Model of Anomalous Wind Gusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme events in complex physical systems, such as anomalous wind gusts, often cause significant material and human damage. Their modeling is crucial for risk assessment and understanding the underlying dynamics. In this work, we introduce a local influence analysis to assess the stability of a class of extreme-value Birnbaum-Saunders regression models, which are particularly suited for analyzing such data. The proposed approach uses the conformal normal curvature (CNC) of the log-likelihood function to diagnose the influence of individual observations on the postulated model. By examining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the CNC, we identify influential data points-physical events that disproportionately affect the model's parameters. We illustrate the methodology through a simulation study and apply it to a time series of wind gust data from Itajai, Brazil, where a severe event caused multiple damages and casualties. Our approach successfully pinpoints this specific event as a highly influential observation and quantifies its impact on the fitted model. This work provides a valuable diagnostic tool for physicists and data scientists working with extreme-value models of complex natural phenomena.</description>

      <title>Eddy population based model for the wall-pressure spectrum at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wall-pressure fluctuations beneath turbulent boundary layers drive noise and structural fatigue through interactions between fluid and structural modes. Conventional predictive models for the spectrum--such as the widely accepted Goody model--fail to capture the energetic growth in the subconvective regime that occurs at high Reynolds number, while at the same time over-predicting the variance.
  To address these shortcomings, two semi-empirical models are proposed for the wall-pressure spectrum in canonical turbulent boundary layers, pipes and channels for friction Reynolds numbers $\delta^+$ ranging from 180 to 47 000.
  The models are based on consideration of two eddy populations that broadly represent the contributions to the wall pressure fluctuations from inner-scale motions and outer-scale motions.
  The first model expresses the premultiplied spectrum as the sum of two overlapping log-normal populations: an inner-scaled term that is $\delta^+$-invariant and an outer-scaled term whose amplitude broadens smoothly with $\delta^+$. Calibrated against large-eddy simulations, direct numerical simulations, and recent high-$\delta^+$ pipe data, it reproduces the convective ridge and the emergence of a sub-convective ridge at large $\delta^+$.
  The second model, developed around newly-available pipe data, uses theoretical arguments to prescribe the spectral shapes of the inner and outer populations. By embedding the $\delta^+$ dependence in smooth asymptotic functions, it yields a formulation that varies continuously with $\delta^+$.
  Both models capture the full spectrum and the logarithmic growth of its variance, laying the groundwork for more accurate engineering predictions of wall-pressure fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy and O-information to detect grokking in tensor network multi-class classification problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced machine learning, encompassing both quantum algorithms and quantum-inspired classical methods such as tensor networks, offers promising tools for extracting structure from complex, high-dimensional data. In this work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Financial Time Series: Multifractal and Multiscale Entropy Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employed Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) and Refined Composite Multiscale Sample Entropy (RCMSE) to investigate the complexity of Bitcoin, GBP/USD, gold, and natural gas price log-return time series. This study provides a comparative analysis of these markets and offers insights into their predictability and associated risks. Each tool presents a unique method to quantify time series complexity. The RCMSE and MF-DFA methods demonstrate a higher complexity for the Bitcoin time series than others. It is discussed that the increased complexity of Bitcoin may be attributable to the presence of higher nonlinear correlations within its log-return time series.</description>

      <title>Distribution of lowest eigenvalue in $k$-body bosonic random matrix ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00190v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical investigations demonstrating the result that the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems (say we have $m$ number of bosons) with $k$-body interactions, modeled by Bosonic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal [BEGOE($k$)] and Unitary [BEGUE($k$)] random matrix Ensembles of $k$-body interactions, exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like (for $k = 1$) to a modified Gumbel like (for intermediate values of $k$) to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution (for $k = m$) form. We also provide ansatz for centroids and variances of the lowest eigenvalue distributions. In addition, we show that the distribution of normalized spacing between the lowest and the next lowest eigenvalues exhibits a transition from Wigner's surmise (for $k = 1$) to Poisson (for intermediate $k$ values with $k \le m/2$) to Wigner's surmise (starting from $k = m/2$ to $k = m$) form. We analyze these transitions as a function of $q$ parameter defining $q$-normal distribution for eigenvalue densities.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a $50\,\mu$s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.\\ Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.\\ In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>
