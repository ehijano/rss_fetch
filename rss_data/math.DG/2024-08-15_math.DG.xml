      <title>Bounds on the geodesic distances on the Stiefel manifold for a family of Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give bounds on geodesic distances on the Stiefel manifold, derived from new geometric insights. The considered geodesic distances are induced by the one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021), which contains the well-known Euclidean and canonical metrics. First, we give the best Lipschitz constants between the distances induced by any two members of the family of metrics. Then, we give a lower and an upper bound on the geodesic distance by the easily computable Frobenius distance. We give explicit families of pairs of matrices that depend on the parameter of the metric and the dimensions of the manifold, where the lower and the upper bound are attained. These bounds aim at improving the theoretical guarantees and performance of minimal geodesic computation algorithms by reducing the initial velocity search space. In addition, these findings contribute to advancing the understanding of geodesic distances on the Stiefel manifold and their applications.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ geometry of hyperbolic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the $L^2$ metric on the moduli space of hyperbolic monopoles, defined using the Coulomb gauge-fixing condition, diverges. This article shows that an alternative gauge-fixing condition inspired by supersymmetry cures this divergence. The resulting geometry is a hyperbolic analogue of the hyperk\"ahler geometry of Euclidean monopole moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic characterizations of biconservative surfaces in the 4-dimensional hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the investigation of biconservative surfaces with parallel normalized mean curvature vector fields (PNMC) in the 4-dimensional space forms, focusing on the hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^4, the last remaining case to explore. We establish that an abstract surface admits a PNMC biconservative immersion in \mathbb{H}^4 if and only if it satisfies a certain intrinsic condition; if such an immersion exists, it is unique. We further analyze these abstract surfaces, showing that they form a two-parameter family. Additionally, we provide three characterizations of the intrinsic condition to explore the geometric properties of these surfaces.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces of constant scalar curvature in hyperbolic space with prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the asymptotic Plateau problem in hyperbolic space, and we prove the existence of a smooth complete hypersurface of constant scalar curvature in hyperbolic space with a prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity. Following a pioneering work of Bo Guan and Joel Spruck, we seek the solution as a graph over a bounded domain and solve the corresponding Dirichlet problem by establishing the crucial second order estimates for admissible solutions.
  Our proof consists of three main ingredients: (1) a new test function, (2) a so-called almost-Jacobi inequality for the equation operator, and (3) a set of arguments which reduce the situation to semi-convex case and which keep the coefficient of the troublesome negative term in a suitable magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energetically most efficient way how a deformed red blood cell regains equilibrium is mathematically described by the gradient flow of the Canham-Helfrich functional, including a spontaneous curvature and the conservation of surface area and enclosed volume. Using a recently discovered multiplicity inequality, we prove global existence and convergence of smooth solutions for spheres and axisymmetric tori, provided the initial energy lies below explicit thresholds.</description>

      <title>Width, Largeness and Index Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.13754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we review some recent developments related to metric aspects of scalar curvature from the point of view of index theory for Dirac operators. In particular, we revisit index-theoretic approaches to a conjecture of Gromov on the width of Riemannian bands $M \times [-1,1]$, and on a conjecture of Rosenberg and Stolz on the non-existence of complete positive scalar curvature metrics on $M \times {\mathbb R}$. We show that there is a more general geometric statement underlying both of them implying a quantitative negative upper bound on the infimum of the scalar curvature of a complete metric on $M \times {\mathbb R}$ if the scalar curvature is positive in some neighborhood. We study ($\hat{A}$-)iso-enlargeable spin manifolds and related notions of width for Riemannian manifolds from an index-theoretic point of view. Finally, we list some open problems arising in the interplay between index theory, largeness properties and width.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Lorentzian Weyl spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10163v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the local form of all non-closed Lorentzian Weyl manifolds $(M,c,\nabla)$ with recurrent curvature tensor.If the dimension of the manifold is greater than 3, then the conformal structure is flat, and the recurrent Weyl structure is locally determined by a single function. Two local structures are equivalent if and only if the corresponding functions are related by a transformation from $\mathrm{SAff}_1(\mathbb{R}) \times \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We find generators for the field of rational scalar differential invariants of this Lie group action. The global structure of the manifold $M$ may be described in terms of a foliation with a transversal projective structure. It is shown that all locally homogeneous structures are locally equivalent, and there is only one simply connected homogeneous non-closed recurrent Lorentzian Weyl manifold. Moreover, there are 5 classes of cohomogeneity-one spaces, and all other spaces are of cohomogeneity-two. If $\dim M=3$, the non-closed recurrent Lorentzian Weyl structures are locally determined by one function of two variables or two functions of one variables, depending on whether its holonomy algebra is 1- or 2-dimensional. In this case, two structures with the same holonomy algebra are locally equivalent if and only if they are related, respectively, by a transformation from an infinite-dimensional Lie pseudogroup or a 4-dimensional subgroup of $\mathrm{Aff}(\mathbb R^3)$. Again we provide generators for the field of rational differential invariants. We find a local expression for the locally homogeneous non-closed recurrent Lorentzian Weyl manifolds of dimension 3, and also of those of cohomogeneity one and two. In the end we give a local description of the non-closed recurrent Lorentzian Weyl manifolds that are also Einstein-Weyl. All of them are 3-dimensional and have a 2-dimensional holonomy algebra.</description>

      <title>Harmonic almost complex structures on almost abelian Lie groups and solvmanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An almost abelian Lie group is a solvable Lie group with a codimension-one normal abelian subgroup. We characterize almost Hermitian structures on almost abelian Lie groups where the almost complex structure is harmonic with respect to the Hermitian metric. Also, we adapt the Gray-Hervella classification of almost Hermitian structures to the family of almost abelian Lie groups. We provide several examples of harmonic almost complex structures in different Gray-Hervella classes on some associated compact almost abelian solvmanifolds.</description>

      <title>Pushforward of currents under Sobolev maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a Sobolev map from a Riemannian manifold into a complete metric space pushes forward almost every compactly supported integral current to an Ambrosio--Kirchheim integral current in the metric target, where "almost every" is understood in a modulus sense.
  As an application, we prove that when the target supports an isoperimetric inequality of Euclidean type for integral currents, an isoperimetric inequality for Sobolev mappings relative to bounded, closed and additive cochains follows.
  Using the results above, we answer positively to an open question by Onninen and Pankka on sharp H\"older continuity for quasiregular curves. A key tool in the continuity proof is Almgren's isoperimetric inequality for integral currents.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give some simple conditions under which a Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian submanifold of a K\"ahler-Einstein manifold must have a Euclidean factor or be a fiber bundle over a circle. We also characterize the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is non-negative and whose mean curvature vector is in some $L^p$ space when the ambient space is a simply connected complex space form.</description>

      <title>Generalized positive scalar curvature on spin$^c$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,L)$ be a (compact) non-spin spin$^c$ manifold. Fix a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ and a connection $A$ on $L$, and let $D_L$ be the associated spin$^c$ Dirac operator. Let $R^{tw}_{(g,A)}:=R_g + 2ic(\Omega)$ be the twisted scalar curvature (which takes values in the endomorphisms of the spinor bundle), where $R_g$ is the scalar curvature of $g$ and $2ic(\Omega)$ comes from the curvature $2$-form $\Omega$ of the connection $A$. Then the Lichnerowicz-Schr\"odinger formula for the square of the Dirac operator takes the form $D_L^2 =\nabla^*\nabla+\frac{1}{4}R^{tw}_{(g,A)}$. In a previous work we proved that a closed non-spin simply-connected spin$^c$-manifold $(M,L)$ of dimension $n\geq 5$ admits a pair $(g,A)$ such that $R^{tw}_{(g,A)}&gt;0$ if and only if the index $\alpha^c(M,L):=\text{ind}\, D_L$ vanishes in $K_n$. In this paper we introduce a scalar-valued generalized scalar curvature $R^{gen}_{(g,A)}:=R_g - 2|\Omega|_{op}$, where $|\Omega|_{op}$ is the pointwise operator norm of Clifford multiplication $c(\Omega)$, acting on spinors. We show that the positivity condition on the operator $R^{tw}_{(g,A)}$ is equivalent to the positivity of the scalar function $R^{gen}_{g,A}$. We prove a corresponding trichotomy theorem concerning the curvature $R^{gen}_{(g,A)}$, and study its implications. We also show that the space $\mathcal{R}^{gen+}(M,L)$ of pairs $(g,A)$ with $R^{gen}_{(g,A)}&gt;0$ has non-trivial topology, and address a conjecture about non-triviality of the ``index difference'' map.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if a simply connected non-conformally flat conformal Lorentzian manifold $(M,c)$ admits an essential transitive group of conformal transformations, then there exists a metric $g\in c$ such that $(M,g)$ is a complete homogeneous plane wave. We also prove that the group of conformal transformations of a non-conformally flat simply connected homogeneous plane wave $(M,g)$ consists of homotheties, hence it is a 1-dimensional extension of the group of isometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Z$ be a compact, connected $3$-dimensional complex manifold with vanishing first and second Betti numbers and non-vanishing Euler characteristic. We prove that there is no holomorphic mapping from $Z$ onto any $2$-dimensional complex space. In other words, $Z$ can only possibly fiber over a curve. This result applies in particular to a class of threefolds, known as Clemens threefolds, which are diffeomorphic to a connected sum $k \# (S^3 \times S^3)$ for $k \geq 2$. This result also gives a new restriction on any hypothetical complex structure on the $6$-sphere $S^6$.</description>
