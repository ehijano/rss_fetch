      <title>Changing-Look AGN Powered By Disk Tearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\,M_\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.</description>

      <title>Searching for Long-Period Radio Transients in ASKAP EMU Data with 10-Second Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a recently identified phenomenon that challenge our current understanding of compact objects and coherent radio emission mechanisms. These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy. Our findings evaluate the feasibility of detecting radio transients using 10-second imaging with ASKAP and provide insights into improving detection pipelines and observation strategies for LPTs.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Diffuse Neutrino Emission from the Milky Way with GALPROP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) propagation framework to model the diffuse neutrino and gamma-ray emissions from the Galaxy. A collection of realistic bounding models are developed and predictions of the resulting neutrino and gamma-ray signals are compared to the IceCube and LHAASO data up to PeV energies. We find that all the GALPROP models are consistent with the neutrino data within uncertainties. They are also consistent with expectations of neutrino emissions derived from LHAASO data when accounting for possible gamma-ray point source contamination. The new models present state-of-the-art predictions for the VHE neutrino emissions from the Galaxy that may be used for future neutrino searches.</description>

      <title>A precessing magnetic jet as the engine of GRB 250702B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P ~ 2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening angle tension without invoking late energy injection. "Missing" pulses in the second and third cycles occur naturally when low amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight. The model yields concrete, falsifiable predictions, providing a self consistent explanation of GRB 250702B radiative and outflow anomalies.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron radiation from NGC 470 HLX1 - a hidden hyperluminous accreting neutron star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first broadband spectral analysis of NGC 470 HLX1, a hyperluminous X-ray source that exhibits significant flux variability over different epochs. We investigate the feasibility of synchrotron radiation with varying latitude from a magnetized neutron star to explain the source's spectra. We also shed light on the particle acceleration mechanisms and maximum Lorentz factor of electrons within the neutron star magnetospheric plasma under super-Eddington accretion conditions. In our broadband spectral modeling, the detection of a blackbody-like component suggests the presence of a disk near the corotation radius or an outflow ejected from the disk. The viability of synchrotron emission in an HLX system offers new insights about the nature of these sources, motivating further sample studies to assess whether most of these sources are powered by accreting neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN Disks Density Profiles through Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black holes surrounded by a gaseous disk have been a prevailing model to explain a wide spectrum of astrophysical phenomena related to active galactic nucle (AGNs). However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\times10^{-11}\rm g/cm^3$. Our work opens up an exciting new channel to investigate the very center of galaxies, where disk gas density distributions $\rho(r)$ can be recovered by analyzing time-dependent environmental imprints in gravitational waveforms.</description>

      <title>Curious Case of CGRaBS J0211+1051: Observational Evidence of Lepto-Hadronic Origin of High-Energy Emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object CGRaBS J0211+1051, which has been gathered over more than ten years with many observatories. Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E&gt;10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets.</description>

      <title>Using the Cherenkov Telescope onboard EUSO-SPB2 for Target of Opportunity searches of very high energy neutrino sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) mission launched from Wanaka New Zealand on May 13, 2023. The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $&gt;10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\circ \times 12.8^\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign. We also calculate upper limits on the neutrino fluences from sources observed during the ToO campaign. Our observations demonstrate the viability of conducting ToO follow-up observations from a near space environment with future balloon missions, such as the pathfinder mission POEMMA-Balloon with Radio.</description>

      <title>Disk warping and black hole X-ray binaries I. Tentative unification of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray binaries exhibit complex variability patterns studied in the power-spectrum. These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions. This offers a first path toward unifying the variability of black hole X-ray binary.</description>

      <title>Shapiro Delay Measurements from Fifteen Years of PSR J1231$-$1411 Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 15 years of Nan\c{c}ay and Green Bank radio telescope timing observations for PSR J1231$-$1411. This millisecond pulsar is a primary science target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer telescope (NICER, which discovered its X-ray pulsations), has accumulated near-continuous $\gamma$-ray data since the Fermi-Large Area Telescope's launch, and has been studied extensively with the Green Bank and Nan\c{c}ay radio telescopes. We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nature of the most extreme Galactic particle accelerator. H.E.S.S. observations of the microquasar V4641 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars have emerged as promising candidates to explain the cosmic-ray flux at petaelectronvolt energies. LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$\sigma$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\lesssim3$~$\mu$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641~Sgr system.</description>

      <title>UHECRs Propagation and their Multimessengers: Upper limits and the Impact of the Extragalactic Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy astrophysical multimessengers establishes a connection between ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and powerful cosmic accelerators. Interactions of UHECRs with radiation fields and interstellar matter generate very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays and neutrinos, making them key components in the multimessenger framework. This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068. Combining gamma-ray, neutrino, and UHECR observations reinforces the importance of multimessenger approaches in understanding the nature of high-energy astrophysical sources and their role in cosmic-ray acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of a sub-GeV $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge boson. We find discrepancies with existing literature in sensitivity projections for the upcoming SHiP experiment and in the treatment of supernovae cooling constraints. We present a quantitative analysis of different production modes in beam dumps and compare our results to previous work. In the context of supernovae, we re-evaluate the standard supernova cooling bounds from SN1987A and analyze additional supernova-based probes: diffusive cooling, constraints from the existence of low-energy supernovae, and the absence of a high-energy neutrino signal from SN1987A.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the TAIGA-HiSCORE Data Using the Latent Space of Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of extensive air shower (EAS) analysis is to reconstruct the physical parameters of the primary particle that initiated the shower. The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.</description>

      <title>Finite Populations &amp; Finite Time: The Non-Gaussianity of a Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova feedback effects on globular clusters of different masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the impact of Type Ia supernova (SN) explosions on the star formation history and chemical properties of second-generation (SG) stars in young globular clusters with masses of 10^5-10^6 Msun. We assume that the SG is formed out of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta of first-generation stars plus pristine interstellar medium gas which is modelled as a uniform gas moving at a constant velocity towards the cluster. We tested two values for the infalling gas density of 10^(-24) and 10^(23) g/cm^3. Type Ia SNe start to explode together with the release of gas from the most massive AGB stars. Three simulated models are analyzed. In the low-mass and low-density scenario, we find that SNe Ia quench star formation which however restarts when the gas cools down again in between two explosions. SG stars are dominated by a He-rich population (Y&gt;0.33), which is poorly diluted by pristine gas. In the high-mass models, star formation is mildly affected, while the He composition is significantly altered as exploding SNe prevent the accretion of pristine gas and therefore extremely helium-rich stars form. In the high-density model, such weak gas accretion leads to a maximum enhancement in helium mass fraction much larger than the observed one and not correlating with the initial cluster mass as found in models without Type Ia SNe. As for the iron content, small spreads have been found in all models, but the SG is less homogeneous than the FG, at variance with current observations.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Temperature Analytically In Hydrodynamics Simulations with Gas and Radiation Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a hot galactic halo around the Andromeda Galaxy using fast radio bursts along two sightlines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients that serve as unique probes of ionized extragalactic matter. We report the discovery and localization of two FRBs piercing the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with the realfast transient-detection system at the Very Large Array. These unique sightlines enable constraints on M31's electron density distribution. We localized FRB 20230930A to a host galaxy at redshift $z=0.0925$ and FRB 20230506C to a host galaxy at redshift $z=0.3896$. After accounting for the dispersion contributions from the Milky Way, the host galaxies, and the intergalactic medium, we estimate M31's contribution to be $26-239$ $\rm pc~cm^{-3}$ toward FRB 20230930A and $51-366$ $\rm pc~cm^{-3}$ toward FRB 20230506C, within the 90% credible interval (CI). By modeling the M31 disk's contribution, we isolate the halo component and find that M31's halo contributes $7-169$ $\rm pc~cm^{-3}$ along FRB 20230930A (90% CI). The inferred values of $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ from the FRBs are consistent with predictions from a modified Navarro-Frenk-White (mNFW) profile at the corresponding impact parameter. The cool and warm phase gas is unlikely to account for the $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ unless the ionization fraction is as high as 90%. While limited to two sightlines, these results offer tentative evidence for the existence of a hot halo surrounding M31. We also discuss the potential contribution of other foreground structures, particularly in explaining the DM excess observed in FRB 20230506C. This work demonstrates how FRBs can be used to probe the circumgalactic medium of intervening galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxies of Fast Radio Bursts Track a Combination of Stellar Mass and Star Formation, Similar to Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new statistical framework for studying the host galaxies of astrophysical sources that accounts for both redshift evolution and the multi-variate nature of host-galaxy properties. These aspects are critical when dealing with sources that span a wide range of redshifts, and/or with unknown redshift-dependent selection effects. We apply our method to a sample of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host-galaxies as a means of probing the uncertain progenitor(s) of these events. Using our method we are able to rule out that FRBs track star-formation rate (SFR), as would be expected if FRBs are associated exclusively with young neutron stars born via core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Furthermore, we rule out a recently proposed metallicity-dependent model whereby FRBs track SFR only above an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) ~ 8. Motivated by the fact that at least one FRB has been localized to a globular cluster (GC), we also investigate the hypothesis that FRB sources track GC mass and explicitly rule out this scenario. Alternatively, we find that a `mixed' model whereby FRBs track a linear combination of both SFR and stellar-mass best explains the data. The preferred parameters of such a mixed model are similar to those inferred for Type Ia SNe, and implies a possible connection between the progenitors of these different transients.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae III: Linking Spectral and Light Curve Modeling of the GW170817 Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed spectra and light curves of the kilonova produced by the GW170817 binary neutron star merger provide complementary insights, but modeling both the spectral- and time-domain has proven challenging. Here, we model the optical/infrared light curves of the GW170817 kilonova, using the properties and physical conditions of the ejecta as inferred from detailed modeling of its spectra. Using our software tool SPARK, we first infer the r-process abundance pattern of the kilonova ejecta from spectra obtained at 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4 days post-merger. From these abundances, we compute time-dependent radioactive heating rates and the wavelength-, time-, and velocity-dependent opacities of the ejecta. We use these inferred heating rates and opacities to inform a kilonova light curve model, to reproduce the observed early-time light curves and to infer a total ejecta mass of $M_{\mathrm{ej}} = {0.11}~M_{\odot}$, towards the higher end of that inferred from previous studies. The combination of a large ejecta mass from our light curve modeling and the presence of both red and blue ejecta from our spectral modeling suggests the existence of a highly magnetized hypermassive neutron star remnant that survives for $\sim$$0.01 - 0.5$ s and launches a blue wind, followed by fast, red neutron-rich winds launched from a magnetized accretion disk. By modeling both spectra and light curves together, we demonstrate how combining information from both the spectral and time domains can more robustly determine the physical origins of the ejected material.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate parameter estimation of high-redshift sources with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections-on the order of $10^5$ per year-which makes current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use Dingo-IS to perform neural posterior estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that NPE correctly recovers the eight degenerate sky modes induced by the triangular detector geometry, missed by the FIM analysis, resulting in an underestimation of sky localization uncertainties for most sources. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of $\sim 3$ on average when the injected luminosity distance is $d^{\mathrm{inj}}_{\mathrm{L}} &gt; 10^5~$Mpc, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation channel(s) and for estimating the retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters. However, the determination is complicated by MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 64 field MSP systems that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. Assuming that the Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ are statistically stable over time (the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption), we approached the distribution of the $v_\mathrm{l}$ components of $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ by the observed $v_\mathrm{l}$ sample. We find that the observed $v_\mathrm{l}$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Accordingly, the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components under the assumption that $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of field MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.68 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\approx14$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster with the nominal 50 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of field MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in globular clusters, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as field MSP systems.</description>

      <title>Studying the black widow pulsars PSR J0312$-$0921 and PSR J1627$+$3219 in the optical and X-rays</title>

Abstract: Context. PSR J0312$-$0921 and PSR J1627$+$3219 are black widow pulsars with orbital periods of 2.34 and 3.98 hours. They were recently detected in the radio and $\gamma$-rays. Aims. Our goals are to estimate the fundamental parameters of both binary systems and their components. Methods. We performed first phase-resolved multi-band photometry of both objects with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming direct heating of the companion by the pulsar. Archival X-ray data obtained with the Swift and XMM-Newton observatories were also analysed. Results. For the first time, we firmly identified both systems in the optical. Their optical light curves show a rather symmetric single peak per orbital period and a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\gtrsim$2 mag. We also identified the X-ray counterpart to J1627$+$3219, while for J0312$-$0921 we set an upper limit on the X-ray flux. Conclusions. We estimated the masses of the pulsars, companion temperatures and masses, Roche lobe filling factors, orbital inclinations, and the distances to both systems. PSR J0312$-$0921 has a very light ($\approx$0.02 M$_\odot$) companion which possibly has one of the lowest ($\approx$1600 K) `night-side' temperatures among the known black widow systems. We found that the distances to J0312$-$0921 and J1627$+$3219 are about 2.5 and 4.6 kpc, respectively. This likely explains their faintness in X-rays. The X-ray spectrum of PSR J1627$+$3219 can be described by the power-law model, and its parameters are compatible with those obtained for other black widows.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics for accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) theory for a dilute electron-ion gas governed by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation, using the method of moments. This yields an extended MHD framework beyond standard astrophysical formulations, which typically include only the shear-stress component parllel to the magnetic field. We analyze our framework in the linear regime and show that it leads to the firehose instability when the bakground longitudinal pressure becomes large. In these extreme scenario, the transverse and semi-transverse shear-stress components become large and may play a role in accretion disk dynamics.</description>

      <title>Can "premature collapse" form black holes in the upper and lower mass gaps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a "premature collapse" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spectral characteristics of the periodic burster 4U 1323-62: Type-I X-ray burst and persistent emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U 1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with GWTC-3</title>

Abstract: The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 1.27 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec LRD and non-LRD broad H$\alpha$ emitters in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-$z$ ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies exhibiting broad H$\alpha$ emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding 1,000 km/s. This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000${\AA} has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Massive Boson Stars using Gravitational Waves from Fundamental Oscillations</title>

Abstract: Boson Stars are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects would manifest as dark Boson stars and, in the absence of electromagnetic signatures, could mimic properties of compact stars in the gravitational wave spectrum. In a recent study, using the simplest potential for massive Boson stars, we demonstrated that fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) obey scaling relations that allow them to be distinguished from neutron stars and black holes. In this work, we provide analytical fits for these scaling relations, valid for the dark matter parameter space compatible with current astrophysical and cosmological data, that can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive Boson stars in the strong coupling regime, avoiding the need for numerical calculations. We also provide analytical fits for empirical and universal relations for gravitational wave asteroseismology, which can be used to infer microscopic dark matter properties following a successful detection. Further, we investigate the possibility of detection of $f$-modes and the dark matter parameter space that can be probed with current and future gravitational wave detectors across multiple frequency bands. Assuming a burst gravitational wave model and demanding a signal-to-noise ratio of 5, we show that the current and future detectors can, in principle, probe Boson star $f$-modes up to cosmological distances: 1 Mpc with aLIGO, 30 Mpc with Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, and in the best case scenario, about 300 Mpc with LISA.</description>

Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event, dubbed KM3-230213A. This is the first observed neutrino event with energy of the order of $\mathcal{O}(100) {\rm PeV}$, the origin of which remains unclear. In this paper, we interpret this high energy neutrino event in terms of the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\chi$ decays via the right-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses and mixings. Furthermore, the Dirac fermion dark matter $\chi$ is assumed to be charged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the dark Higgs $\Phi$. In this scenario, DM can decay into a pair of Standard Model (SM) particles, such as neutrinos, leptons, and gauge bosons via the RH neutrino portals for $v_\Phi \gg m_\chi$. Then we can reply on the HDMSpectra package to generate the neutrino and $\gamma$-ray spectra from heavy DM decays. If the DM mass is around $440\ {\rm PeV}$ with a lifetime $5\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event. However, such heavy DM cannot be produced through the thermal freeze-out mechanism due to overproduction and violation of unitarity bounds. We focus on the UV freeze-in production of DM through a dimension-5 operator, which helps in producing the DM dominantly in the early Universe. Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the intriguing possibility of generating gravitational waves (GWs) spectra from cosmic strings. We have found a reasonable set of parameter values that can address the KM3NeT signal, yield the correct value of the DM relic density through freeze-in mechanism, and allow for the possible detection of GW signal at the future detectors.</description>

      <title>$g$-mode oscillations of dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>

Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environments around Black Holes from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially revealing the properties of the dark sector and shedding light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.</description>
