      <title>Fast particle trajectories and integrability in quasiaxisymmetric and quasihelical stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even if the magnetic field in a stellarator is integrable, phase-space integrability for energetic particle guiding center trajectories is not guaranteed. Both trapped and passing particle trajectories can experience convective losses, caused by wide phase-space island formation, and diffusive losses, caused by phase-space island overlap. By locating trajectories that are closed in the angle coordinate but not necessarily closed in the radial coordinate, we can quantify the magnitude of the perturbation that results in island formation. We characterize island width and island overlap in quasihelical (QH) and quasiaxisymmetric (QA) finite-beta equilibria for both trapped and passing energetic particles. For trapped particles in QH, low-shear toroidal precession frequency profiles near zero result in wide island formation. While QA transit frequencies do not cross through the zero resonance, we observe that island overlap is more likely since higher shear results in the crossing of more low-order resonances.</description>

      <title>The High-Order Magnetic Near-Axis Expansion: Ill-Posedness and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When analyzing stellarator configurations, it is common to perform an asymptotic expansion about the magnetic axis. This so-called near-axis expansion is convenient for the same reason asymptotic expansions often are, namely, it reduces the dimension of the problem. This leads to convenient and quickly computed expressions of physical quantities, such as quasisymmetry and stability criteria, which can be used to gain further insight. However, it has been repeatedly found that the expansion diverges at high orders, limiting the physics the expansion can describe. In this paper, we show that the near-axis expansion diverges in vacuum due to ill-posedness and that it can be regularized to improve its convergence. Then, using realistic stellarator coil sets, we show that the near-axis expansion can converge to ninth order in the magnetic field, giving accurate high-order corrections to the computation of flux surfaces. We numerically find that the regularization improves the solutions of the near-axis expansion under perturbation, and we demonstrate that the radius of convergence of the vacuum near-axis expansion is correlated with the distance from the axis to the coils.</description>

      <title>Laser initiated p-11B fusion reactions in petawatt high-repetition-rates laser facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving the nuclear fusion reaction p+11B -&gt; 3 alpha + 8.7 MeV in laboratory conditions, by interaction between high-power laser pulses and matter, has become a popular field of research, due to numerous applications that it can potentially allow: an alternative to deuterium-tritium (DT) for fusion energy production, astrophysics studies and alpha-particle generation for medical treatments. A possible scheme for laser-driven p-11B reactions is to direct a beam of laser-accelerated protons onto a boron sample (the so-called 'pitcher-catcher' scheme). This technique was successfully implemented on large, energetic lasers, yielding hundreds of joules per shot at low repetition. We present here a complementary approach, exploiting the high-repetition rate of the VEGA III petawatt laser at CLPU (Spain), aiming at accumulating results from many interactions at much lower energy, for better controlling the parameters and the statistics of the measurements. Despite a moderate energy per pulse, our experiment allowed exploring the laser-driven fusion process with tens (up to hundreds) of laser shots. The experiment provided a clear signature of the produced reactions and of the fusion products, accumulated over many shots, leading to an improved optimization of the diagnostic for these experimental campaigns In this paper we discuss the effectiveness of the laser-driven p-11B fusion in the pitcher-catcher scheme, at high-repetition rate, addressing the challenges of this experimental scheme and highlighting its critical aspects. Our proposed methodologies allow evaluating the performance of this scheme for laser-driven alpha particle production and can be adapted to high-repetition rate laser facilities with higher energy and intensity.</description>

      <title>Construction of an invertible mapping to boundary conforming coordinates for arbitrarily shaped toroidal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary conforming coordinates are commonly used in plasma physics to describe the geometry of toroidal domains, for example, in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium solvers. The magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium configuration can be approximated with an inverse map, defining nested surfaces of constant magnetic flux. For equilibrium solvers that solve for this inverse map iteratively, the initial guess for the inverse map must be well defined and invertible. Even if magnetic islands are to be included in the representation, boundary conforming coordinates can still be useful, for example to parametrize the interface surfaces in multi-region, relaxed magnetohydrodynamics. Given a fixed boundary shape, finding a valid boundary conforming mapping can be challenging, especially for the non-convex boundaries from recent developments in stellarator optimization. In this work, we propose a new algorithm to construct such a mapping, by solving two Dirichlet-Laplace problems via a boundary integral method. We can prove that the generated harmonic map is always smooth and has a smooth inverse. Furthermore, we can find a discrete approximation of the mapping that preserves this property.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reference frame PIC simulations for electron beam dynamics with meter-scale propagation inside plasma and under external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle in cell simulations are widely used in most fields of physics to investigate known and new phenomena which cannot be directly observed or measured yet. However, the computational and time resources needed for PICs make them impractical when high resolution and long time/distance simulations are required. In this work, we present a new PIC simulation code that takes advantage of the use of a relativistic reference frame and consequent time dilation and length contraction. These properties make a simulation capable of long (meter length) and high resolution simulations without the need of supercomputers. This new code is a step forward with regards to the previous tries enabling complex multiple body situations without additional filtering and smoothing of fields and currents. The usefulness of the relativistic frame PIC code is displayed by simulating electron beam bunching obtained in long undulator propagation and also the potential as a beam "buncher" of 10s of cm long low density plasmas.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the electron distribution function during gas ionization by a sub-nanosecond microwave pulse of hundreds MW power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron velocity distribution function in the plasma, formed by gas ionization with a sub-nanosecond, hundreds of megawatts power level microwave pulse, is studied by a theoretical model and by numerical 3D simulations, the results of which agree well and show that the distribution varies along the pulse as a decreasing power-law function at the rear of the pulse. Experiments performed in a waveguide filled with helium gas confirm that energetic (from several keV to several tens of keV) electrons remain in plasma long after the pulse has crossed the experimental volume. These electrons continue the gas ionization over extended times up to tens of nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Dynamic properties of the warm dense uniform electron gas with the qSTLS dielectric scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently derived Fourier--Matsubara expansion of imaginary--time correlation functions comprises an exact result of linear response theory for finite-temperature quantum many-body systems. In its density--density version, the expansion facilitates systematic comparisons between quasi-exact \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations and approximate dielectric formalism schemes at the level of the imaginary--time (density--density) correlation functions and the dynamic Matsubara local field corrections. On this theoretical basis, the dynamic properties of the quantum version of the Singwi--Tosi--Land--Sj\"olander scheme are analyzed for the paramagnetic warm dense uniform electron gas. The marginal improvement compared to the semi-classical version of the Singwi--Tosi--Land--Sj\"olander scheme is attributed to the weak Matsubara order dependence of the approximate dynamic Matsubara local field correction. The evaluation of the ideal density response function at the non-interacting occupation numbers is identified to constitute a general deficiency of the dielectric formalism, which calls for a reformulation in future works.</description>

      <title>Kinetic structure of strong-field QED showers in crossed electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete, kinetic description of electron-seeded strong-field QED showers in crossed electromagnetic fields is derived. The kinetic structure of the shower and its temporal evolution are shown to be a function of two parameters: the initial shower quantum parameter and radiation time. The latter determines the short and long time evolution of the shower. Explicit solutions for the shower multiplicity (number of pairs per seed electron) and the emitted photon spectrum are obtained for both timescales. Our approach is first derived considering showers in a constant, homogeneous magnetic field. We find that our results are valid for any crossed fields and we apply them to laboratory settings for which we obtain fully analytical, predictive scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Photon acceleration of high-intensity vector vortex beams into the extreme ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources allow for the probing of bound electron dynamics on attosecond scales, interrogation of high-energy-density matter, and access to novel regimes of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. Despite the importance of these applications, coherent XUV sources remain relatively rare, and those that do exist are limited in their peak intensity and spatio-polarization structure. Here, we demonstrate that photon acceleration of an optical vector vortex pulse in the moving density gradient of an electron beam-driven plasma wave can produce a high-intensity, tunable-wavelength XUV pulse with the same vector vortex structure as the original pulse. Quasi-3D, boosted-frame particle-in-cell simulations show the transition of optical vector vortex pulses with 800-nm wavelengths and intensities below $10^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ to XUV vector vortex pulses with 36-nm wavelengths and intensities exceeding $10^{20}$ W/cm$^2$ over a distance of 1.2 cm. The XUV pulses have sub-femtosecond durations and nearly flat phase fronts. The production of such high-quality, high-intensity XUV vector vortex pulses could expand the utility of XUV light as a diagnostic and driver of novel light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Stellar Systems: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar systems - star clusters, galaxies, dark matter haloes, and so on - are ubiquitous characters in the evolutionary tale of our Universe. This tutorial article is an introduction to the collective dynamical evolution of the very large numbers of stars and/or other self-gravitating objects that comprise such systems, i.e. their kinetic theory.
  We begin by introducing the basic phenomenology of stellar systems, and explaining why and when we must develop a kinetic theory that transcends the traditional two-body relaxation picture of Chandrasekhar. We study the orbits that comprise stellar systems, how those orbits are modified by perturbations, how a system responds self-consistently to fluctuations in its gravitational potential, and how one can predict the long term fate of a stellar system in various dynamical regimes. Though our treatment is necessarily mathematical, we develop the formalism only to the extent that it facilitates real calculations. We give many examples throughout the text of the equations being applied to topics of major astrophysical importance.
  Furthermore, in the 1960s and 1970s the kinetic theory of stellar systems was a fledgling subject which developed in tandem with the kinetic theory of plasmas. However, the two fields have long since diverged. Yet once one has become fluent in both Plasmaish and Galacticese, and has a dictionary relating the two, one can pull ideas directly from one field to solve a problem in the other. Therefore, another aim of this tutorial article is to provide our plasma colleagues with a jargon-light understanding of the key properties of stellar systems, to point out the many direct analogies between stellar- and plasma-kinetic calculations, and ultimately to convince them that stellar dynamics and plasma kinetics are, in a deep and beautiful and useful sense, the same thing.</description>

      <title>Collisionless conduction in a high-beta plasma: a collision operator for whistler turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulation of electron heat transport in high-beta, weakly collisional, magnetized plasma is investigated. A temperature gradient oriented along a mean magnetic field can induce a kinetic heat-flux-driven whistler instability (HWI), which back-reacts on the transport by scattering electrons and impeding their flow. Previous analytical and numerical studies have shown that the heat flux for the saturated HWI scales as the inverse of electron beta. These numerical studies, however, had limited scale separation and consequently large fluctuation amplitudes, which calls into question their relevance at astrophysical scales. To this end, we perform a series of particle-in-cell simulations of the HWI across a range of electron beta and temperature-gradient length scales under two different physical setups. The saturated heat flux in all of our simulations follows the expected inverse-electron-beta scaling, supporting the robustness of the result. We also use our simulation results to develop and implement several methods to construct an effective collision operator for whistler turbulence. The results point to an issue with the standard quasi-linear explanation of HWI saturation, which is analogous to the well-known 90-degree scattering problem in the cosmic ray community. Despite this limitation, the methods developed here can serve as a blueprint for future work seeking to characterize the effective collisionality caused by kinetic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>
