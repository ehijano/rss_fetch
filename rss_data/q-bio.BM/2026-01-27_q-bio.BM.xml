      <title>AI Developments for T and B Cell Receptor Modeling and Therapeutic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating progress in modeling T and B cell receptors by enabling predictive and generative frameworks grounded in sequence data and immune context. This chapter surveys recent advances in the use of protein language models, machine learning, and multimodal integration for immune receptor modeling. We highlight emerging strategies to leverage single-cell and repertoire-scale datasets, and optimize immune receptor candidates for therapeutic design. These developments point toward a new generation of data-efficient, generalizable, and clinically relevant models that better capture the diversity and complexity of adaptive immunity.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Cliff: A Critical Proton Tunneling Threshold Determines Clinical Severity in RPE65-Mediated Retinal Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18435</link>

Abstract: Predicting clinical severity from genotype remains a fundamental challenge in molecular medicine, particularly for enzymes whose function depends on sub-atomic-scale geometry. Mutations in the \textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the "Quantum Cliff," where minute structural changes (below 0.1 \AA) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling.</description>

      <title>Conditioned Generative Modeling of Molecular Glues: A Realistic AI Approach for Synthesizable Drug-like Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18716</link>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid beta-42 (Abeta-42), contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Abeta-42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation. This integrated approach offers a promising framework for designing UPS-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Multiview Random Vector Functional Link Network for Predicting DNA-Binding Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) is essential due to their significant impact on various biological activities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying protein-DNA interactions is essential for elucidating various life activities. In recent years, machine learning-based models have been prominently utilized for DBP prediction. In this paper, to predict DBPs, we propose a novel framework termed a multiview random vector functional link (MvRVFL) network, which fuses neural network architecture with multiview learning. The MvRVFL model integrates both late and early fusion advantages, enabling separate regularization parameters for each view, while utilizing a closed-form solution for efficiently determining unknown parameters. The primal objective function incorporates a coupling term aimed at minimizing a composite of errors stemming from all views. From each of the three protein views of the DBP datasets, we extract five features. These features are then fused together by incorporating a hidden feature during the model training process. The performance of the proposed MvRVFL model on the DBP dataset surpasses that of baseline models, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We further validate the practicality of the proposed model across diverse benchmark datasets, and both theoretical analysis and empirical results consistently demonstrate its superior generalization performance over baseline models.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Contrastive Learning with Fine-Grained Binding Representations for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.</description>
