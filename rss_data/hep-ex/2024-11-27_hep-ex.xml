      <title>Constraints on standard model effective field theory for a Higgs boson produced in association with W or Z bosons in the H$\to\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ decay channel in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) analysis with dimension-six operators probing nonresonant new physics effects is performed in the Higgs-strahlung process, where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W or Z boson, in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The final states in which the W or Z boson decays leptonically and the Higgs boson decays to a pair of bottom quarks are considered. The analyzed data were collected by the CMS experiment between 2016 and 2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. An approach designed to simultaneously optimize the sensitivity to Wilson coefficients of multiple SMEFT operators is employed. Likelihood scans as functions of the Wilson coefficients that carry SMEFT sensitivity in this final state are performed for different expansions in SMEFT. The results are consistent with the predictions of the standard model.</description>

      <title>Solar Model Independent Constraints on the Sterile Neutrino Interpretation of the Gallium Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of most up-to-date solar neutrino data and KamLAND reactor antineutrino data in the framework of the 3+1 sterile neutrino mixing scenario (invoked to explain the results of the Gallium source experiments) with the aim of quantifying the dependence of the (in)compatibility of the required mixing with assumptions on the initial fluxes. The analysis of solar data is performed in two alternative ways: using the flux predicted by the latest standard solar models, and in a model independent approach where the solar fluxes are also determined by the fit. The dependence on the normalization of the capture rate in the solar Gallium experiments is also quantified. Similarly, in the KamLAND analysis we consider both the case where the reactor flux normalization is assumed to be known \textit{a priori}, as well as a normalization free case which relies solely on available neutrino data. Using a parameter goodness of fit test, we find that in most cases the compatibility between Gallium and solar+KamLAND data only occur at the $3\sigma$ level or higher. We also discuss the implications of enforcing better compatibility by tweaking the mechanism for the energy production in the Sun.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino charges at beam experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to constrain neutrino charges at neutrino beam experiments. Uncharged in the Standard Model, evidence for a neutrino electric charge would be a smoking gun for new physics, shedding light on the Dirac or Majorana nature of neutrinos, and giving insight into the origin of charge quantisation. We find that using the most sensitive magnetometers available, existing beam experiments could constrain neutrino charges $|q_{\nu}| \lesssim 10^{-12}$, in units of the electron charge, whilst future upgrades could strengthen these bounds significantly. We also discuss electromagnetic dipole moments and show that our proposal is highly sensitive to new long-range forces.</description>

      <title>Search for single production of vector-like $T$ quarks decaying into $Ht$ or $Zt$ in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes a search for the single production of an up-type vector-like quark ($T$) decaying as $T \rightarrow Ht$ or $T \rightarrow Zt$. The search utilises a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector during the 2015-2018 data-taking period of the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosityof 139 fb$^{-1}$. Data are analysed in final states containing a single lepton with multiple jets and $b$-jets. The presence of boosted heavy resonances in the event is exploited to discriminate the signal from the Standard Model background. No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and 95% CL upper limits are set on the production cross section of $T$ quarks in different decay channels. The results are interpreted in several benchmark scenarios to set limits on the mass and universal coupling strength ($\kappa$) of the vector-like quark. For singlet $T$ quarks, $\kappa$ values above 0.53 are excluded for all masses below 2.3 TeV. At a mass of 1.6 TeV, $\kappa$ values as low as 0.35 are excluded. For $T$ quarks in the doublet scenario, where the production cross section is much lower, $\kappa$ values above 0.72 are excluded for all masses below 1.7 TeV, and this exclusion is extended to $\kappa$ above 0.55 for low masses around 1.0 TeV.</description>

      <title>Method to Reduce Noise for Measurement of $^7$Be and $^8$B Solar Neutrinos on Gallium-71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10157v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gallium solar neutrino experiments have historically used radiochemical counting to determine the event rate. A detector which directly measures the ejected electron and de-excitation gamma could reduce background counting rates by way of a double-pulse technique. We find this reduction could be as large as 10 orders of magnitude in a 100 ton detector. In this process, the detector measures the excited nuclear final state of the germanium after an electron neutrino interacts with gallium nucleus through the charged-current interaction. This results in a loss of approximately 90\% of the total neutrino signal, but higher energy processes are less suppressed. The neutrinos resulting from this higher energy selection are predominantly from the {}$^8$B and {}$^7$Be solar neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>Search for new phenomena with top-quark pairs and large missing transverse momentum using 140 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is conducted for new phenomena in events with a top quark pair and large missing transverse momentum, where the top quark pair is reconstructed in final states with one isolated electron or muon and multiple jets. The search is performed using the Large Hadron Collider proton--proton collision data sample at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. An analysis based on neural network classifiers is optimised to search for directly produced pairs of supersymmetric partners of the top quark (stop), and to search for spin-0 mediators, produced in association with a pair of top quarks, that decay into dark-matter particles. In the stop search, the analysis is designed to target models in which the mass difference between the stop and the neutralino from the stop decay is close to the top quark mass. This new search is combined with previously published searches in final states with different lepton multiplicities. No significant excess above the Standard Model background is observed, and limits at 95% confidence level are set. Models with neutralinos with masses up to 570 GeV are excluded, while for small neutralino masses models are excluded for stop masses up to 1230 GeV. Scalar (pseudoscalar) dark matter mediator masses as large as 350 (370) GeV are excluded when the coupling strengths of the mediator to Standard Model and dark-matter particles are both set to one. At lower mediator masses, models with production cross-sections as small as 0.15 (0.16) times the nominal predictions are excluded. Results of this search are also used to set constraints on effective four-fermion contact interactions between top quarks and neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: We present preliminary results of a partial-wave analysis of $\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$ using data from the Belle experiment at the KEKB $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collider. We validate our model with a model-independent analysis. We see the $\mathrm{a}_1(1420)$ and a G-parity-violating $1^-[\omega(782)\pi]_\mathrm{P}$ wave in tauon decays. Our results will improve models used in simulation studies necessary for measuring the electric and magnetic dipole moments and Michel parameters of the $\tau$.</description>

      <title>Signal partitioning in superfluid ${}^4$He: a Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superfluid ${}^4$He is an ideal candidate for the direct detection of light dark matter via nuclear recoils thanks to its low nuclear mass and the possibility to reach a low detection energy threshold by exploiting the generated quasiparticles. The design of future detectors based on this target, such as the DELight experiment, requires a proper understanding of the formation and partitioning of the signal for different energy depositions from various sources. This work presents an overview of the physical processes involved in the energy deposition of recoiling electrons and ions, and describes a Monte Carlo approach to the partitioning of the signal into different channels. Despite an overall good agreement with existing literature, differences in the region of interest for light dark matter searches below 200 eV are observed.</description>

      <title>Equivariant neural networks for robust $\textit{CP}$ observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the usage of equivariant neural networks in the search for violations of the charge-parity ($\textit{CP}$) symmetry in particle interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We design neural networks that take as inputs kinematic information of recorded events and that transform equivariantly under the a symmetry group related to the $\textit{CP}$ transformation. We show that this algorithm allows to define observables reflecting the properties of the $\textit{CP}$ symmetry, showcasing its performance in several reference processes in top quark and electroweak physics. Imposing equivariance as an inductive bias in the algorithm improves the numerical convergence properties with respect to other methods that do not rely on equivariance and allows to construct optimal observables that significantly improve the state-of-the-art methodology in the searches considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel simulation of a strongly interacting dark sector also known as the Hidden Valley scenarios using angular ordered showers and the cluster hadronisation model in Herwig 7. We discuss the basics of this implementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the help of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector parameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study correlation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular structure of these events. Finally we comment on the uncertainties introduced due to lack of knowledge of hadronisation parameters within the dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Machine learning tagged boosted dark photon: A signature of fermionic portal matter at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use machine learning techniques to identify a boosted dark photon jet as a signature of a heavy vector-like fermionic portal matter (PM) connecting the visible and the dark sectors. In this work, the fermionic PM which mixes only with the standard model (SM) third generation up-type quark, dominantly decays to a top quark and dark photon pair. The dark photon then $promptly$ decays to a pair of standard model fermions via the gauge kinetic mixing. We have analyzed two different final states, namely, (i) exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet, and (ii) at least two tagged dark photons and at least one tagged top quark jet at the 13 and 14 TeV LHC center of mass energies. Both these final states receive significant contributions from the pair and single production processes of the top partner. The rich event topology of the signal processes, $i.e.$, the presence of a boosted dark photon and top quark jet pair, along with the fact that the invariant mass of the system corresponds to the mass of the top partner, help us to significantly suppress the potential SM backgrounds. We have shown that one can set a $2\sigma$ exclusion limit of $2.6$ TeV on the top partner mass with $\sin\theta_L=0.1$ and assuming $100\%$ branching ratio of the top partner in the exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet final state at the 14 TeV LHC center of mass energy assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have conducted the first simultaneous global fit of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel using the energy-energy correlators (EEC) of $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions in the back-to-back limit. This analysis, based on the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization of EEC at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic ($\rm{N}^{3} \rm{LL}$) accuracy, yields $\alpha_s$ consistent with the world average. We have tested two different parametrizations for the non-perturbative CS kernel and found both to align with results obtained from lattice QCD and fits on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan process.</description>

      <title>Properties of the tensor state $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and decays of the exotic tensor meson $T$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are explored in the context of the diquark-antidiquark model. We treat it as a state built of axial-vector diquark $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }c$ and antidiquark $\overline{b}\gamma _{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this tetraquark are extracted from two-point sum rules. Our result for $m=(12.70 \pm 0.09)~\mathrm{GeV}$ proves that $T$ is unstable against strong dissociations to two-meson final states. Its dominant decay channels are processes $T \to J/\psi \Upsilon $, $ \eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, and $B_{c}^{(\ast) +}B_{c}^{(\ast) -}$. Kinematically allowed transformations of $T$ include also decays $T\rightarrow D^{(\ast )+}D^{(\ast )-}$ and $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, which are generated by $b\overline{b}$ annihilation inside of $T$. The full width of $ T $ is estimated by considering all of these channels. Their partial widths are calculated by invoking methods of three-point sum rule approach which are required to evaluate strong couplings at corresponding tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions for the mass and width $ \Gamma_{T}=(117.4 \pm 15.9)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor state $T$ provide useful information for experimental studies of fully heavy four-quark exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation within Chained Models for Machine Learning Reconstruction of Neutrino-LAr Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>

Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>
