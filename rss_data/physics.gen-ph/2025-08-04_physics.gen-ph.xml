      <title>Bi-Constructible pattern of weak and flavour mixing: implications for electroweak coupling constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present semi-empirical evidence suggesting that weak and flavour mixing, at the most fundamental level, can be described in terms of the Euclidean geometry of regular polygons constructible with compass and straightedge, specifically, the pentagon and the heptadecagon, associated with Fermat primes -- a pattern referred to as Bi-Constructible. Our approach accurately reproduces quark and lepton mixing angles and offers indications that the Weinberg angle also fits naturally within this geometric framework. Concise Weak--Quark--Lepton Complementarity relations are derived. These findings suggest a semi-empirical unification pattern of weak and flavour mixing. The Standard Model gauge couplings g and g' admit elegant expressions involving the golden ratio, yielding a neat prediction for the fine-structure constant entirely in these terms.</description>

      <title>Closed timelike curves in PT-symmetric wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00035v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a modified Einstein-Rosen wormhole model, made unidirectionally traversable through a bimetric geometry defined by two regular metrics, g(+) and g(-), and characterized by PT symmetry combining time reversal (t -&gt; -t) and spatial inversion (x -&gt; -x). In this framework, two distinct spacetime regions are identified at the wormhole throat (r = alpha) via PT symmetry, forming a single spacetime sheet. This model employs Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to eliminate coordinate singularities at the throat, enabling traversability with a lightlike membrane of exotic matter at the junction to satisfy the Einstein field equations, similar to other traversable wormhole models. We extend this model by coupling two such wormholes to generate closed timelike curves (CTCs), made possible by the opposing causal orientations defined by the two metrics, while adhering to Novikov's self-consistency principle. An effective theory is developed for a scalar field crossing the wormhole, yielding PT-symmetric Klein-Gordon equations with a real energy spectrum ensured by pseudo-unitarity, consistent with quantum mechanical dynamics. These results open new avenues for exploring the effects of PT symmetry on causality and the quantization of scalar fields in traversable geometries.</description>

      <title>Is Quantum Mechanics a proper subset of Classical Mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is widely regarded as a complete theory, yet we argue it is a tractable projection of a deeper, computationally-inaccessible classical variational structure. By analyzing the coupled partial differential equations of the Hamilton type 1 principal function, we show that classical action-based dynamics are generally undecidable, paralleling spectral gap undecidability in quantum systems. In near Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser systems, stability hinges on Diophantine conditions that are themselves undecidable, limiting predictability via arithmetic logic rather than randomness. Phenomena like spin 3/2 systems and larger, quantum scars and Leggett inequality violations support this view, naturally explained by time symmetric classical action. This framework offers a principled resolution to the long standing dichotomy between unitarity and entanglement by deriving both as emergent features of a tractable rendering from a fundamentally non-separable classical variational geometry. Collapse and decoherence arise from representational limits, not ontological indeterminism. We propose an explicit experimental test using lateral double quantum dots to detect predicted deviations from standard quantum coherence at the classical chaos threshold. This reframing suggests the classical quantum boundary is set by computability and not by the Planck constant. Implications for quantum computing and quantum encryption are discussed.</description>
