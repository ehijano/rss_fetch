      <title>Replication of Reference-Dependent Preferences and the Risk-Return Trade-Off in the Chinese Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study replicates the findings of Wang et al. (2017) on reference-dependent preferences and their impact on the risk-return trade-off in the Chinese stock market, a unique context characterized by high retail investor participation, speculative trading behavior, and regulatory complexities. Capital Gains Overhang (CGO), a proxy for unrealized gains or losses, is employed to explore how behavioral biases shape cross-sectional stock returns in an emerging market setting. Utilizing data from 1995 to 2024 and econometric techniques such as Dependent Double Sorting and Fama-MacBeth regressions, this research investigates the interaction between CGO and five risk proxies: Beta, Return Volatility (RETVOL), Idiosyncratic Volatility (IVOL), Firm Age (AGE), and Cash Flow Volatility (CFVOL). Key findings reveal a weaker or absent positive risk-return relationship among high-CGO firms and stronger positive relationships among low-CGO firms, diverging from U.S. market results, and the interaction effects between CGO and risk proxies, significant and positive in the U.S., are predominantly negative in the Chinese market, reflecting structural and behavioral differences, such as speculative trading and diminished reliance on reference points. The results suggest that reference-dependent preferences play a less pronounced role in the Chinese market, emphasizing the need for tailored investment strategies in emerging economies.</description>

      <title>New financial ratios based on the compositional data methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their type of mathematical construction, the use of standard financial ratios in studies analysing the financial health of a group of firms leads to a series of statistical problems that can invalidate the results obtained. These problems are originated by the asymmetry of financial ratios. The present article justifies the use of a new methodology using compositional data (CoDa) to analyse the financial statements of a sector, improving analyses using conventional ratios since the new methodology enables statistical techniques to be applied without encountering any serious drawbacks such as skewness and outliers, and without the results depending on the arbitrary choice as to which of the accounting figures is the numerator of the ratio and which is the denominator. An example with data of the wine sector is provided. The results show that when using CoDa, outliers and skewness are much reduced and results are invariant to numerator and denominator permutation.</description>

      <title>Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</description>
