      <title>On User Association in Large-Scale Heterogeneous LEO Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of large-scale heterogeneous low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks in the context of three association schemes. In contrast to existing studies, where single-tier LEO satellite-based network deployments are considered, the developed framework captures the heterogeneous nature of real-world satellite network deployments. More specifically, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the performance of multi-tier LEO satellite-based networks, where the locations of LEO satellites are approximated as points of independent Poisson point processes, with different density, transmit power, and altitude. We propose three association schemes for the considered network topology based on: 1) the Euclidean distance, 2) the average received power, and 3) a random selection. By using stochastic geometry tools, analytical expressions for the association probability, the downlink coverage probability, as well as the spectral efficiency are derived for each association scheme, where the interference is considered. Moreover, we assess the achieved network performance under several different fading environments, including low, typical, and severe fading conditions, namely non-fading, shadowed-Rician and Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. Our results reveal the impact of fading channels on the coverage probability, and illustrate that the average power-based association scheme outperforms in terms of achieved coverage and spectral efficiency performance against the other two association policies. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of the proposed association schemes and the network topology on the optimal number of LEO satellites, providing guidance for the planning of multi-tier LEO satellite-based networks in order to enhance network performance.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Level Modeling of Photonic Deep Neural Network Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics is a promising technology to accelerate Deep Neural Networks as it can use optical interconnects to reduce data movement energy and it enables low-energy, high-throughput optical-analog computations.
  To realize these benefits in a full system (accelerator + DRAM), designers must ensure that the benefits of using the electrical, optical, analog, and digital domains exceed the costs of converting data between domains. Designers must also consider system-level energy costs such as data fetch from DRAM. Converting data and accessing DRAM can consume significant energy, so to evaluate and explore the photonic system space, there is a need for a tool that can model these full-system considerations.
  In this work, we show that similarities between Compute-in-Memory (CiM) and photonics let us use CiM system modeling tools to accurately model photonics systems. Bringing modeling tools to photonics enables evaluation of photonic research in a full-system context, rapid design space exploration, co-design, and comparison between systems.
  Using our open-source model, we show that cross-domain conversion and DRAM can consume a significant portion of photonic system energy. We then demonstrate optimizations that reduce conversions and DRAM accesses to improve photonic system energy efficiency by up to 3x.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Logic Weight based Coordination Scheme for Utilizing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The larger battery capacities and the longer waiting and charging time of electric vehicles (EVs) results in low utilization of charging stations (CSs). This paper, proposes fuzzy logic weight based coordination (FLWC) scheme to enhance the utilization of CSs. Each EV has an associated uncertain information including stay time and the current state-of-charge (SoC). The fuzzy logic controller (FLC) analyze these inputs and determines a weight value. The proposed FLWC scheme then allocates CSs to the EVs according to the weight values. The proposed scheme is simulated for 100 EVs and 5 CSs using Matlab. The simulation result shows about 30% improvement in the average utilization of CSs as compared to first-come-first-serve (FCFS) based scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging from the symbiotic combination of nanotechnology and communications, the field of nanonetworking has come a long way since its inception more than fifteen years ago. Significant progress has been achieved in several key communication technologies as enablers of the paradigm, as well as in the multiple application areas that it opens. In this paper, the focus is placed on the electromagnetic nanonetworking paradigm, providing an overview of the advances made in wireless nanocommunication technology from microwave through terahertz to optical bands. The characteristics and potential of the compared technologies are then confronted with the requirements and challenges of the broad set of nanonetworking applications in the Internet of NanoThings (IoNT) and on-chip networks paradigms, including quantum computing applications for the first time. Finally, a selection of cross-cutting issues and possible directions for future work are given, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners towards the next generation of electromagnetic nanonetworks.</description>

      <title>Molecular Docking via Weighted Subgraph Isomorphism on Quantum Annealers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is an essential step in the drug discovery process involving the detection of three-dimensional poses of a ligand inside the active site of the protein. In this paper, we address the Molecular Docking search phase by formulating the problem in QUBO terms, suitable for an annealing approach. We propose a problem formulation as a weighted subgraph isomorphism between the ligand graph and the grid of the target protein pocket. In particular, we applied a graph representation to the ligand embedding all the geometrical properties of the molecule including its flexibility, and we created a weighted spatial grid to the 3D space region inside the pocket. Results and performance obtained with quantum annealers are compared with classical simulated annealing solvers.</description>

      <title>Auditing an Automatic Grading Model with deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of deep reinforcement learning to audit an automatic short answer grading (ASAG) model. Automatic grading may decrease the time burden of rating open-ended items for educators, but a lack of robust evaluation methods for these models can result in uncertainty of their quality. Current state-of-the-art ASAG models are configured to match human ratings from a training set, and researchers typically assess their quality with accuracy metrics that signify agreement between model and human scores. In this paper, we show that a high level of agreement to human ratings does not give sufficient evidence that an ASAG model is infallible. We train a reinforcement learning agent to revise student responses with the objective of achieving a high rating from an automatic grading model in the least number of revisions. By analyzing the agent's revised responses that achieve a high grade from the ASAG model but would not be considered a high scoring responses according to a scoring rubric, we discover ways in which the automated grader can be exploited, exposing shortcomings in the grading model.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computation with Minimum Circuit Execution Time over Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present quantum computers are constrained by limited qubit capacity and restricted physical connectivity, leading to challenges in large-scale quantum computations. Distributing quantum computations across a network of quantum computers is a promising way to circumvent these challenges and facilitate large quantum computations. However, distributed quantum computations require entanglements (to execute remote gates) which can incur significant generation latency and, thus, lead to decoherence of qubits. In this work, we consider the problem of distributing quantum circuits across a quantum network to minimize the execution time. The problem entails mapping the circuit qubits to network memories, including within each computer since limited connectivity within computers can affect the circuit execution time. We provide two-step solutions for the above problem: In the first step, we allocate qubits to memories to minimize the estimated execution time; for this step, we design an efficient algorithm based on an approximation algorithm for the max-quadratic-assignment problem. In the second step, we determine an efficient execution scheme, including generating required entanglements with minimum latency under the network resource and decoherence constraints; for this step, we develop two algorithms with appropriate performance guarantees under certain settings or assumptions. We consider multiple protocols for executing remote gates, viz., telegates and cat-entanglements. With extensive simulations over NetSquid, a quantum network simulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform a scheme based on prior work by up to 95%.</description>

      <title>Empirical Application Insights on Industrial Data and Service Aspects of Digital Twin Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin networks (DTNs) serve as an emerging facilitator in the industrial networking sector, enabling the management of new classes of services, which require tailored support for improved resource utilization, low latencies and accurate data fidelity. In this paper, we explore the intersection between theoretical recommendations and practical implications of applying DTNs to industrial networked environments, sharing empirical findings and lessons learned from our ongoing work. To this end, we first provide experimental examples from selected aspects of data representations and fidelity, mixed-criticality workload support, and application-driven services. Then, we introduce an architectural framework for DTNs, exposing a more practical extension of existing standards; notably the ITU-T Y.3090 (2022) recommendation. Specifically, we explore and discuss the dual nature of DTNs, meant as a digital twin of the network and a network of digital twins, allowing the co-existence of both paradigms.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Benchmarking of Quantum Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking the performance of quantum optimization algorithms is crucial for identifying utility for industry-relevant use cases. Benchmarking processes vary between optimization applications and depend on user-specified goals. The heuristic nature of quantum algorithms poses challenges, especially when comparing to classical counterparts. A key problem in existing benchmarking frameworks is the lack of equal effort in optimizing for the best quantum and, respectively, classical approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive set of guidelines comprising universal steps towards fair benchmarks. We discuss (1) application-specific algorithm choice, ensuring every solver is provided with the most fitting mathematical formulation of a problem; (2) the selection of benchmark data, including hard instances and real-world samples; (3) the choice of a suitable holistic figure of merit, like time-to-solution or solution quality within time constraints; and (4) equitable hyperparameter training to eliminate bias towards a particular method. The proposed guidelines are tested across three benchmarking scenarios, utilizing the Max-Cut (MC) and Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The benchmarks employ classical mathematical algorithms, such as Branch-and-Cut (BNC) solvers, classical heuristics, Quantum Annealing (QA), and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).</description>

      <title>Breaking the Molecular Dynamics Timescale Barrier Using a Wafer-Scale System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have transformed our understanding of the nanoscale, driving breakthroughs in materials science, computational chemistry, and several other fields, including biophysics and drug design. Even on exascale supercomputers, however, runtimes are excessive for systems and timescales of scientific interest. Here, we demonstrate strong scaling of MD simulations on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine. By dedicating a processor core for each simulated atom, we demonstrate a 179-fold improvement in timesteps per second versus the Frontier GPU-based Exascale platform, along with a large improvement in timesteps per unit energy. Reducing every year of runtime to two days unlocks currently inaccessible timescales of slow microstructure transformation processes that are critical for understanding material behavior and function. Our dataflow algorithm runs Embedded Atom Method (EAM) simulations at rates over 270,000 timesteps per second for problems with up to 800k atoms. This demonstrated performance is unprecedented for general-purpose processing cores.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Energy-Efficient Wireless Tire Sensing System with Delay Analysis for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to a rise in the popularity of intelligent vehicles that incorporate a range of sensors to monitor various aspects, such as driving speed, fuel usage, distance proximity and tire anomalies. Nowadays, real-time tire sensing systems play important roles for intelligent vehicles in increasing mileage, reducing fuel consumption, improving driving safety, and reducing the potential for traffic accidents. However, the current tire sensing system drains a significant vehicle' energy and lacks effective collection of sensing data, which may not guarantee the immediacy of driving safety. Thus, this paper designs an energy-efficient wireless tire sensing system (WTSS), which leverages energy-saving techniques to significantly reduce power consumption while ensuring data retrieval delays during real-time monitoring. Additionally, we mathematically analyze the worst-case transmission delay and sensor reception ratio of the system to ensure the immediacy based on the collision probabilities of sensor transmissions. This system has been implemented and verified by the simulation and field train experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme provides enhanced performance in energy efficiency up to 76.5% in average and identifies the worst transmission delay accurately.</description>

      <title>Highly Reproducible and CMOS-compatible VO2-based Oscillators for Brain-inspired Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With remarkable electrical and optical switching properties induced at low power and near room temperature (68C), vanadium dioxide (VO2) has sparked rising interest in unconventional computing among the phase-change materials research community. The scalability and the potential to compute beyond the von Neumann model make VO2 especially appealing for implementation in oscillating neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to solve constraint satisfaction problems, and for pattern recognition. Its integration into large networks of oscillators on a Silicon platform still poses challenges associated with the stabilization in the correct oxidation state and the ability to fabricate a structure with predictable electrical behavior showing very low variability. In this work, the role played by the different annealing parameters applied by three methods (slow thermal annealing, flash annealing, and rapid thermal annealing), following the vanadium oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD), on the formation of VO2 grains is studied and an optimal substrate stack configuration that minimizes variability between devices is proposed. Material and electrical characterizations are performed on the different films and a step-by-step recipe to build reproducible VO2-based oscillators is presented, which is argued to be made possible thanks to the introduction of a hafnium oxide (HfO2) layer between the silicon substrate and the vanadium oxide layer. Up to seven nearly identical VO2-based devices are contacted simultaneously to create a network of oscillators, paving the way for large-scale implementation of VO2 oscillating neural networks.</description>
