      <title>On semantics of first-order justification logic with binding modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first order logic of proofs $FOLP^\Box$ in the joint language combining justification terms and binding modalities. The main issue is Kripke--style semantics for this logic. We describe models for $FOLP^\Box$ in terms of valuations of individual variables instead of introducing constants to the language. This approach requires a new format of the evidence function. This allows us to assign semantic meaning to formulas that contain free variables. The main results are soundness and completeness of $FOLP^\Box$ with respect to the described semantics.</description>

      <title>Applications of Interval-based Temporal Separation: the Reactivity Normal Form, Inverse $\Pi$, Craig Interpolation and Beth Definability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how interval-based temporal separation on the extension of Moszkowski's discrete time interval temporal logic (Moszkowski, 1986) by the neighbourhood modalities (ITL-NL) and a lemma which is key in establishing this form of separation in (Guelev and Moszkowski, 2022) can be used to obtain concise proofs of an interval-based form of the reactivity normal form as known from (Manna and Pnueli, 1990), the inverse of the temporal projection operator from (Halpern, Manna and Moszkowski, 1983), the elimination of propositional quantification in ITL-NL and, consequently, uniform Craig interpolation and Beth definability for ITL-NL.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Barrier in Uniform Class Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08149v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a strong structural obstruction to Uniform Separation in constructive arithmetic. The mechanism is independent of semantic content; it emerges whenever two distinct evaluator predicates are sustained in parallel and inference remains uniformly representable in an extension of HA. Under these conditions, any putative Uniform Class Separation principle becomes a distinguished instance of a fixed point construction. The resulting limitation is stricter in scope than classical separation barriers (Baker; Rudich; Aaronson et al.) insofar as it constrains the logical form of uniform separation within HA, rather than limiting particular relativizing, naturalizing, or algebrizing techniques.</description>

      <title>Realization of relational presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relational presheaves generalize traditional presheaves by going to the category of sets and relations (as opposed to sets and functions) and by allowing functors which are lax. This added generality is useful because it intuitively allows one to encode situations where we have representables without boundaries or with multiple boundaries at once. In particular, the relational generalization of precubical sets has natural application to modeling concurrency. In this article, we study categories of relational presheaves, and construct realization functors for those. We begin by observing that they form the category of set-based models of a cartesian theory, which implies in particular that they are locally finitely presentable categories. By using general results from categorical logic, we then show that the realization of such presheaves in a cocomplete category is a model of the theory in the opposite category, which allows characterizing situations in which we have a realization functor. Finally, we explain that our work has applications in the semantics of concurrency theory. The realization namely allows one to compare syntactic constructions on relational presheaves and geometric ones. Thanks to it, we are able to provide a syntactic counterpart of the blowup operation, which was recently introduced by Haucourt on directed geometric semantics, as way of turning a directed space into a manifold.</description>

      <title>Interpolation in Knowledge Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Craig interpolation and uniform interpolation have many applications in knowledge representation, including explainability, forgetting, modularization and reuse, and even learning. At the same time, many relevant knowledge representation formalisms do in general not have Craig or uniform interpolation, and computing interpolants in practice is challenging. We have a closer look at two prominent knowledge representation formalisms, description logics and logic programming, and discuss theoretical results and practical methods for computing interpolants.</description>

      <title>On the algorithmic structure of Dialectica realisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation is a fundamental tool for the extraction of computational content from proofs, and plays a central role in today's proof mining program. In the past decades, it has also been studied from the perspective of programming languages, and our contribution is in that direction. Specifically, we present Dialectica as a collection of rules in the style of Hoare logic, where Dialectica is now viewed as a language for specifying procedural programs that come with a forward and backward direction. This viewpoint captures the interesting dynamics of realisers extracted by the Dialectica interpretation, and we illustrate this by defining a generalised backpropagation semantics for a fragment of this language. We envisage this work as providing a base for several future developments, both theoretical and practical, which we outline at the end.</description>

      <title>The Groupoid-Syntax of Type Theory is a Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categories with families (CwFs) have been used to define the semantics of type theory in type theory. In the setting of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), one of the limitations of the traditional notion of CwFs is the requirement to set-truncate types, which excludes models based on univalent categories, such as the standard set model. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of a Groupoid Category with Families (GCwF). This framework truncates types at the groupoid level and incorporates coherence equations, providing a natural extension of the CwF framework when starting from a 1-category.
  We demonstrate that the initial GCwF for a type theory with a base family of sets and Pi-types (groupoid-syntax) is set-truncated. Consequently, this allows us to utilize the conventional intrinsic syntax of type theory while enabling interpretations in semantically richer and more natural models. All constructions in this paper were formalised in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Global Optimization: From Theory to Formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an abstract measure___theoretic framework that serves as a tool to rigorously study stochastic iterative global optimization algorithms as a unified class. The framework is formulated in terms of probability kernels, which, via the Ionescu--Tulcea theorem, induce probability measures on the space of sequences of algorithm iterations, endowed with two intuitive properties. This framework answers the need for a general, implementation___independent formalism in the analysis of such algorithms, providing a starting point for formalizing general results in proof-assistants. To illustrate the relevance of our tool, we show that common algorithms fit naturally in the framework, and we also use it to give a rigorous proof of a general consistency theorem for stochastic iterative global optimization algorithms (Proposition 3 of (Malherbe, et al., 2017). This proof and the entire framework are formalized in the Lean proof assistant. This formalization both ensures the correctness of the definitions and proofs, and provides a basis for future machine-assisted formalizations in the field.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive formalization in the Lean4 theorem prover of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, which characterizes regular local rings as those Noetherian local rings with finite global dimension. Rather than following the well-known proof that computes the projective dimension of the residue field via quotient by regular sequences and uses the Koszul complex to bound the cotangent space dimension by the global dimension, our approach is built systematically on the formalization of depth defined via the vanishing of Ext functors. We establish key homological results including Rees' theorem, the Auslander--Buchsbaum formula, and Ischebeck's theorem, and further develop the theories of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, including a complete formalization of the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings. To prove the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, we show that maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over regular local rings are free and establish a weakened form of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem specific for the unique maximal ideal. As corollaries, we deduce that regularity can be checked at maximal ideals and formalize Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem. This work demonstrates how homological algebra can be effectively employed in the formalization of commutative algebra, providing extensive infrastructure for future developments in the field.</description>
