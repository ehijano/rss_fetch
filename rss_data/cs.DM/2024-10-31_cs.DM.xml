      <title>Elementary methods for splitting representations of Rook monoids: a gentle introduction to groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the algebra of the coloured rook monoid $R_n^{(r)}$, {\em i.e.} the monoid of $n \times n$ matrices with at most one non-zero entry (an $r$-th root of unity) in each column and row, is the algebra of a finite groupoid, thus is endowed with a $C^*$-algebra structure.  This new perspective uncovers the representation theory of these monoid algebras by making manifest their decomposition in irreducible modules.</description>

      <title>Clustering Coefficient Reflecting Pairwise Relationships within Hyperedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are generalizations of simple graphs that allow for the representation of complex group interactions beyond pairwise relationships. Clustering coefficients, which quantify the local link density in networks, have been widely studied even for hypergraphs. However, existing definitions of clustering coefficients for hypergraphs do not fully capture the pairwise relationships within hyperedges. In this study, we propose a novel clustering coefficient for hypergraphs that addresses this limitation by transforming the hypergraph into a weighted graph and calculating the clustering coefficient on the resulting graph. Our definition reflects the local link density more accurately than existing definitions. We demonstrate through theoretical evaluation on higher-order motifs that the proposed definition is consistent with the clustering coefficient for simple graphs and effectively captures relationships within hyperedges missed by existing definitions. Empirical evaluation on real-world hypergraph datasets shows that our definition exhibits similar overall clustering tendencies as existing definitions while providing more precise measurements, especially for hypergraphs with larger hyperedges. The proposed clustering coefficient has the potential to reveal structural characteristics in complex hypergraphs that are not detected by existing definitions, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying interaction patterns in complex hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give inductive sum formulas to calculate the number of diagonally symmetric, and diagonally \&amp; anti-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of Aztec Diamonds. As a byproduct, we also find such a formula for the unrestricted case as well. Our proofs rely on a new technique for counting the number of perfect matchings of graphs, proposed by the authors recently.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Reactivity, Contraction and Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the concept of reactivity for a nonlinear discrete-time system and generalizes this concept to the case of the p-iteration system, p &gt; 1. We introduce a definition of reactivity for nonlinear discrete-time systems based on a general weighted norm. Stability conditions of the first iteration system based on the reactivity of p-iteration system, p &gt; 1 are provided for both linear-time varying systems and nonlinear maps. We provide examples of stability analysis of linear time-varying, and synchronization of chaotic maps using reactivity. We discuss the connection between reactivity and well-established stability criteria, contraction, and finite-time Lyapunov exponents. For the case of a linearized system about a given trajectory and the study of the local stability of the synchronous solution for networks of coupled maps, the reactivity of the p-iteration system coincides with the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, with this time being equal to p. In the limit of infinite p, the reactivity becomes the maximum Lyapunov exponent, which allows us to bridge the gap between the master stability function approach and the contraction theory approach to study the stability of the synchronous solution for networks.</description>

      <title>Flipping Non-Crossing Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a set $P$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane, the flip graph $F(P)$ has a vertex for each non-crossing spanning tree on $P$ and an edge between any two spanning trees that can be transformed into each other by one edge flip. The diameter ${\rm diam}(F(P))$ of this graph is subject of intensive study. For points in general position, it is between $3n/2-5$ and $2n-4$, with no improvement for 25 years. For points in convex position, it lies between $3n/2 - 5$ and $\approx1.95n$, where the lower bound was conjectured to be tight up to an additive constant and the upper bound is a recent breakthrough improvement over several bounds of the form $2n-o(n)$.
  In this work, we provide new upper and lower bounds on ${\rm diam}(F(P))$, mainly focusing on points in convex position. We show $14n/9 - O(1) \le {\rm diam}(F(P)) \le 5n/3 - 3$, by this disproving the conjectured upper bound of $3n/2$ for convex position, and relevantly improving both the long-standing lower bound for general position and the recent new upper bound for convex position. We complement these by showing that if one of $T,T'$ has at most two boundary edges, then ${\rm dist}(T,T') \le 2d/2 &lt; 3n/2$, where $d = |T-T'|$ is the number of edges in one tree that are not in the other.
  To prove both the upper and the lower bound, we introduce a new powerful tool. Specifically, we convert the flip distance problem for given $T,T'$ to the problem of a largest acyclic subset in an associated conflict graph $H(T,T')$. In fact, this method is powerful enough to give an equivalent formulation of the diameter of $F(P)$ for points $P$ in convex position up to lower-order terms. As such, conflict graphs are likely the key to a complete resolution of this and possibly also other reconfiguration problems.</description>

      <title>Feedback Vertex Set for pseudo-disk graphs in subexponential FPT time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of parameterized algorithms running in subexponential time for two fundamental cycle-hitting problems: Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) and Triangle Hitting (TH). We focus on the class of pseudo-disk graphs, which forms a common generalization of several graph classes where such results exist, like disk graphs and square graphs. In these graphs, we show that TH can be solved in time $2^{O(k^{3/4}\log k)}n^{O(1)}$, and given a geometric representation FVS can be solved in time $2^{O(k^{6/7}\log k)}n^{O(1)}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Discrepancy of Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic discrepancy of $m \times m$ matrices $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ belonging to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, which is a class of random symmetric matrices with independent normally distributed entries. In the setting $m^2 = o(n)$, our results show that there exists a signing $x \in \{\pm1\}^n$ such that the spectral norm of $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{nm}4^{-(1 + o(1))n/m^2})$ with high probability. This is best possible and settles a recent conjecture by Kunisky and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Sparse Approximation in Lattices and Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an integer or a non-negative integer solution $x$ to a system $Ax = b$, where the number of non-zero components of $x$ is at most $n$. This paper addresses the following question: How closely can we approximate $b$ with $Ay$, where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution constrained to have at most $k$ non-zero components with $k&lt;n$? We establish upper and lower bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds match. The key finding is that the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$.</description>

      <title>Flip Dynamics for Sampling Colorings: Improving $(11/6-\epsilon)$ Using a Simple Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present improved bounds for randomly sampling $k$-colorings of graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$; our results hold without any further assumptions on the graph. The Glauber dynamics is a simple single-site update Markov chain. Jerrum (1995) proved an optimal $O(n\log{n})$ mixing time bound for Glauber dynamics whenever $k&gt;2\Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. This bound was improved by Vigoda (1999) to $k &gt; (11/6)\Delta$ using a "flip" dynamics which recolors (small) maximal 2-colored components in each step. Vigoda's result was the best known for general graphs for 20 years until Chen et al. (2019) established optimal mixing of the flip dynamics for $k &gt; (11/6 - \epsilon ) \Delta$ where $\epsilon \approx 10^{-5}$. We present the first substantial improvement over these results. We prove an optimal mixing time bound of $O(n\log{n})$ for the flip dynamics when $k \geq 1.809 \Delta$. This yields, through recent spectral independence results, an optimal $O(n\log{n})$ mixing time for the Glauber dynamics for the same range of $k/\Delta$ when $\Delta=O(1)$. Our proof utilizes path coupling with a simple weighted Hamming distance for "unblocked" neighbors.</description>

      <title>The periodic structure of local consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect the mixing behaviour of random walks over a graph to the power of the local-consistency algorithm for the solution of the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). We extend this connection to arbitrary CSPs and their promise variant. In this way, we establish a linear-level (and, thus, optimal) lower bound against the local-consistency algorithm applied to the class of aperiodic promise CSPs. The proof is based on a combination of the probabilistic method for random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi hypergraphs and a structural result on the number of fibers (i.e., long chains of hyperedges) in sparse hypergraphs of large girth. As a corollary, we completely classify the power of local consistency for the approximate graph homomorphism problem by establishing that, in the nontrivial cases, the problem has linear width.</description>

      <title>MILP-StuDio: MILP Instance Generation via Block Structure Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the most popular mathematical formulations with numerous applications. In practice, improving the performance of MILP solvers often requires a large amount of high-quality data, which can be challenging to collect. Researchers thus turn to generation techniques to generate additional MILP instances. However, existing approaches do not take into account specific block structures -- which are closely related to the problem formulations -- in the constraint coefficient matrices (CCMs) of MILPs. Consequently, they are prone to generate computationally trivial or infeasible instances due to the disruptions of block structures and thus problem formulations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MILP generation framework, called Block Structure Decomposition (MILP-StuDio), to generate high-quality instances by preserving the block structures. Specifically, MILP-StuDio begins by identifying the blocks in CCMs and decomposing the instances into block units, which serve as the building blocks of MILP instances. We then design three operators to construct new instances by removing, substituting, and appending block units in the original instances, enabling us to generate instances with flexible sizes. An appealing feature of MILP-StuDio is its strong ability to preserve the feasibility and computational hardness of the generated instances. Experiments on the commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate that using instances generated by MILP-StuDio is able to significantly reduce over 10% of the solving time for learning-based solvers.</description>
