      <title>Practical aspects of transverse resonance island buckets at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring: design, control and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an accelerator, the nonlinear behavior near a horizontal resonance line ($n\nu_x$) usually involves the appearance of stable fixed points (SFPs) in the horizontal phase space, also referred to as transverse resonance island ``buckets" (TRIBs). Specific conditions are required for TRIBs formation. At the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, a new method is developed to improve the dynamic and momentum apertures in a 6-GeV lattice as well as to preserve the conditions for TRIBs formation. This method reduces the dimension of variables from 76 sextupoles to 8 group variables and then utilizes the robust conjugate direction search algorithm in optimization. Created with a few harmonic sextupoles or octupoles, several knobs that can either rotate the TRIBs in phase space or adjust the actions of SFPs are discussed and demonstrated by both tracking simulations and experimental results. In addition, a new scheme to drive all particles into one single island is described. Possible applications using TRIBs in accelerators are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Positron Channeling in Quasi-Mosaic Bent Crystals: Atomistic Simulations vs. Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports on a comprehensive study of an ultra-relativistic positron beam deflection by an oriented quasi-mosaic crystal. The analysis was carried out for the positron energy of 530 MeV incident on the quasi-mosaic bent Si(111) crystal. This particular case was chosen because it has recently been studied experimentally at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The results of the relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were compared with the experimental observations and a good agreement was found. The presence of planar channeling, de-channeling, volume reflection and volume capture processes in the angular distribution of deflected positrons for different beam-crystal alignments has been studied. Predictions have been made for certain crystal orientations for which experimental data are lacking.</description>

      <title>DA{\Phi}NE -2023/24 Activity report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DA{\Phi}NE operations during the last year have been devoted to deliver a statistically significant data sample to perform the first-ever measurement of kaonic deuterium X-ray transitions to the fundamental level. Operations for the SIDDHARTA-2 detector using a deuterium gas target started officially on the second half of May 2023, and have been organized in several runs here described.</description>
