      <title>Average Categorical Symmetries in One-Dimensional Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional disordered systems with average non-invertible symmetries, where quenched disorder may locally break part of the symmetry while preserving it upon disorder averaging. A canonical example is the random transverse-field Ising model, which at criticality exhibits an average Kramers-Wannier duality. We consider the general setting in which the full symmetry is described by a $G$-graded fusion category $\mathcal{B}$, whose identity component $\mathcal{A}$ remains exact, while the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized either exactly or only on average. We develop a topological holographic framework that encodes the symmetry data of the 1D system in a 2D topological order $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ (the Drinfeld center of $\mathcal{A}$), enriched by an exact or, respectively, average $G$ symmetry. Within this framework, we obtain a complete classification of anomalies and average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases: when the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized only on average, the symmetry is anomaly-free if and only if $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra that is invariant under the permutation action of $G$ on anyons. When an anomaly is present, we show that the ground state of a single disorder realization is long-range entangled with probability one in the thermodynamic limit, and is expected to exhibit power-law Griffiths singularities in the low-energy spectrum. Finally, we present an explicit, exactly solvable lattice model based on a symmetry-enriched string-net construction. It yields trivial ground state ensemble in the anomaly-free case, and exhibits exotic low-energy behavior in the presence of an average anomaly.</description>

      <title>Finite integration time can shift optimal sensitivity away from criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitivity to small changes in the environment is crucial for many real-world tasks, enabling living and artificial systems to make correct behavioral decisions. It has been shown that such sensitivity is maximized when a system operates near the critical point of a phase transition. However, proximity to criticality introduces large fluctuations and diverging timescales. Hence, to leverage the maximal sensitivity, it would require impractically long integration periods. Here, we analytically and computationally demonstrate how the optimal tuning of a recurrent neural network is determined given a finite integration time. Rather than maximizing the theoretically available sensitivity, we find networks attain different sensitivities depending on the available time. Consequently, the optimal dynamic regime can shift away from criticality when integration times are finite, highlighting the necessity of incorporating finite-time considerations into studies of information processing.</description>

      <title>Early warning signals for phase transitions in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The percolation phase transition in complex network systems attracts much attention and has numerous applications in various research fields. Finite size effects smooth the transition and make it difficult to predict the critical point of appearance or disappearance of the giant connected component. For this end, we introduce the susceptibility of arbitrary random undirected and directed networks and show that a strong increase of the susceptibility is the early warning signal of approaching the transition point. Our method is based on the introduction of `observers', which are randomly chosen nodes monitoring the local connectivity of a network. To demonstrate efficiency of the method, we derive explicit equations determining the susceptibility and study its critical behavior near continuous and mixed-order phase transitions in uncorrelated random undirected and directed networks, networks with dependency links, and $k$-cores of networks. The universality of the critical behavior is supported by the phenomenological Landau theory of phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum annealing leverages the properties of interacting quantum spin systems to solve computational problems, typically optimisation problems. Current hardware now has capabilities that can be used to solve condensed matter physics problems, too. In this topical review, we provide an overview of quantum annealing aimed at condensed matter physicists, to show the mutual benefits of working together to understand and improve how quantum annealers work, and to use them to advance condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>

      <title>Logarithmically slow heat propagation in a clean Josephson-junction chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a clean Josephson-junction chain coupled by one of its extremities to a thermal bath through a resistance. Considering the Langevin dynamics in the classical regime, in the case of Josephson energy much smaller than charging energy, we find that heat propagates logarithmically slowly through the system, rather than diffusively, as highlighted by the logarithmic increase in time of a thermalization length we define and by the logarithmically slow increase in time of the energy. This behavior -- typical of quantum Anderson or many-body localized systems -- is observed here also in a clean classical glassy Hamiltonian system. We argue that this phenomenon might imply strong robustness to the effect of ergodic inclusions for the nonergodic behavior in the charge-quantized regime.</description>

      <title>Simulating superconductivity in mixed-dimensional $t_\parallel$-${J}_\parallel$-${J}_\perp$ bilayers with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Canonical partition function and distance dependent correlation functions of a quasi-one-dimensional system of hard disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The canonical NLT partition function of a quasi-one dimensional (q1D) one-file system of equal hard disks [J. Chem Phys. 153, 144111 (2020)] provides an analytical description of the thermodynamics and ordering in this system (a pore) as a function of linear density Nd/L where d is the disk diameter. We derive the analytical formulae for the distance dependence of the translational pair distribution function and the distribution function of distances between next neighbor disks, and then demonstrate their use by calculating the translational order in the pore. In all cases, the order is found to be of a short range and to exponentially decay with the disks' separation. The correlation length presented for different pore widths and densities shows a non-monotonic dependence with a maximum at Nd/L=1 and tends to the 1D value for a vanishing pore width. The results indicate a special role of this density when the pore length L is equal exactly to N disk diameters. A comparison between the theoretical results for an infinite system and the results of a molecular dynamics simulation for a finite system with periodic boundary conditions is presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. In this letter, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQSs) are powerful variational ans\"atze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQSs such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.</description>

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto standard for conditional sampling in diffusion models, yet it often leads to a loss of diversity in generated samples. We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.</description>
