      <title>Unifying Lyapunov exponents with probabilistic uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lyaponuv exponent is well-known in deterministic dynamical systems as a measure for quantifying chaos and detecting coherent regions in physically evolving systems. In this Letter, we show how the Lyapunov exponent can be unified with stochastic sensitivity (which quantifies the uncertainty of an evolving uncertain system whose initial condition is certain) within a finite time uncertainty quantification framework in which both the dynamics and the initial condition of a continuously evolving $ n $-dimensional state variable are uncertain.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning to Separate Cherenkov and Scintillation Light in Hybrid Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the separation of Cherenkov and Scintillation light signals within a simulated Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector, utilizing the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. The simulation data were gathered using the Rat-Pac software, which was built on the Geant4 architecture. The use of the WbLS medium has the capability to generate both Scintillation and Cherenkov light inside a single detector. To show the separation power of these two physics events, we will use the supervised learning approach. The assessment utilized a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve, with the ROC curve indicating a performance result of $0.96 \pm 1.2\times 10^{-4}$. The research also aimed to identify essential parameters for effectively distinguishing these physics events through machine learning. For this, the study also introduced the SHAP methodology, utilizing game theory to assess feature contributions. The findings demonstrated that the number of hits has a significant effect on the trained model, while the mean hit time has a somewhat smaller impact. This research advances the utilization of AI and simulation data for accurate Cherenkov and Scintillation light separation in neutrino detectors</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Timescales of a Complex System: A Bayesian Approach to Temporal Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in the timescales at which complex systems evolve are essential to predicting critical transitions and catastrophic failures. Disentangling the timescales of the dynamics governing complex systems remains a key challenge. With this study, we introduce an integrated Bayesian framework based on temporal network models to address this challenge. We focus on two methodologies: change point detection for identifying shifts in system dynamics, and a spectrum analysis for inferring the distribution of timescales. Applied to synthetic and empirical datasets, these methologies robustly identify critical transitions and comprehensively map the dominant and subsidiaries timescales in complex systems. This dual approach offers a powerful tool for analyzing temporal networks, significantly enhancing our understanding of dynamic behaviors in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Improved particle-flow event reconstruction with scalable neural networks for current and future particle detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06782v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithms are necessary to reconstruct particles in the highly granular detectors anticipated at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and the Future Circular Collider. We study scalable machine learning models for event reconstruction in electron-positron collisions based on a full detector simulation. Particle-flow reconstruction can be formulated as a supervised learning task using tracks and calorimeter clusters. We compare a graph neural network and kernel-based transformer and demonstrate that we can avoid quadratic operations while achieving realistic reconstruction. We show that hyperparameter tuning significantly improves the performance of the models. The best graph neural network model shows improvement in the jet transverse momentum resolution by up to 50% compared to the rule-based algorithm. The resulting model is portable across Nvidia, AMD and Habana hardware. Accurate and fast machine-learning based reconstruction can significantly improve future measurements at colliders.</description>

      <title>Does Lorentz-symmetric design boost network performance in jet physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the deep learning era, improving the neural network performance in jet physics is a rewarding task as it directly contributes to more accurate physics measurements at the LHC. Recent research has proposed various network designs in consideration of the full Lorentz symmetry, but its benefit is still not systematically asserted, given that there remain many successful networks without taking it into account. We conduct a detailed study on the Lorentz-symmetric design. We propose two generalized approaches for modifying a network - these methods are experimented on Particle Flow Network, ParticleNet, and LorentzNet, and exhibit a general performance gain. We also reveal that the notable improvement attributed to the "pairwise mass" feature in the network is due to its introduction of a structure that fully complies with Lorentz symmetry. We confirm that Lorentz-symmetry preservation serves as a strong inductive bias of jet physics, hence calling for attention to such general recipes in future network designs.</description>

      <title>First-principles construction of symmetry-informed quantum metrologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but exact solutions are often hard to find. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of exactly solvable optimisation equations. For any quantity isomorphic to a location parameter, rules to devise optimal measurements are given in closed form. These are valid for any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. This framework unifies the metrology of locations, scales, and other parameter types such as relative weights, for which hyperbolic errors are required. But the central advantage lies on its simplifying power: searching for good strategies amounts to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant, irrespective of error bounds. This reduces the number of calculations needed in practice and enables the rigorous application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>
