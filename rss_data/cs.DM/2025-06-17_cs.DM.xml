      <title>Stereotype graph: A mathematical framework of category stereotypes via graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social psychology and cognitive science, there has been much interest in studying category stereotypes. However, we still lack a consensual mathematical definition or framework, which is necessary for us to hold a deeper understanding of stereotypes in human cognition. In this paper, we use graph theory to portray category stereotypes in human cognition, based on pairs of labels having special relations. By using methods and conclusions in graph theory (including algebraic graph theory and vertex coloring) as well as strict ratiocination, we give criteria for judging the stability of a given stereotype, some of which are computationally practicable. We also define the chromatic stability index (CSI) to measure the stability of a stereotype in human cognition, as well as to provide its precise range. From the perspective of stereotype graphs and CSI, we may explain why stereotypes can easily stay in human cognition.</description>

      <title>Shortest Paths in a Weighted Simplicial Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes are extensively studied in the field of algebraic topology. They have gained attention in recent time due to their applications in fields like theoretical distributed computing and simplicial neural networks. Graphs are mono-dimensional simplicial complex. Graph theory has application in topics like theoretical computer science, operations research, bioinformatics and social sciences. This makes it natural to try to adapt graph-theoretic results for simplicial complexes, which can model more intricate and detailed structures appearing in real-world systems. In this article, we define the concept of weighted simplicial complex and $d$-path in a simplicial complex. Both these concepts have the potential to have numerous real-life applications. Next, we provide a novel algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted simplicial complex. The core principles of our algorithm align with those of Dijkstra$^\prime$s algorithm for graphs. Hence, this work lays another brick for the sake of integrating graph-theoretic concepts with abstract simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>The Combinatorial Rank of Subsets: Metric Density in Finite Hamming Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of rank for subsets of finite metric spaces E^n_q (the set of all n-dimensional vectors over an alphabet of size q) equipped with the Hamming distance, where the rank R(A) of a subset A is defined as the number of non-constant columns in the matrix formed by the vectors of A. This purely combinatorial definition provides a new perspective on the structure of finite metric spaces, distinct from traditional linear-algebraic notions of rank. We establish tight bounds for R(A) in terms of D_A, the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of elements in A. Specifically, we prove that 2qD_A/((q-1)|A|^2) &lt;= R(A) &lt;= D_A/(|A|-1) when |A|/q &gt;= 1, with a modified lower bound for the case |A|/q &lt; 1. These bounds show that the rank is constrained by the metric properties of the subset. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of metrically dense subsets, which are subsets that minimize rank among all isometric images. This notion captures an extremal property of subsets that represent their distance structure in the most compact way possible. We prove that subsets with uniform column distribution are metrically dense, and as a special case, establish that when q is a prime power, every linear subspace of E^n_q is metrically dense. This reveals a fundamental connection between the algebraic and metric structures of these spaces.</description>

      <title>Interacting Geodesics on Discrete Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an evolution of multiple particles on a discrete manifold $G$. Each particle alone moves on geodesics and particles can interact if they are on the same facet. They move deterministically and reversibly on the frame bundle $P$ of the abstract simplicial complex $G$. Particles are signed and each is represented by a totally ordered maximal simplex $p \in P$ in $G$. The motion of divisors on $P$ also defines a time dependent reversible deformation of space.</description>

      <title>Approximate polymorphisms of predicates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized polymorphism of a predicate $P \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$ is a tuple of functions $f_1,\dots,f_m\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ satisfying the following property: If $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)} \in \{0,1\}^n$ are such that $(x^{(1)}_i,\dots,x^{(m)}_i) \in P$ for all $i$, then also $(f_1(x^{(1)}),\dots,f_m(x^{(m)})) \in P$.
  We show that if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ satisfy this property for most $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)}$ (as measured with respect to an arbitrary full support distribution $\mu$ on $P$), then $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are close to a generalized polymorphism of $P$ (with respect to the marginals of $\mu$).
  Our main result generalizes several results in the literature: linearity testing, quantitative Arrow theorems, approximate intersecting families, AND testing, and more generally $f$-testing.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound on Howard Policy Iteration for Deterministic Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs) are a mathematical framework for decision-making where the outcomes and future possible actions are deterministically determined by the current action taken. DMDPs can be viewed as a finite directed weighted graph, where in each step, the controller chooses an outgoing edge. An objective is a measurable function on runs (or infinite trajectories) of the DMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal cumulative reward (or weight) that the controller can guarantee. We consider the classical mean-payoff (aka limit-average) objective, which is a basic and fundamental objective.
  Howard's policy iteration algorithm is a popular method for solving DMDPs with mean-payoff objectives. Although Howard's algorithm performs well in practice, as experimental studies suggested, the best known upper bound is exponential and the current known lower bound is as follows: For the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{I})$ iterations, where $\tilde{\Omega}$ hides the poly-logarithmic factors, i.e., the current lower bound on iterations is sub-linear with respect to the input size. Our main result is an improved lower bound for this fundamental algorithm where we show that for the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(I)$ iterations.</description>

      <title>A Compendium of Subset Search Problems and Reductions relating to the Parsimonious Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis centers around the concept of Subset Search Problems (SSP), a type of computational problem introduced by Gr\"une and Wulf to analyze the complexity of more intricate optimization problems. These problems are given an input set, a so-called universe, and their solution lies within their own universe, e.g. the shortest path between two point is a subset of all possible paths. Due to this, reductions upholding the SSP property require an injective embedding from the universe of the first problem into that of the second. This, however, appears inherently similar to the concept of a Parsimonious reduction, a reduction type requiring a bijective function between the solution spaces of the two problems. Parsimonious reductions are mainly used within the complexity class #P, as this class of problems concerns itself with the number of possible solutions in a given problem. These two concepts, SSP and Parsimonious reductions, are inherently similar but, crucially, not equivalent. We therefore explore the interplay between reductions upholding the SSP and Parsimonious properties, highlighting both the similarities and differences by providing a comprehensive theorem delineating the properties required for reductions to uphold both attributes. We also compile and evaluate 46 reductions between 30 subset search variants of computational problems, including those of classic NP-complete problems such as Satisfiability, Vertex Cover, Hamiltonian Cycle, the Traveling Salesman Problem and Subset Sum, providing reduction proofs, illustrative examples and insights as to where the SSP and Parsimonious properties coexist or diverge. With this compendium we contribute to the understanding of the computational complexity of bilevel and robust optimization problems, by contributing a vast collection of proven SSP- and #P-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Layered tree-independence number and clique-based separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Galby, Munaro, and Yang (SoCG 2023) asking whether every graph class of bounded layered tree-independence number admits clique-based separators of sublinear weight, we investigate relations between layered tree-independence number, weight of clique-based separators, clique cover degeneracy and independence degeneracy. In particular, we provide a number of results bounding these parameters on geometric intersection graphs. For example, we show that the layered tree-independence number is $\mathcal{O}(g)$ for $g$-map graphs, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{r}{\tanh r})$ for hyperbolic uniform disk graphs with radius $r$, and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for spherical uniform disk graphs with radius $r$. Our structural results have algorithmic consequences. In particular, we obtain a number of subexponential or quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for weighted problems such as \textsc{Max Weight Independent Set} and \textsc{Min Weight Feedback Vertex Set} on several geometric intersection graphs. Finally, we conjecture that every fractionally tree-independence-number-fragile graph class has bounded independence degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Circular Directional Flow Decomposition of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Circular Directional Flow Decomposition (CDFD), a new framework for analyzing circularity in weighted directed networks. CDFD separates flow into two components: a circular (divergence-free) component and an acyclic component that carries all nett directional flow. This yields a normalized circularity index between 0 (fully acyclic) and 1 (for networks formed solely by the superposition of cycles), with the complement measuring directionality. This index captures the proportion of flow involved in cycles, and admits a range of interpretations - such as system closure, feedback, weighted strong connectivity, structural redundancy, or inefficiency. Although the decomposition is generally non-unique, we show that the set of all decompositions forms a well-structured geometric space with favourable topological properties. Within this space, we highlight two benchmark decompositions aligned with distinct analytical goals: the maximum circularity solution, which minimizes nett flow, and the Balanced Flow Forwarding (BFF) solution, a unique, locally computable decomposition that distributes circular flow across all feasible cycles in proportion to the original network structure. We demonstrate the interpretive value and computational tractability of both decompositions on synthetic and empirical networks. They outperform existing circularity metrics in detecting meaningful structural variation. The decomposition also enables structural analysis - such as mapping the distribution of cyclic flow - and supports practical applications that require explicit flow allocation or routing, including multilateral netting and efficient transport.</description>

      <title>On the Vertices of Delta-modular Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a polytope defined by the system $A x \leq b$, where $A \in R^{m \times n}$, $b \in R^m$, and $\text{rank}(A) = n$. We give a short geometric proof of the following tight upper bound on the number of vertices of $P$: $$
  n! \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}} \cdot \text{vol}(B_2) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n}} \cdot \left(\frac{2 \pi}{e}\right)^{n/2} \cdot n^{n/2} \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}, $$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $n \times n$ subdeterminants of $A$, and $\Delta_{\text{average}}$ is the average absolute value of subdeterminants of $A$ corresponding to a triangulation of $P$'s normal fan. Assuming that $A$ is integer, such polyhedra are called $\Delta$-modular polyhedra. Note that in the integer case, the bound can be simplified via the inequality $\Delta_{\text{average}} \geq \Delta_{\min} \geq 1$, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the minimum absolute value of subdeterminants of $A$ corresponding to feasible bases of $A x \leq b$. For this, we prove and use a symmetric variant of Macbeath's theorem.
  Additionally, we give a direct argument based on prior results in the field, showing that the graph diameter of $P$ is bounded by $O\bigl(n^3 \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\min}} \cdot \ln (n \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\min}}) \bigr)$. Thus, both characteristic of $P$ are linear in $\Delta/\Delta_{\min}$.
  From an algorithmic perspective, we demonstrate that:
  Given $A \in Q^{m \times n}$, $b \in Q^m$, and an initial feasible solution to $A x \leq b$, the convex hull of $P$ can be constructed in $O(n)^{n/2} \cdot m^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}$ operations. For simple polyhedra, the dependence on $m$ reduces to linear;
  Given $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ and $b \in Q^m$, the number $|P \cap Z^n|$ can be computed in $O(n)^n \cdot \frac{\Delta^4}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}$ arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Locating-dominating partitions for some classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $D \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G) \setminus D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. A set $L\subseteq V(G)$ is a locating set of $G$ if every vertex in $V(G) \setminus L$ has pairwise distinct open neighborhoods in $L$. A set $D\subseteq V(G)$ is a locating-dominating set of $G$ if $D$ is a dominating set and a locating set of $G$. The location-domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{LD}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality among all locating-dominating sets of $G$. A well-known conjecture in the study of locating-dominating sets is that if $G$ is an isolate-free and twin-free graph of order $n$, then $\gamma_{LD}(G)\le \frac{n}{2}$. Recently, Bousquet et al. [Discrete Math. 348 (2025), 114297] proved that if $G$ is an isolate-free and twin-free graph of order $n$, then $\gamma_{LD}(G)\le \lceil\frac{5n}{8}\rceil$ and posed the question whether the vertex set of such a graph can be partitioned into two locating sets. We answer this question affirmatively for twin-free distance-hereditary graphs, maximal outerplanar graphs, split graphs, and co-bipartite graphs. In fact, we prove a stronger result that for any graph $G$ without isolated vertices and twin vertices, if $G$ is a distance-hereditary graph or a maximal outerplanar graph or a split graph or a co-bipartite graph, then the vertex set of $G$ can be partitioned into two locating-dominating sets. Consequently, this also confirms the original conjecture for these graph classes.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that for an NFA with $n$ states this length can be at least $2^n - 1$ for an alphabet of size $n$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ for an alphabet of size $3$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ for an alphabet of size $2$. We also discuss further open problems related to mortality of NFAs and DFAs.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Beyond Value Iteration for Parity Games: Strategy Iteration with Universal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13338v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (STOC 2017). The combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi\'nski et al. (SODA 2019). By proving a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of a universal tree, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial running time. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.

As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of 1-player games. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (LICS 2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (ICALP 2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\log n\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\log^3 n \log d)$ respectively per iteration.</description>

      <title>Triangle processes on graphs with given degree sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08499v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The switch chain is a well-studied Markov chain which generates random graphs with a given degree sequence and has uniform stationary distribution. Motivated by the high number of triangles seen in some real-world networks, we study a variant of the switch chain which is more likely to produce graphs with higher numbers of triangles. Specifically, we apply a Metropolis scheme designed to have the following stationary distribution: graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{\min\{t(G),\nu\}}$, where $t(G)$ is the number of triangles in $G$ and $\nu$ is a cut-off value introduced to moderate the impact of graphs with a very high number of triangles. We assume that the "activity" $\lambda$ satisfies $\lambda\geq 1$, and call the resulting chain the modified Metropolis switch chain. We prove that the modified Metropolis switch chain is rapidly mixing whenever the (standard) switch chain is rapidly mixing, provided that the activity and maximum degree are not too large.
  The triangle switch (or "$\triangle$-switch") chain is a restriction of the switch chain which only performs switches that change the set of triangles in the graph. We prove that the $\triangle$-switch chain is irreducible for any degree sequence with minimum degree at least 3, and prove a rapid mixing result for the modified Metropolis $\triangle$-switch chain.
  Finally, we investigate the distribution of triangles in random graphs with given degrees, under both the uniform distribution and the distribution in which graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{t(G)}$. Our analysis implies that the imposition of the cut-off $\nu$ does not significantly impact the behaviour of these modified Metropolis chains over polynomially many steps</description>

      <title>Complexity of Injectivity and Verification of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activation play a key role in modern machine learning. Understanding the functions represented by ReLU networks is a major topic in current research as this enables a better interpretability of learning processes. Injectivity of a function computed by a ReLU network, that is, the question if different inputs to the network always lead to different outputs, plays a crucial role whenever invertibility of the function is required, such as, e.g., for inverse problems or generative models. The exact computational complexity of deciding injectivity was recently posed as an open problem (Puthawala et al. [JMLR 2022]). We answer this question by proving coNP-completeness. On the positive side, we show that the problem for a single ReLU-layer is still tractable for small input dimension; more precisely, we present a parameterized algorithm which yields fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the input dimension. In addition, we study the network verification problem which is to verify that certain inputs only yield specific outputs. This is of great importance since neural networks are increasingly used in safety-critical systems. We prove that network verification is coNP-hard for a general class of input domains. Our results also exclude constant-factor polynomial-time approximations for the maximum of a function computed by a ReLU network. In this context, we also characterize surjectivity of functions computed by ReLU networks with one-dimensional output which turns out to be the complement of a basic network verification task. We reveal interesting connections to computational convexity by formulating the surjectivity problem as a zonotope containment problem</description>

      <title>Sparse Sets in Triangle-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of vertices is $k$-sparse if it induces a graph with a maximum degree of at most $k$. In this missive, we consider the order of the largest $k$-sparse set in a triangle-free graph of fixed order. We show, for example, that every triangle-free graph of order 11 contains a 1-sparse 5-set; every triangle-free graph of order 13 contains a 2-sparse 7-set; and every triangle-free graph of order 8 contains a 3-sparse 6-set. Further, these are all best possible.
  For fixed $k$, we consider the growth rate of the largest $k$-sparse set of a triangle-free graph of order $n$. Also, we consider Ramsey numbers of the following type. Given $i$, what is the smallest $n$ having the property that all triangle-free graphs of order $n$ contain a 4-cycle or a $k$-sparse set of order $i$. We use both direct proof techniques and an efficient graph enumeration algorithm to obtain several values for defective Ramsey numbers and a parameter related to largest sparse sets in triangle-free graphs, along with their extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm can be found at https://codeberg.org/zsamboki/dbs-udg.</description>

      <title>$\chi$-Boundedness and Neighbourhood Complexity of Bounded Merge-Width Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merge-width, recently introduced by Dreier and Toru\'nczyk, is a common generalisation of bounded expansion classes and twin-width for which the first-order model checking problem remains tractable. We prove that a number of basic properties shared by bounded expansion and bounded twin-width graphs also hold for bounded merge-width graphs: they are $\chi$-bounded, they satisfy the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property, and their neighbourhood complexity is linear.</description>
