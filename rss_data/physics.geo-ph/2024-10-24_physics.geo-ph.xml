      <title>GPU Accelerated 3D P-wave Source Free Adaptive Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion with an application to experimental VSP physical modeling data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) has been considered a potential solution to the issue of local minima inherent in conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) methods. However, most current WRI research has been confined to 2D problems due to the computational challenges posed by solving augmented systems for optimal data-fitting wavefields. This constraint limits WRI applicability to realistic 3D scenarios. This study introduces a GPU-accelerated 3D source-free adaptive WRI (GPU-SF-AWRI) method that overcomes these computational barriers by adaptively controlling the computational accuracy of wavefield simulation and optimizing GPU utilization, thus enhancing its suitability for 3D applications. The inclusion of an on-the-fly source estimation technique further boosts its performance on realistic problems. Numerical experiments reveal that the proposed GPU-accelerated method achieves a 195-fold speedup compared to CPU-based approaches. By incorporating adaptive accuracy and total variation regularization, we attain a 2-fold speedup while maintaining inversion accuracy. We applied the GPU-SF-AWRI method to numerical and actual Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) physical modeling P-wave data, confirming its efficacy in addressing real data challenges and mitigating local minima associated with conventional FWI.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Convolutional Filter for Seismic Noise Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic exploration is currently the most mature approach for studying subsurface structures, yet the presence of noise greatly restricts its imaging accuracy. Previous methods still face significant challenges: traditional computational methods are often computationally complex and their effectiveness is hard to guarantee; deep learning approaches rely heavily on datasets, and the complexity of network training makes them difficult to apply in practical field scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a method that has only 2464 learnable parameters, and its parameter constraints rely on priors rather than requiring training data. The three priors we proposed can effectively attenuate random noise while significantly reducing signal leakage, ensuring that the separated noise remains as independent as possible from the processed data. We validated our method on National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Survey, and the results indicate that our proposed approach effectively enhances noise elimination and seismic data resolution.</description>

      <title>Python workflow for segmenting multiphase flow in porous rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray micro-CT) is widely employed to investigate flow phenomena in porous media, providing a powerful alternative to core-scale experiments for estimating traditional petrophysical properties such as porosity, single-phase permeability or fluid connectivity. However, the segmentation process, critical for deriving these properties from greyscale images, varies significantly between studies due to the absence of a standardized workflow or any ground truth data. This introduces challenges in comparing results across different studies, especially for properties sensitive to segmentation. To address this, we present a fully open-source, automated workflow for the segmentation of a Bentheimer sandstone filled with nitrogen and brine. The workflow incorporates a traditional image processing pipeline, including non-local means filtering, image registration, watershed segmentation of grains, and a combination of differential imaging and thresholding for segmentation of the fluid phases. Our workflow enhances reproducibility by enabling other research groups to easily replicate and validate findings, fostering consistency in petrophysical property estimation. Moreover, its modular structure facilitates integration into modeling frameworks, allowing for forward-backward communication and parameter sensitivity analyses. We apply the workflow to exploring the sensitivity of the non-wetting phase volume, surface area, and connectivity to image processing. This adaptable tool paves the way for future advancements in X-ray micro-CT analysis of porous media.</description>

      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>

      <title>Verifying The Radiosonde Humidity Sensor Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the performance of humidity sensors has become particularly relevant due to the lack of in-house production of humidity sensors in the Russian Federation and the logistical problems that have arisen. Humidity is subject to high spatial variability, therefore, standard methods for monitoring data quality based on the difference with the field of the first approximation are not applicable for its control. It is proposed to carry out monitoring by comparing readings on the surface and at altitude with a pressure of 850 hPa, where humidity is less than 60% in the absence of low clouds, and more than 70% in its presence. The fact of the presence/absence of low clouds is determined by the readings of a vertically oriented pyrometer. The difference between the air temperature at the surface and the temperature from the pyrometer of more than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the absence of low clouds, and less than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the presence of low clouds. Accordingly, a serviceable humidity sensor should show the appropriate values.</description>
