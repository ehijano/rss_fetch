      <title>Quasimolecular electronic structure of the trimer iridate Ba$_4$NbIr$_3$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulating mixed-valent Ir$^{+3.66}$ compound Ba$_4$NbIr$_3$O$_{12}$ hosts two holes per Ir$_3$O$_{12}$ trimer unit. We address the electronic structure via resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ir $L_3$ edge and exact diagonalization. The holes occupy quasimolecular orbitals that are delocalized over a trimer. This gives rise to a rich intra-$t_{2g}$ excitation spectrum that extends from 0.5 eV to energies larger than 2 eV. Furthermore, it yields a strong modulation of the RIXS intensity as a function of the transferred momentum q. A clear fingerprint of the quasimolecular trimer character is the observation of two modulation periods, $2\pi/d$ and $2\pi/2d$, where d and 2d denote the intratrimer Ir-Ir distances. We discuss how the specific modulation reflects the character of the wavefunction of an excited state. Our quantitative analysis shows that spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$ of about 0.4 eV is decisive for the character of the electronic states, despite a large hopping $t_{a_{1g}}$ of about 0.8 eV. The ground state of a single trimer is described very well by both holes occupying the bonding j=1/2 orbital, forming a vanishing quasimolecular moment with J=0.</description>

      <title>Spin excitations of the Shastry-Sutherland model -- altermagnetism and proximate deconfined quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In quantum magnetism, it dictates a number of exotic phenomena, including deconfined quantum criticality and altermagnetism. Here, by studying the spin excitations of the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Shastry-Sutherland model, we show that the N\'eel antiferromagnetic state in this model is an altermagnet featuring a non-relativistic splitting between two chiral magnon bands. Moreover, we identify a Higgs mode in the longitudinal excitation channel, whose gap softens when approaching the antiferromagnetic to plaquette valence bond solid transition, implying the appearance of nearly deconfined excitations. However, the splitting between the two magnon bands (Goldstone modes) remains finite at the transition. These results indicate that the transition is weakly first-order and proximate to a putative deconfined quantum critical point. We find that the altermagnetism provides a sensitive means to probe the deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Two plaquette-singlet phases in the Shastry-Sutherland compound SrCu2(BO3)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the high-pressure plaquette-singlet (PS) phase of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ remains enigmatic. In this work, we revisit the high-pressure $^{11}$B NMR study and identify two distinct coexisting gapped PS states within the NMR spectra. In addition to the previously reported full-plaquette phase, a second PS phase is discerned, characterized by a slightly lower resonance frequency and larger spin-lattice relaxation rates in its ordered phase. Notably, this second phase exhibits enhanced spin fluctuations in its precursor liquid state above the transition temperature. The volume fraction of this phase increases significantly with pressure, reaching approximately 70\% at 2.65~GPa. Furthermore, at 2.4~GPa, a field-induced quantum phase transition from the PS phase to an antiferromagnetic phase is observed around 5.5~T, with a scaling behavior of $1/T_1 \sim T^{0.6}$ near the transition field. This behavior suggests a continuous or nearly continuous nature for the field-induced transition. Our findings provide experimental evidence for the long-sought empty-plaquette singlet phase in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ within the framework of the Shastry-Sutherland model, thus establishing a promising platform for future studies of deconfined quantum criticality in this model system.</description>

      <title>Optical absorptions activated by an ultrashort halfcycle pulse in metallic and superconducting states of the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort halfcycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort halfcycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Topological Superstructure of Magnetic Hopfions Threaded by Meron Strings in Easy-plane Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin textures exhibit a hierarchical nature. For instance, magnetic skyrmions, which possess a particle-like nature, can aggregate to form superstructures such as skyrmion strings and skyrmion lattices. Magnetic hopfions are also regarded as superstructures constructed from closed loops of twisted skyrmion strings, which behave as another independent particles. However, it remains elusive whether such magnetic hopfions can also aggregate to form higher-level superstructures. Here, we report a stable superstructure with three-dimensional periodic arrangement of magnetic hopfions in a frustrated spin model with easy-plane anisotropy. By comprehensively examining effective interactions between two hopfions, we construct the hopfion superstructure by a staggered arrangement of one-dimensional hopfion chains with Hopf number $H=+1$ and $H=-1$ running perpendicular to the easy plane. Each hopfion chain is threaded by a magnetic meron string, resulting in a nontrivial topological texture with skyrmion number $N_{\rm sk}=2$ per magnetic unit cell on any two-dimensional cut parallel to the easy plane. We show that the hopfion superstructure remains robust as a metastable state across a range of the hopfion density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that superstructures with higher Hopf number can also be stabilized. Our findings extend the existing hierarchy of topological magnets and pave the way for exploring new quantum phenomena and spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fusing matrix-product states with quantum Monte Carlo: reducing entanglement and sign problem at the same time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of correlated quantum matter can be a steep challenge to any would-be method of solution. Matrix-product state (MPS)-based methods can describe 1D systems quasiexactly, but often struggle to retain sufficient bipartite entanglement to accurately approximate 2D systems already. Conversely, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches, based on sampling a probability distribution, can generally approximate 2D and 3D systems with an error that decays systematically with growing sampling size. However, QMC can suffer from the so-called sign problem, that makes the approach prohibitively costly for many systems of interest, such as repulsively interacting fermions away from commensurate densities and frustrated systems. In this article, we introduce a new hybrid approach, that combines auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC) with MPS-based algorithms. This hybrid technique removes or reduces the sign problem (depending on the specific model) while also needing to retain much lower bipartite entanglement than brute-force application of a MPS-algorithm, without the use of uncontrolled approximations. We present two use-cases of the algorithm that would be challenging or impossible to address with any other approach, and quantify the extent of any remaining sign problem.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane bond order phase, superconductivity, and their competition in the $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model for pressurized nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost four decades of intense research have been invested to study the physics of high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelates and its potential similarities with cuprate superconductors may open a new window to understand this long standing problem. Motivated by this we have assumed that nickelates belong to the category of strongly correlated systems, and considered the bilayer $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model as a minimal model, where $J_\parallel$ and $J_\perp$ are the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic exchange, respectively. We have studied the $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model in a large-$N$ approach on the basis of the path integral representation for Hubbard operators, which allows to obtain results at mean-field and beyond mean-field level. We find that $J_\perp$ is a promising candidate for triggering high superconducting $T_c$ values at quarter filling (hole doping $\delta=0.5$) of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Beyond mean-field level, we remarkably find a new phase, an out-of-plane bond-order phase (z-BOP), triggered also by $J_\perp$. z-BOP develops below a critical temperature which decreases with increasing doping and vanishes at a quantum critical point below quarter filling. The occurrence of this phase and its competition with superconductivity leads to a superconducting dome shaped behavior as a function of doping and as a function of $J_\perp$. Comparisons with the physics of cuprates and the recent literature on the new pressurized nickelates are given along the paper.</description>

      <title>Controlling electronic properties of hexagonal manganites through aliovalent doping and thermoatmospheric history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of hexagonal manganites is intensively studied for its multiferroicity, magnetoelectric coupling, improper ferroelectricity, functional domain walls, and topology-related scaling behaviors. It is established that these physical properties are co-determined by the cation sublattices and that aliovalent doping can readily be leveraged to modify them. The doping, however, also impacts the anion defect chemistry and semiconducting properties, which makes the system highly sensitive to the synthesis and processing conditions. Here, we study the electronic properties of YMnO3 as function of aliovalent cation doping and thermoatmospheric history, combining density functional theory calculations with thermopower and thermogravimetric measurements. We show that the charge carrier concentration and transport properties can be controlled via both aliovalent cation dopants and anion defects, enabling reversible switching between n-type and p-type conductivity. This tunability is of importance for envisaged applications of hexagonal manganites in, e.g. next-generation capacitors and domain-wall nanoelectronics, or as catalysts or electrodes in fuel cells or electrolyzers. Furthermore, our approach is transferrable to other transition metal oxides, providing general guidelines for controlling their semiconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Fragile altermagnetism and orbital disorder in Mott insulator LaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on ab initio calculations, we demonstrate that a Mott insulator LaTiO$_3$ (LTO), not inspected previously as an altermagnetic material, shows the characteristic features of altermagnets, i.e., (i) fully compensated antiferromagnetism and (ii) $\mathbf{k}$-dependent spin-split electron bands in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The altermagnetic ground state of LTO is protected by the crystal symmetry and specifically ordered $d$-orbitals of Ti ions with the orbital momentum $l=2.$ The altermagnetism occurs when sites of Ti pair in the unit cell are occupied by single electrons with $m=-1,s_{z}=+1/2$ and $m=+1,s_{z}=-1/2$ per site, with $m$ and $s_{z}-$ being the $z-$ component of the orbital momentum and spin, respectively. By further simulating orbital disorder within the Green's function method, we disclose its damaging character on the spin splitting and the resulting altermagnetism. When the single-electron spin-polarized state at each Ti site is contributed almost equally by two or three $t_{2g}$ orbitals, LTO becomes antiferromagnetic. The effect of the spin-orbit coupling, which can cause orbital disorder and suppress altermagnetism, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Study of Kitaev--Heisenberg Model on a Triangular Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:1512.02334v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Kitaev--Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice by using the two-dimensional density-matrix renormalization group method. Calculating the ground-state energy and spin structure factors, we obtain a ground-state phase diagram of the Kitaev--Heisenberg model. As suggested by previous studies, we find a 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase, a nematic phase, a dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase (the dual counterpart of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase), a $\mathbb{Z}_6$ ferromagnetic phase, and a dual ferromagnetic phase (the dual counterpart of the $\mathbb{Z}_6 $ ferromagnetic phase). Spin correlations discontinuously change at phase boundaries because of first-order phase transitions. We also study the relation among the von Neumann entanglement entropy, entanglement spectrum, and phase transitions of the model. We find that the Schmidt gap closes at phase boundaries and thus the entanglement entropy clearly changes as well. This is different from the Kitaev--Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice, where the Schmidt gap and entanglement entropy are not necessarily a good measure of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimension and the counting rule of the Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is argued that there are a set of orthonormal basis states, which appear as highly degenerate ground states arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking with a type-B Goldstone mode, and they are scale-invariant, with a salient feature that the entanglement entropy $S(n)$ scales logarithmically with the block size $n$ in the thermodynamic limit. As it turns out, the prefactor is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes $N_B$. This is achieved by performing an exact Schmidt decomposition of the orthonormal basis states, thus unveiling their self-similarities in the real space - the essence of a fractal. Combining with a field-theoretic prediction [O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and B. Doyon, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 120401 (2012)], we are led to the identification of the fractal dimension $d_f$ with the number of type-B Goldstone modes $N_B$ for the orthonormal basis states in quantum many-body systems undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-reversal in dilute Li$_2$(Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)N with $x &lt; 1$ % is dominated by resonant quantum tunneling of spatially well-separated states. We report on the effect of finite couplings between those states that give rise to cooperative, simultaneous quantum tunneling of two spins. This phenomenon, known as spin-spin cross relaxation, effectively elucidates the fine-structure observed in isothermal magnetization loops, a previously unresolved aspect. Temperature and field-dependent magnetization measurements were conducted over a range from T = 2 K to 300 K in applied fields of up to $\mu_0H$ = 7 T. Magnetic dipole fields are computed numerically. Our findings affirm the absence of stoichiometric defects in Li$_2$(Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)N and underscore its exemplary suitability as a model system for investigating spin-reversal processes at the microscopic level. This is attributed to its comparatively simple crystal structure, the availability of large single crystals, elevated characteristic energies, and well-defined energy levels</description>

      <title>Dopant pairing in a disordered magnetic spin ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying high-temperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory for strongly correlated effective Hamiltonians using effective field theory methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17627</link>

Abstract: Introducing low-energy effective Hamiltonians is usual to grasp most correlations in quantum many-body problems. For instance, such effective Hamiltonians can be treated at the mean-field level to reproduce some physical properties of interest. Employing effective Hamiltonians that contain many-body correlations renders the use of perturbative many-body techniques difficult because of the overcounting of correlations. In this work, we develop a strategy to apply an extension of the many-body perturbation theory starting from an effective interaction that contains correlations beyond the mean field level. The goal is to re-organize the many-body calculation to avoid the overcounting of correlations originating from the introduction of correlated effective Hamiltonians in the description. For this purpose, we generalize the formulation of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory by including free parameters adjusted to reproduce the appropriate limits. In particular, the expansion in the bare weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling limit serves as a valuable input to fix the value of the free parameters appearing in the resulting expression. This method avoids double counting of correlations using beyond-mean-field strategies for the description of many-body systems. The ground state energy of various systems relevant for ultracold atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics is reproduced qualitatively beyond the domain of validity of the standard many-body perturbation theory. Finally, our method suggests interpreting the formal results obtained as an effective field theory using the proposed reorganization of the many-body calculation. The results, like ground state energies, are improved systematically by considering higher orders in the extended many-body perturbation theory while maintaining a straightforward polynomial expansion.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Bootstrap and Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>High-throughput search for topological magnon materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological magnons give rise to possibilities for engineering novel spintronics devices with critical applications in quantum information and computation, due to its symmetry-protected robustness and low dissipation. However, to make reliable and systematic predictions about material realization of topological magnons has been a major challenge, due to the lack of neutron scattering data for most materials. In this work, we significantly advance the symmetry-based approach for identifying topological magnons through developing a fully automated algorithm, utilizing the theory of symmetry indicators, that enables a highly efficient and large-scale search for candidate materials hosting field-induced topological magnons. This progress not only streamlines the discovery process but also expands the scope of materials exploration beyond previous manual or traditional methods, offering a powerful tool for uncovering novel topological phases in magnetic systems. Performing a large-scale search over all 1649 magnetic materials in Bilbao Crystallographic Server with a commensurate magnetic order, we discover 387 candidate materials for topological magnons, significantly expanding the pool of topological magnon materials. We further discuss examples and experimental accessibility of the candidate materials, shedding light on future experimental realizations of topological magnons in magnetic materials.</description>
