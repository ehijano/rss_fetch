      <title>Analysis of invariants in non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics leading to hierarchies of coupled Volterra gyrostats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with the analysis of the existence and number of invariants in a hitherto unexplored class of dynamical systems that lie at the intersection of two major classes of dynamical systems. The first is the conservative core dynamics of low-order models that arise naturally when we project infinite dimensional PDEs into a finite dimensional subspace using the classical Galerkin method. These often have the form of coupled gyrostatic low order models (GLOMs). Second is the class of non-canonical Hamiltonian models obtained by systematically coupling the basic component systems, the Volterra gyrostat and its special cases such as the Euler gyrostat. While it is known that the Volterra gyrostat enjoys two invariants, it turns out that members of the GLOM exhibit varying numbers of invariants. The principal contribution of this study is to relate the structure of GLOMs to the number of invariants and describe the importance of the non-canonical Hamiltonian constraint in tackling this problem. Devising model hierarchies with consistent invariants is important because these constrain the evolution as well as asymptotic behavior of these dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\R^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of a certain subset of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\R^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>

      <title>Linear Relations of Finite Length Modules are Shift Equivalent to Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear relations, defined as submodules of the direct sum of two modules, can be viewed as objects that carry dynamical information and reflect the inherent uncertainty of sampled dynamics. These objects also provide an algebraic structure that enables the definition of subtle invariants for dynamical systems. In this paper, we prove that linear relations defined on modules of finite length are shift equivalent to bijective mappings.</description>

      <title>Quantization dimension for a generalized inhomogeneous bi-Lipschitz iterated function system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given $r\in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, of a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$ represents the speed how fast the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exists, we call $\underline D_r(\mu)$ and $\overline D_r(\mu)$, the lower and upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$. In this paper, we estimate the quantization dimension of condensation measures associated with condensation systems $(\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N, (p_i)_{i=0}^N, \nu)$, where the mappings $f_i$ are bi-Lipschitz and the measure $\nu$ is an image measure of an ergodic measure with bounded distortion supported on a conformal set. In addition, we determine the optimal quantization for an infinite discrete distribution, and give an example which shows that the quantization dimension of a Borel probability measure can be positive with zero quantization coefficient.</description>

      <title>Robust upper estimates for topological entropy via nonlinear constrained optimization over adapted metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical-numerical method providing robust upper estimates for the topological entropy or, more generally, uniform volume growth exponents of differentiable mappings. By introducing varying metrics, we simplify the analysis at the cost of generally rougher bounds, but keeping the prospect of choosing more relatable metrics to refine the estimates. With any covering of an invariant set by a finite number of cubes, we associate a graph describing overlaps (edges) of the cubes (vertices) under iterates of the mapping. Weighing vertices according to a given metric, we reduce the problem to finding simple cycles with maximal relative weights. Then we develop an algorithm concerned with iterative resolving nonlinear programming problems for optimization of maximal relative weights in general smooth families of metrics which may involve interpolation or neural networks models. We describe applications of the algorithm to compute the largest uniform Lyapunov exponent and uniform Lyapunov dimension for the H\'{e}non and Rabinovich systems justifying the Eden conjecture at stationary and periodic points respectively.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a functional-analytical machinery for studying the quadratic regulator problem arising from spectra perturbations of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In particular, we are interested in applications to inertial manifolds theory. For certain nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems associated with such problems, we show the existence and uniform nonoscillation of stable Lagrangian bundles. This is done within the context of the classical frequency condition for stationary problems, as well as for nonstationary problems arising under the conditions of the Spatial Averaging Principle of J. Mallet-Paret and G.R. Sell.</description>

      <title>Constrained polynomial roots and a modulated approach to Schur stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common in stability analysis to linearize a system and investigate the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix. This approach faces the challenge of determining the matrix spectrum when the coefficients depend on parameters or when the characteristic polynomial is more than quartic. In this paper, we reverse the classical process and use the authors' work on global stability to find sufficient conditions on the coefficients that ensure the zeros of the characteristic polynomial are in the open unit disk. This leads to an algorithm that begins by testing the $\ell_1$-norm of the polynomial, and if it is not less than two, perform an iteration process that can be implemented with moderate effort. We give examples that show the effectiveness of our method when compared with the Jury's algorithm. Last, we formalize our constructions in terms of semialgebraic sets.</description>

      <title>On the emergence and properties of weird quasiperiodic attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently described a specific type of attractors of two-dimensional discontinuous piecewise linear maps, characterized by two discontinuity lines dividing the phase plane into three partitions, related to economic applications. To our knowledge, this type of attractor, which we call a weird quasiperiodic attractor, has not yet been studied in detail. They have a rather complex geometric structure and other interesting properties that are worth understanding better. To this end, we consider a simpler map that can also possess weird quasiperiodic attractors, namely, a 2D discontinuous piecewise linear map $F$ with a single discontinuity line dividing the phase plane into two partitions, where two different homogeneous linear maps are defined. Map $F$ depends on four parameters -- the traces and determinants of the two Jacobian matrices. In the parameter space of map $F$, we obtain specific regions associated with the existence of weird quasiperiodic attractors; describe some characteristic properties of these attractors; and explain one of the possible mechanisms of their appearance.</description>

      <title>A mathematical perspective on the paradox that chemotherapy sometimes works backwards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doctors are well aware that sometimes cancer treatments not only fail, but even work backwards, i.e. they make the treated tumor grow. In this work we present a mathematical perspective on this paradox in the case of chemotherapy, by studying a minimally parameterized mathematical model for the system composed of the tumor and the surrounding vasculature. To this end, we will use a system of two well-established nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which incorporates the cytotoxic (via the Norton-Simon hypothesis) and antiangiogenic effects of chemotherapy. Finally, we provide two theoretical ways to avoid these anomalies.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation on Jacobi structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jacobi structures are known to generalize Poisson structures, encompassing symplectic, cosymplectic, and Lie-Poisson manifolds. Notably, other intriguing geometric structures -- such as contact and locally conformal symplectic manifolds -- also admit Jacobi structures but do not belong to the Poisson category. In this paper, we employ global stochastic analysis techniques, initially developed by Meyer and Schwartz, to rigorously introduce stochastic Hamiltonian systems on Jacobi manifolds. We then propose a stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) framework as an alternative perspective on the underlying dynamics. We emphasize that many of our results extend the work of Bismut [Bis80, Bis81] and L\'azaro-Cam\'i \&amp; Ortega [LCO08, LCO09]. Furthermore, aspects of our geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory in the stochastic setting draw inspiration from the deterministic contributions of Abraham \&amp; Marsden [AM78], de Le\'on \&amp; Sard\'on [dLS17], Esen et al. [EdLSZ21], and related literature.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously structured compartmental models of epidemiological systems: from individual-level processes to population-scale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general modelling framework for compartmental epidemiological systems structured by continuous variables which are linked to the levels of expression of compartment-specific traits. We start by formulating an individual-based model that describes the dynamics of single individuals in terms of stochastic processes. Then we formally derive: (i) the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which is formulated as a system of integro-differential equations for the distributions of individuals over the structuring-variable domains of the different compartments; (ii) the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations for the fractions of individuals in the different compartments and the mean levels of expression of the traits represented by the structuring variables. We employ a reduced version of the macroscopic model to obtain a general formula for the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, in terms of key parameters and functions of the underlying microscopic model, so as to illustrate how such a modelling framework makes it possible to draw connections between fundamental individual-level processes and population-scale dynamics. Finally we apply the modelling framework to case studies based on classical compartmental epidemiological systems, for each of which we report on Monte Carlo simulations of the individual-based model as well as on analytical results and numerical solutions of the macroscopic model.</description>

      <title>Ergodic exploration of dynamic distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of performing search missions in dynamic environments, particularly for drifting targets whose movement is dictated by a flow field. This is accomplished through a dynamical system that integrates two partial differential equations: one governing the dynamics and uncertainty of the probability distribution, and the other regulating the potential field for ergodic multi-agent search. The target probability field evolves in response to the target dynamics imposed by the environment and accomplished sensing efforts, while being explored by multiple robot agents guided by the potential field gradient. The proposed methodology was tested on two simulated search scenarios, one of which features a synthetically generated domain and showcases better performance when compared to the baseline method with static target probability over a range of agent to flow field velocity ratios. The second search scenario represents a realistic sea search and rescue mission where the search start is delayed, the search is performed in multiple robot flight missions, and the procedure for target drift uncertainty compensation is demonstrated. Furthermore, the proposed method provides an accurate survey completion metric, based on the known detection/sensing parameters, that correlates with the actual number of targets found independently.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again study a surprising connection between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n&gt;1$ and $d&gt;2$ an integer. As in \cite{BK1}, we wish to study counting problems which are inspired by exciting advances in arithmetic statistics, and partly by a point-counting result of Narkiewicz on real $K$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we show that for any given prime integer $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is a real algebraic number field of any degree $n\geq 2$ is $3$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by a $K$-rational periodic point-counting result of Benedetto on any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then show unconditionally that the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is any number field (not necessarily real) of degree $n\geq 2$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then apply statistical results from arithmetic statistics to then deduce here several counting and statistical results; and among them includes applying here a more recent number field-counting result of Oliver Lemke-Thorne to then bound above the number of number fields $K_{f}:= K[x]\slash (f(x))$ of degree $m:= np^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant; and also bound above the number of number fields $L_{g}:= K[x]\slash (g(x))$ of degree $r:= n(p-1)^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant.</description>

      <title>Effective Soliton Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these solitons, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of soliton locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>

Abstract: Solving the Fokker-Planck equation for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems remains a pivotal yet challenging task due to the intractability of analytical solutions and the limitations of traditional numerical methods. In this work, we present FlowKac, a novel approach that reformulates the Fokker-Planck equation using the Feynman-Kac formula, allowing to query the solution at a given point via the expected values of stochastic paths. A key innovation of FlowKac lies in its adaptive stochastic sampling scheme which significantly reduces the computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. This sampling technique, coupled with a time-indexed normalizing flow, designed for capturing time-evolving probability densities, enables robust sampling of collocation points, resulting in a flexible and mesh-free solver. This formulation mitigates the curse of dimensionality and enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, which is particularly crucial for applications that inherently require dimensions beyond the conventional three. We validate the robustness and scalability of our method through various experiments on a range of stochastic differential equations, demonstrating significant improvements over existing techniques.</description>

      <title>L\'evy areas, Wong Zakai anomalies in diffusive limits of Deterministic Lagrangian Multi-Time Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Stochastic modelling necessitates an interpretation of noise. In this paper, we describe the loss of deterministically stable behaviour in a fundamental fluid mechanics problem, conditional to whether noise is introduced in the sense of It\^o, Stratonovich or a limit of Wong-Zakai type. We examine this comparison in the wider context of discretising stochastic differential equations with and without the L\'evy area. From the numerical viewpoint, we demonstrate performing higher order discretisations with the use of a L\'evy area can lead to the loss of conserved area and angle quantities. Such behaviour is not physically expected in the Stratonovich model. Conversely, we study Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport and its derivation from homogenisation theory, which introduces drift corrections of the same class naturally. From the viewpoint of homogenisation, the qualitative properties of the Wong-Zakai anomaly are physically motivated as arising due to correlations from a fast and mean scale fluid decomposition.</description>

      <title>Linear System Analysis and Optimal Control of Natural Gas Dynamics in Pipeline Networks</title>

Abstract: We design nonlinear and adaptive linear model-predictive control (MPC) techniques to minimize operational costs of compressor-actuated dynamics in natural gas pipeline networks. We establish stability of the local linear system and derive rigorous bounds on error between the nonlinear and linear system solutions. These bounds are used to quantify conditions under which the linear MPC can substitute the nonlinear MPC without significant loss of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we prove and numerically verify that the computational cost of the linear MPC is orders of magnitude lower than that of solving the baseline optimal control problem. Numerical simulations are performed on nontrivial networks to demonstrate that the proposed MPC can effectively adapt to varying load conditions while maintaining nearly 95% optimality.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07594v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets.
  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</description>

      <title>Non-density results in high dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We push forward the study of higher dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology by establishing two non-density results. First, we prove that stable hypersurfaces are not $C^3$-dense in any isotopy class of embedded hypersurfaces on any ambient symplectic manifold of dimension $2n\geq 8$. Our second result is that on any manifold of dimension $2m+1\geq 5$, the set of non-degenerate stable Hamiltonian structures is not $C^2$-dense among stable Hamiltonian structures in any given stable homotopy class that satisfies a mild assumption. The latter generalizes a result by Cieliebak and Volkov to arbitrary dimensions.</description>
