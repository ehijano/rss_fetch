      <title>Auger Open Data and the Pierre Auger Observatory International Masterclasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has a public data policy following the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). We aim to share the data with the scientific community as part of the multi-messenger effort at different levels and for educational activities to engage the general public. Following the first portal created in 2007, a new portal hosted at \url{https://opendata.auger.org} was established in February 2021. The portal is regularly updated and comprises 10\% of the recorded cosmic-ray data organized in various datasets, each with a specific DOI provided by Zenodo. Moreover, a catalog with the 100 most energetic events is available. The portal adopts a ``dual'' concept, offering not only the download of public data but also a series of Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks allow the general public to reproduce some of the most important results obtained by the Pierre Auger Collaboration and understand the main mechanisms governing the development of the extensive air showers produced by the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. In 2023, the Pierre Auger Observatory joined the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG). The successful debut enrolled 550 high-school students at 12 research institutions from 5 countries and was repeated this year, embracing yet more students and countries worldwide. During this day, the participants attend seminars about cosmic rays and are asked to reconstruct subsets of public data events using an Auger 3-D event display. Finally, they participate in a Zoom session with scientists at the Auger site.</description>

      <title>Four years of wide-field search for nanosecond optical transients with the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been previously demonstrated [Panov et al. Physics of Atomic Nuclei 84(2021)1037] that the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array, originally built for cosmic ray physics and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray astronomy studies using the extensive air shower method, can be used in conventional optical astronomy for wide-field searches for rare nanosecond optical transients of astrophysical origin. The FOV of the facility is on the scale of 1~ster, and it is capable of detecting very rare transients in the visible light range with fluxes greater than approximately 3000~quanta/m$^2$/10~ns (10~ns is the apparatus integration time) and pulse durations of 10\,ns. Among the potential sources of distant nanosecond optical transients are the evaporation of primary black holes, magnetic reconnection in the accretion disks of black holes, and signals from distant lasers of extraterrestrial civilizations. The paper describes the methods and results of the search for optical transients using the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array from 2018 to 2022 (four winter seasons of data collection). No reliable astrophysical candidates for optical transients were found. We set an upper bound on the flux of the searched events as $\sim 1\times10^{-3}$\,events/ster/h.</description>

      <title>Interactive Multimodal Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using sonification on scientific data analysis provides additional dimensions to visualization, potentially increasing researchers' analytical capabilities and fostering inclusion and accessibility. This research explores the potential of multimodal Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) applied to galaxy analysis through the development and evaluation of a tool that complements the visualization of datacubes with sound. The proposed application, \textit{ViewCube}, provides interactive visualizations and sonifications of spectral information across a two-dimensional field-of-view, and its architecture is designed to incorporate future sonification approaches. The first sonification implementation described in this article uses a deep learning module to generate binaural unsupervised auditory representations. The work includes a qualitative and quantitative user study based on an online questionnaire, aimed at both specialized and non-specialized participants, focusing on the case study of datacubes of galaxies from the Calar Alto Integral Field Spectroscopy Area (CALIFA) survey. Out of 67 participants who completed the questionnaire, 42 had the opportunity to test the application in person prior to filling out the online survey. 81\% of these 42 participants expressed the good interactive response of the tool, 79.1\% of the complete sample found the application "Useful", and 58.2\% rated its aesthetics as "Good". The quantitative results suggest that all participants were able to retrieve information from the sonifications, pointing to previous experience in the analysis of sound events as more helpful than previous knowledge of the data for the proposed tasks, and highlighting the importance of training and attention to detail for the understanding of complex auditory information.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent System for Cosmological Parameter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00431v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing multiple Large Language Model agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation and that can execute code locally may become beneficial in cosmological data analysis. Here, we illustrate a first small step towards AI-assisted analyses and a glimpse of the potential of MAS to automate and optimize scientific workflows in Cosmology. The system architecture of our example package, that builds upon the autogen/ag2 framework, can be applied to MAS in any area of quantitative scientific research. The particular task we apply our methods to is the cosmological parameter analysis of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing power spectrum likelihood using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our work-in-progress code is open source and available at https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent.</description>

      <title>Subsweep: Extensions to the Sweep method for radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the radiative transfer postprocessing code Subsweep. The code is based on the method of transport sweeps, in which the exact solution to the scattering-less radiative transfer equation is computed in a single pass through the entire computational grid. The radiative transfer module is coupled to radiation chemistry, and chemical compositions as well as temperatures of the cells are evolved according to photon fluxes computed during radiative transfer. Subsweep extends the method of transport sweeps by incorporating sub-timesteps in a hierarchy of partial sweeps of the grid. This alleviates the need for a low, global timestep and as a result Subsweep is able to drastically reduce the amount of computation required for accurate integration of the coupled radiation chemistry equations. We succesfully apply the code to a number of physical tests such as the expansion of HII regions, the formation of shadows behind dense objects, and its behavior in the presence of periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The WALOP-North Instrument I: Optical Design, Filter Design, Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide Area Linear Optical Polarimeter North (WALOP-North) is an optical polarimeter designed for the needs of the PASIPHAE survey. It will be installed on the 1.3m telescope at the Skinakas Observatory in Crete, Greece. After commissioning, it will measure the polarization of millions of stars at high Galactic latitude, aiming to measure hundreds of stars per $deg^2$. The astronomical filter used in the instrument is a modified, polarimetrically-neutral broadband SDSS-r. This instrument will be pioneering one due to its large field-of-view (FoV) of $30\times 30$ $arcmin^2$ and high accuracy polarimetry measurements. The accuracy and sensitivity of the instrument in polarization fraction will be at the 0.1\% and 0.05\% level, respectively. Four separate 4k$\times$4k CCDs will be used as the instrument detectors, each imaging one of the $0\deg{}, 45\deg{}, 90\deg{}$ and $135\deg{}$ polarized FoV separately, therefore making the instrument a four-channel, one-shot polarimeter. Here, we present the overall optical design of the instrument, emphasizing on the aspects of the instrument that are different from WALOP-South. We also present a novel design of filters appropriate for polarimetry along with details on the management of the instrument size and its polarimetric calibration.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Design, Integration, and Current Status of Small Aperture Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at an elevation of 5200 meters, nominally consisting of an array of three 0.42-meter small aperture telescopes (SATs) and one 6-meter large aperture telescope (LAT). SO will make accurate measurements of the CMB temperature and polarization spanning six frequency bands ranging from 27 to 280 GHz, fielding a total of $\sim$68,000 detectors covering angular scales between one arcminute to tens of degrees. In this paper, we focus on the SATs, which are tailored to search for primordial gravitational waves, with the primary science goal of measuring the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio \textit{r} at a target level of $\sigma(r) \approx 0.003$. We discuss the design drivers, scientific impact, and current deployment status of the three SATs, which are scheduled to start taking data in the coming year. The SATs aim to map 10\% of the sky at a 2 $\mu$K-arcmin noise level observing at mid-frequencies (93/145 GHz), with additional ultra-high-frequency (225/280 GHz) and low-frequency (27/39 GHz) targets to yield galactic foreground-subtracted measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment located in the Atacama Desert in Chile that will make precise temperature and polarization measurements over six spectral bands ranging from 27 to 285 GHz. Three small aperture telescopes (SATs) and one large aperture telescope (LAT) will house $\sim$60,000 detectors and cover angular scales between one arcminute and tens of degrees. We present the performance of the dichroic, low-frequency (LF) lenslet-coupled sinuous antenna transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometer arrays with bands centered at 27 and 39 GHz. The LF focal plane will primarily characterize Galactic synchrotron emission as a critical part of foreground subtraction from CMB data. We will discuss the design, optimization, and current testing status of these pixels.</description>

      <title>Selfish Evolution: Making Discoveries in Extreme Label Noise with the Help of Overfitting Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the scarcity of proper labels in an astrophysical application, we have developed a novel technique, called Selfish Evolution, which allows for the detection and correction of corrupted labels in a weakly supervised fashion. Unlike methods based on early stopping, we let the model train on the noisy dataset. Only then do we intervene and allow the model to overfit to individual samples. The ``evolution'' of the model during this process reveals patterns with enough information about the noisiness of the label, as well as its correct version. We train a secondary network on these spatiotemporal ``evolution cubes'' to correct potentially corrupted labels. We incorporate the technique in a closed-loop fashion, allowing for automatic convergence towards a mostly clean dataset, without presumptions about the state of the network in which we intervene. We evaluate on the main task of the Supernova-hunting dataset but also demonstrate efficiency on the more standard MNIST dataset.</description>

Abstract: High energy neutrino astronomy has seen significant progress in the past few years. This includes the detection of neutrino flux from the Galactic plane, as well as strong evidence for neutrino emission from the active galaxy NGC 1068, both reported by IceCube. New results start coming from the two km$^3$-scale neutrino telescopes under construction in the Northern hemisphere: KM3NeT in the Mediterranean Sea and Baikal-GVD in Lake Baikal. After briefly reviewing the status of the field, we present the current status of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope and its recent results, including observations of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>RoBo6: Standardized MMT Light Curve Dataset for Rocket Body Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space debris presents a critical challenge for the sustainability of future space missions, emphasizing the need for robust and standardized identification methods. However, a comprehensive benchmark for rocket body classification remains absent. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the RoBo6 dataset for rocket body classification based on light curves. The dataset, derived from the Mini Mega Tortora database, includes light curves for six rocket body classes: CZ-3B, Atlas 5 Centaur, Falcon 9, H-2A, Ariane 5, and Delta 4. With 5,676 training and 1,404 test samples, it addresses data inconsistencies using resampling, normalization, and filtering techniques. Several machine learning models were evaluated, including CNN and transformer-based approaches, with Astroconformer reporting the best performance. The dataset establishes a common benchmark for future comparisons and advancements in rocket body classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of microlensed gravitational waves with Conditional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a unique opportunity to study cosmology and astrophysics at multiple scales. Detecting microlensing signatures, in particular, requires efficient parameter estimation methods due to the high computational cost of traditional Bayesian inference. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), to estimate parameters of microlensed binary black hole (simulated) waveforms. We find that our CVAE model yields accurate parameter estimation and significant computational savings compared to Bayesian methods such as bilby (up to five orders of magnitude faster inferences). Moreover, the incorporation of CVAE-generated priors in bilby reduces the average runtime of the latter in about 48% with no penalty on its accuracy. Our results suggest that a CVAE model is a promising tool for future low-latency searches of lensed signals. Further applications to actual signals and integration with advanced pipelines could help extend the capabilities of GW observatories in detecting microlensing events.</description>

      <title>Adding RR Lyrae $y$-Band Template Light Curves to gatspy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complement the $y$-band template light curves for RR Lyrae to the well-established template light curves in the $ugriz$-band, where the latter have been adopted in the astroML/gatspy python package as one of the period-search methods for RR Lyrae. These $y$-band template light curves were constructed based on the $z$-band time series data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the $y$-band light curves from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and dedicated $y$-band observations using the Lulin One-meter Telescope for RR Lyrae located in the SDSS Stripe 82 region. These $y$-band template light curves, 9 for the ab-type RR Lyrae and 3 for the c-type RR Lyrae, can be applied in conjunction to the $ugriz$-band template light curves for upcoming sky surveys involving the $y$-band, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</description>

      <title>3D-PDR Orion dataset and NeuralPDR: Neural Differential Equations for Photodissociation Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel dataset of simulations of the photodissociation region (PDR) in the Orion Bar and provide benchmarks of emulators for the dataset. Numerical models of PDRs are computationally expensive since the modeling of these changing regions requires resolving the thermal balance and chemical composition along a line-of-sight into an interstellar cloud. This often makes it a bottleneck for 3D simulations of these regions. In this work, we provide a dataset of 8192 models with different initial conditions simulated with 3D-PDR. We then benchmark different architectures, focusing on Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ANODE) based models (Code be found at https://github.com/uclchem/neuralpdr). Obtaining fast and robust emulators that can be included as preconditioners of classical codes or full emulators into 3D simulations of PDRs.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>

      <title>Explicit symplectic integrators with adaptive time steps in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, our group developed explicit symplectic methods for curved spacetimes that are not split into several explicitly integrable parts, but are via appropriate time transformations. Such time-transformed explicit symplectic integrators should have employed adaptive time steps in principle, but they are often difficult in practical implementations. In fact, they work well if time transformation functions cause the time-transformed Hamiltonians to have the desired splits and approach 1 or constants for sufficiently large distances. However, they do not satisfy the requirement of step-size selections in this case. Based on the step-size control technique proposed by Preto $\&amp;$ Saha, the nonadaptive time step time-transformed explicit symplectic methods are slightly adjusted as adaptive ones. The adaptive methods have only two additional steps and a negligible increase in computational cost as compared with the nonadaptive ones. Their implementation is simple. Several dynamical simulations of particles and photons near black holes have demonstrated that the adaptive methods typically improve the efficiency of the nonadaptive methods. Because of the desirable property, the new adaptive methods are applied to investigate the chaotic dynamics of particles and photons outside the horizon in a Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. The new methods are widely applicable to all curved spacetimes corresponding to Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians with the expected splits. Also application to the backwards ray-tracing method for studying the motion of photons and shadows of black holes is possible.</description>

      <title>Adaptive cancellation of mains power interference in continuous gravitational wave searches with a hidden Markov model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational wave searches with terrestrial, long-baseline interferometers are hampered by long-lived, narrowband features in the power spectral density of the detector noise, known as lines. Candidate GW signals which overlap spectrally with known lines are typically vetoed. Here we demonstrate a line subtraction method based on adaptive noise cancellation, using a recursive least squares algorithm, a common approach in electrical engineering applications such as audio and biomedical signal processing. We validate the line subtraction method by combining it with a hidden Markov model (HMM), a standard continuous wave search tool, to detect an injected continuous wave signal with an unknown and randomly wandering frequency, which overlaps with the mains power line at $60 \, {\rm Hz}$ in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The performance of the line subtraction method is tested on an injected continuous wave signal obscured by (a) synthetic noise data with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian components, and (b) real noise data obtained from the LIGO Livingston detector. In both cases, before applying the line subtraction method the HMM does not detect the injected continuous wave signal. After applying the line subtraction method the mains power line is suppressed by 20--40 dB, and the HMM detects the underlying signal, with a time-averaged root-mean-square error in the frequency estimate of $\sim 0.05 $ Hz. The performance of the line subtraction method with respect to the characteristics of the 60 Hz line and the control parameters of the recursive least squares algorithm is quantified in terms of receiver operating characteristic curves.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array: The $4.5$-year data release and the noise and stochastic signals of the millisecond pulsar population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are ensembles of regularly observed millisecond pulsars timed to high precision. Each pulsar in an array could be affected by a suite of noise processes, most of which are astrophysically motivated. Analysing them carefully can be used to understand these physical processes. However, the primary purpose of these experiments is to detect signals that are common to all pulsars, in particular signals associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background. To detect this, it is paramount to appropriately characterise other signals that may otherwise impact array sensitivity or cause a spurious detection. Here we describe the second data release and first detailed noise analysis of the pulsars in the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array, comprising high-cadence and high-precision observations of $83$ millisecond pulsars over $4.5$ years. We use this analysis to search for a common signal in the data, finding a process with an amplitude of $\log_{10}\mathrm{A_{CURN}} = -14.25^{+0.21}_{-0.36}$ and spectral index $\gamma_\mathrm{CURN} = 3.60^{+1.31}_{-0.89}$. Fixing the spectral index at the value predicted for a background produced by the inspiral of binary supermassive black holes, we measure the amplitude to be $\log_{10}\mathrm{A_{CURN}} = -14.28^{+0.21}_{-0.21}$ at a significance expressed as a Bayes factor of $\ln(\mathcal{B}) = 4.46$. Under both assumptions, the amplitude that we recover is larger than those reported by other PTA experiments. We use the results of this analysis to forecast our sensitivity to a gravitational wave background possessing the spectral properties of the common signal we have measured.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and unsupervised transient classification in high-energy datasets. This approach enabled the discovery of a new fast X-ray transient (FXT) in the Chandra archive, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous breakthroughs in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t Maps and E-t-dt Cubes, designed to capture both temporal and spectral information, effectively addressing the challenges posed by variable-length event file time series in machine learning applications. Our pipeline extracts low-dimensional, informative features from these representations using principal component analysis or sparse autoencoders, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbor searches around known transients, producing a catalog of 3,539 candidates (3,427 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard &lt;10 s initial burst followed by spectral softening in an ~800 s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint LMXB in the LMC. Our method extends to datasets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</description>

Abstract: The Torsion-Bar Antenna (TOBA) is a torsion pendulum-based gravitational detector developed to observe gravitational waves in frequencies between 1 mHz and 10 Hz. The low resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum enables observation in this frequency band on the ground. The final target of TOBA is to observe gravitational waves with a 10 m detector and expand the observation band of gravitational waves. In this paper, an overview of TOBA, including the previous prototype experiments and the current ongoing development, is presented.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Jupiter's interior using machine learning reveals four key structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal structure of Jupiter is constrained by the precise gravity field measurements by NASA's Juno mission, atmospheric data from the Galileo entry probe, and Voyager radio occultations. Not only are these observations few compared to the possible interior setups and their multiple controlling parameters, but they remain challenging to reconcile. As a complex, multidimensional problem, characterizing typical structures can help simplify the modeling process. We used NeuralCMS, a deep learning model based on the accurate concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method, coupled with a fully consistent wind model to efficiently explore a wide range of interior models without prior assumptions. We then identified those consistent with the measurements and clustered the plausible combinations of parameters controlling the interior. We determine the plausible ranges of internal structures and the dynamical contributions to Jupiter's gravity field. Four typical interior structures are identified, characterized by their envelope and core properties. This reduces the dimensionality of Jupiter's interior to only two effective parameters. Within the reduced 2D phase space, we show that the most observationally constrained structures fall within one of the key structures, but they require a higher 1 bar temperature than the observed value. We provide a robust framework for characterizing giant planet interiors with consistent wind treatment, demonstrating that for Jupiter, wind constraints strongly impact the gravity harmonics while the interior parameter distribution remains largely unchanged. Importantly, we find that Jupiter's interior can be described by two effective parameters that clearly distinguish the four characteristic structures and conclude that atmospheric measurements may not fully represent the entire envelope.</description>

      <title>A Well-Characterized Survey for Centaurs in Pan-STARRS1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To prepare for the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time, we develop methods for quantifying the selection function of a wide-field survey as a function of all six orbital parameters and absolute magnitude. We perform a HelioLinC3D search for Centaurs in the Pan-STARRS1 detection catalog and use a synthetic debiasing population to characterize our survey's selection function. We find nine new objects, including Centaur 2010 RJ$_{226}$, among 320 real objects, along with $\sim$70,000 debiasing objects. We use the debiasing population to fit a selection function and apply the selection function to a model Centaur population with literature orbital and size distributions. We confirm the model's marginal distributions but reject its joint distribution, and estimate an intrinsic population of 21,400$^{+3,400}_{-2,800}$ Centaurs with $H_r &lt; 13.7$. The discovery of only nine new objects in archival data verifies that the Pan-STARRS discovery pipeline had high completeness, but also shows that new linking algorithms can contribute even to traditional single-tracklet surveys. As the first systematic application of HelioLinC3D to a survey with extensive sky coverage, this project proves the viability of HelioLinC3D as a discovery algorithm for big-data wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Effects of Array Mutual Coupling in 21-cm Experiments with the SKA-Low Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Mutual Coupling (MC) between antennas on the time-delay power spectrum response of the core of the SKA-Low radio telescope. Using two in-house tools - Fast Array Simulation Tool (FAST) (a fast full-wave electromagnetic solver) and OSKAR (a GPU-accelerated radio telescope simulator) - we simulate station beams and compute visibilities for various array layouts (regular, sunflower, and random). Simulations are conducted in an Epoch of Reionisation subband between 120-150~MHz, with a fine frequency resolution of 100~kHz, enabling the investigation of late delays. Our results show that MC effects significantly increase foreground leakage into longer delays, especially for regular station layouts. For 21-cm science, foreground spill-over into the 21-cm window extends beyond $k_{\parallel} \sim 2$~h$^{-1}$Mpc for all station layouts and across all $k_{\perp}$ modes, completely obscuring the detection window. We find that attempting to remove the foreground contribution from the visibilities using an approximated beam model, based on the average embedded element pattern or interpolating the embedded element patterns from a coarse channel rate of 781~kHz, results in residuals around 1% ($\sim 10^{11}~\mathrm{mK}^2$h$^{-3}\mathrm{Mpc}^3$) which is still around 7 orders of magnitude brighter than the expected level of the EoR signal ($\sim 10^{4}~\mathrm{mK}^2$h$^{-3}\mathrm{Mpc}^3$). We also find that station beam models with at least 4-5 significant digits in the far-field pattern and high spectral resolution are needed for effective foreground removal. Our research provides critical insights into the role of MC in SKA-Low experiments and highlights the computational challenges of fully integrating array patterns that account for MC effects into processing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for fast reconstruction methods using augmented equivariant bootstrap: Application to radio interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array promises to revolutionise our radio astronomy observational capabilities. The unprecedented volume of data these devices generate requires fast and accurate image reconstruction algorithms to solve the ill-posed radio interferometric imaging problem. Most state-of-the-art reconstruction methods lack trustworthy and scalable uncertainty quantification, which is critical for the rigorous scientific interpretation of radio observations. We propose an unsupervised technique based on a conformalized version of a radio-augmented equivariant bootstrapping method, which allows us to quantify uncertainties for fast reconstruction methods. Noticeably, we rely on reconstructions from ultra-fast unrolled algorithms. The proposed method brings more reliable uncertainty estimations to our problem than existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>New semicoherent targeted search for continuous gravitational waves from pulsars in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel semicoherent targeted search method for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emitted by pulsars in binary systems. The method is based on a custom optimization of the coherence time, which is tailored according to the orbital parameters and their uncertainties, as provided by electromagnetic observations. While rotating pulsars are expected to produce quasimonochromatic CWs in their reference frame, their orbital motion introduces additional modulation in the observer's frame, alongside the modulation caused by the Earth's motion. As a result, the received signal is spread across a frequency range, and demodulation techniques must be used to improve sensitivity. However, Doppler corrections can, in some cases, vary significantly within the uncertainties of the orbital parameters, potentially lowering the detection chances of single-template, fully coherent searches. To exploit the constraints derived from electromagnetic observations, we implement a semicoherent search that is more robust than other methods. In this approach, the coherence time is evaluated for each source, taking into account the uncertainties in its orbital parameters. This method was tested and applied to a set of thirteen targets from the ATNF catalog. The search identified one outlier, whose astrophysical origin has been confidently excluded. For the first time to our knowledge, we then set upper limits on the signal strain from these 12 pulsars, with the lowest limit being $h_{UL}\sim9.01\times 10^{-26}$ for PSR~J1326-4728B.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate the successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Generative modelling for mass-mapping with fast uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197</link>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter in the Universe is an important goal of modern cosmology. A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.</description>

      <title>No evidence for fast, galaxy-wide ionised outflows in a nearby quasar -- the importance of accounting for beam smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To test the scenario that outflows accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a major impact on galaxy-wide scales, we have analysed deep VLT/MUSE data for the type-2 quasar/ultraluminous infrared galaxy F13451+1232 - an object that represents the major mergers considered in models of galaxy evolution. After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing that had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the MUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are consistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger. Therefore, the fast ($\mathrm{W_{80}}&gt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows in this object are limited to the central $\sim$100 pc of the galaxy, although we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we directly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of atmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We also show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond radial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the seeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale outflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than genuine galaxy-wide ($r&gt;5$ kpc) outflows. Our study therefore provides further evidence that warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows are limited to the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and highlights the critical importance of accounting for atmospheric seeing in ground-based observational studies of active galaxies.</description>
