      <title>Uniqueness of stationary compatible probability measure for chains of infinite order with forbidden transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider chains of infinite order on countable state spaces with prohibited transitions. We give a set of sufficient conditions on the structure of the probability kernels of the chains to have at most one stationary probability measure compatible with the kernel. Our main result extends the uniqueness $\ell^2$ criterion from Johansson and \"Oberg (2003) which was obtained for strongly non-null chains. A particular attention is given to concrete examples, illustrating the main theorem and its corollaries, with comparison to results of the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence for displacement monotone Mean Field Games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish quantitative convergence results for both open and closed-loop Nash equilibria of N-player stochastic differential games in the setting of Mean Field Games of Controls (MFGC), a class of models where interactions among agents occur through both states and controls. Our analysis covers a general class of non-separable Hamiltonians satisfying a displacement monotonicity condition, along with mild regularity and growth conditions at infinity. A major novelty of our work is the rigorous treatment of a nontrivial fixed-point problem on a space of measures, which arises naturally in the MFGC formulation. Unlike prior works that either restrict to separable Hamiltonians - rendering the fixed-point map trivial - or assume convergence or regularity properties of the fixed point map, we develop a detailed structural analysis of this equation and its N-player analogue. This leads to new regularity results for the fixed-point maps and, in turn, to quantitative convergence of open-loop equilibria. We further derive sharp a priori estimates for the N-player Nash system, enabling us to control the discrepancy between open and closed-loop strategies, and thus to conclude the convergence of closed-loop equilibria. Our framework also accommodates common noise in a natural way.</description>

      <title>Splitting phenomenon in the Sathe-Selberg theorem, mod-Poisson convergence with auxiliary randomisation and universality of the Gamma factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider several sequences of random variables whose Fourier-Laplace transforms present the same type of \textit{splitting phenomenon} when suitably rescaled by the Fourier-Laplace transform of a Poisson-distributed random variable (mod-Poisson convergence). Addressing a question raised by Kowalski-Nikeghbali, we explain the appearance of a universal term, the \textit{Gamma factor}, by a common feature of each model, the existence of an auxiliary randomisation that reveals an independence structure. This universal Gamma factor is a consequence of the probabilistic (exponential) fluctuations of this subordinated random variable.
  The class of examples that belong to this framework includes: random uniform permutations, random Gauss integers, random polynomials over a finite field, random matrices with values in a finite field, random partitions and the classical Sathe-Selberg theorems in probabilistic number theory. For this last example, the randomisation that triggers the Gamma factor defines a new probability distribution, the ``delta-Zeta distribution'' which is the analogue of the geometric distribution in the permutation setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive Sobolev regularity theory for the Dirichlet problem of stochastic partial differential equations in $C^{1,\sigma}$ open sets. We consider substantially large classes of nonlocal operators and generalized Gaussian noise.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model where the diffusion coefficient involves a state-dependent variable exponent function $p(\cdot)$. This new theoretically flexible framework generalizes the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. The existence, uniqueness, higher moment and martingale properties of solutions are analyzed. The validity and efficiency of the model is illustrated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Weak stability by noise for approximations of doubly nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly nonlinear stochastic evolution equations are considered. Upon assuming the additive noise to be rough enough, we prove the existence of probabilistically weak solutions of Friedrichs type and study their uniqueness in law. This entails stability for approximations of stochastic doubly nonlinear equations in a weak probabilistic sense. Such effect is a genuinely stochastic, as doubly nonlinear equations are not even expected to exhibit uniqueness in the deterministic case.</description>

      <title>A rough path approach to pathwise stochastic integration \`a la F\"ollmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for pathwise stochastic integration that extends F\"ollmer's classical approach beyond gradient-type integrands and standard left-point Riemann sums and provides pathwise counterparts of It\^o, Stratonovich, and backward It\^o integration. More precisely, for a continuous path admitting both quadratic variation and L\'evy area along a fixed sequence of partitions, we define pathwise stochastic integrals as limits of general Riemann sums and prove that they coincide with integrals defined with respect to suitable rough paths. Furthermore, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the quadratic variation and the L\'evy area of a continuous path are invariant with respect to the choice of partition sequences.</description>

      <title>Decoupling the i.i.d. field and the randomisation field in the Curie-Weiss model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the De Finetti representation of the Curie-Weiss model, the uniform coupling of Bernoulli random variables and the Laplace inversion formula (almost surely), we show that the full phase diagram of the Curie-Weiss model can be explained by a competition between the De Finetti randomisation and an approximate Gaussian process indexed by a complex variable that is equal to the inverse Laplace transform on a complex line of a Brownian Bridge. A more refined process type of rescaling shows that this is a modification of the Brownian Sheet that is at the core of all Gaussian random variables in the limits obtained in the model. This almost sure Laplace inversion approach allows moreover to treat all types of spin laws in the same vein as the Curie-Weiss Bernoulli spins.
  This gives a natural explanation of several results that already appeared in the literature in the subcritical and critical case in addition to produce new analogous results in the super-critical case.
  The functional approach here defined can moreover be extended to a wide class of statistical mechanical models that includes the Ising model in any dimension.</description>

      <title>On the minimal integral energy of majorants of the Wiener process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior (over long time intervals) of the minimal integral energy \[ |h|_T^\psi = \int_0^T \psi(h^\prime(t)) \, \mathrm{d}t \] of majorants of the Wiener process $ W(\cdot) $ satisfying the constraints $ h(0) = r $, $ h(t) \geq W(t) $ for $ 0 \leq t \leq T $. The results significantly generalize previous asymptotic estimates obtained for the case of kinetic energy $ \psi(u) = u^2 $, revealing that this case, where the minimal energy grows logarithmically, is a critical one, lying between two different asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear rough Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McKean-Vlasov SDEs describe systems where the dynamics depend on the law of the process. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is a nonlinear, nonlocal PDE for the corresponding measure flow. In the presence of common noise and conditional law dependence, the evolution becomes random and is governed by a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation; that is, a nonlinear, nonlocal SPDE in the space of measures. (Such equations constitute an important ingredient in the theory of mean-field games with common noise.) Well-posedness of such SPDEs is a difficult problem, the best result to date due to Coghi-Gess (2019), which however comes with dimension-dependent regularity assumptions. In the present work, we show how rough path techniques can circumvent these entirely. Hence, and somewhat contrarily to common believe, the use of rough paths leads to substantially less regularity demands on the coefficients than methods rooted in classical stochastic analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Quenched scaling limit for biased random walks on random, heavy tailed conductances: low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random walk amongst positive random conductances on $\mathbb{Z}^d, d \ge 2$, with directional bias. When the conductances have a stable distribution with parameter $\gamma \in (0, 1)$, the walk is sub-ballistic. In this regime Fribergh and Kious (Ann. Prob. 2018) derived an annealed scaling limit for the appropriately rescaled walk towards the Fractional Kinetics process. We prove the quenched version of this result for all $d \ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $M_n$ be an $n \times n$ random matrix with i.i.d. sparse discrete entries. In this paper, we develop a simple framework to solve the approximate Spielman-Teng theorem for $M_n$, which has the following form: There exist constants $C, c&gt;0$ such that for all $\eta \geq 0$, $\textbf{P}\left(s_n\left(M_n\right) \leq \eta\right) \lesssim n^C \eta+\exp \left(-n^c\right)$. As an application, we give an approximate Spielman-Teng theorem for $M_n$ whose entries are $\mu-$lazy random variables, extending previous work by Tao and Vu.</description>

      <title>Approximation Techniques for the Reconstruction of the Probability Measure and the Coupling Parameters in a Curie-Weiss Model for Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Curie-Weiss model, originally used to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics, has been adapted to model phenomena in social sciences where many agents interact with each other. Reconstructing the probability measure of a Curie-Weiss model via the maximum likelihood method runs into the problem of computing the partition function which scales exponentially with the population. We study the estimation of the coupling parameters of a multi-group Curie-Weiss model using large population asymptotic approximations for the relevant moments of the probability distribution in the case that there are no interactions between groups. As a result, we obtain an estimator which can be calculated at a low and constant computational cost for any size of the population. The estimator is consistent (under the added assumption that the population is large enough), asymptotically normal, and satisfies large deviation principles. The estimator is potentially useful in political science, sociology, automated voting, and in any application where the degree of social cohesion in a population has to be identified. The Curie-Weiss model's coupling parameters provide a natural measure of social cohesion. We discuss the problem of estimating the optimal weights in two-tier voting systems.</description>

      <title>The second fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the generalized Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the existence of (second order) stationary solutions of the generalized Langevin equation under appropriate assumptions on the associated memory kernel. When this stochastic equation is formulated as an initial value problem, then it is shown that the solution approaches a stationary process as time goes to infinity, whenever the fluctuating force term is taken to be a combination of a white noise process and a mean-square continuous centered stationary Gaussian process (which may be correlated with each other). The limiting process can be any centered stationary Gaussian process with sufficiently smooth spectral density. On the other hand, the solution itself is only stationary when the fluctuating force satisfies a certain fluctuation-dissipation relation, and this stationary solution is uniquely specified by its covariance.</description>

      <title>Analysing Models for Volatility Clustering with Subordinated Processes: VGSA and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a comprehensive class of time-changed stochastic processes constructed by subordinating Brownian motion with Levy processes, where the subordination is further governed by stochastic arrival mechanisms such as the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) and Chan Karolyi Longstaff Sanders (CKLS) processes. These models extend classical jump frameworks like the Variance Gamma (VG) and CGMY processes, allowing for more flexible modeling of market features such as jump clustering, heavy tails, and volatility persistence. We first revisit the theory of Levy subordinators and establish strong consistency results for the VG process under Gamma subordination. Building on this, we prove asymptotic normality for both the VG and VGSA (VG with stochastic arrival) processes when the arrival process follows CIR or CKLS dynamics. The analysis is then extended to the more general CGMY process under stochastic arrival, for which we derive analogous consistency and limit theorems under positivity and regularity conditions on the arrival process. A simulation study accompanies the theoretical work, confirming our results through Monte Carlo experiments, with visualizations and normality testing (via Shapiro-Wilk statistics) that show approximate Gaussian behavior even for processes driven by heavy-tailed jumps. This work provides a rigorous and unified probabilistic framework for analyzing subordinated models with stochastic time changes, with applications to financial modeling and inference under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.</description>

      <title>Time Deep Gradient Flow Method for pricing American options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we explore neural network-based methods for pricing multidimensional American put options under the BlackScholes and Heston model, extending up to five dimensions. We focus on two approaches: the Time Deep Gradient Flow (TDGF) method and the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). We extend the TDGF method to handle the free-boundary partial differential equation inherent in American options. We carefully design the sampling strategy during training to enhance performance. Both TDGF and DGM achieve high accuracy while outperforming conventional Monte Carlo methods in terms of computational speed. In particular, TDGF tends to be faster during training than DGM.</description>

      <title>The Joint Asymptotic Distribution of Entropy and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic distribution of ordinal-pattern frequencies under weak dependence conditions and investigate the long-run covariance matrix not only analytically for moving-average, Gaussian, and the novel generalized coin-tossing processes, but also approximately by a simulation-based approach. Then, we deduce the asymptotic distribution of the entropy-complexity pair, which emerged as a popular tool for summarizing the time-series dynamics. Here, we make the necessary distinction between a uniform and a non-uniform ordinal pattern distribution and, thus, obtain two different limit theorems. On this basis, we consider a test for serial dependence and check its finite-sample performance. Moreover, we use our asymptotic results to approximate the estimation uncertainty of entropy-complexity pairs.</description>

      <title>Spatially dense stochastic epidemic models with infection-age dependent infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an individual-based stochastic spatial epidemic model where the number of locations and the number of individuals at each location both grow to infinity. Each individual is associated with a random infection-age dependent infectivity function. Individuals are infected through interactions across the locations with heterogeneous effects. The epidemic dynamics can be described using a time-space representation for the the total force of infection, the number of susceptible individuals, the number of infected individuals that are infected at each time and have been infected for a certain amount of time, as well as the number of recovered individuals. We prove a functional law of large numbers for these time-space processes, and in the limit, we obtain a set of time-space integral equations. We then derive the PDE models from the limiting time-space integral equations, in particular, the density (with respect to the infection age) of the time-age-space integral equation for the number of infected individuals tracking the age of infection satisfies a linear PDE in time and age with an integral boundary condition. These integral equation and PDE limits can be regarded as dynamics on graphon under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Delayed Hawkes birth-death processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce, and formally establish, a variant of the Hawkes-fed birth-death process -- the delayed Hawkes birth-death process -- in which the conditional intensity does not increase at arrivals but at departures from the system. In a scaling limit where sojourn times are stretched out by a factor $\sqrt T$, after which time gets contracted by a factor $T$, the delayed Hawkes process behaves markedly differently from its classical counterpart. We design a family of models admitting a cluster representation and containing the Hawkes and delayed Hawkes processes as special cases. The cluster representation allows for transform characterizations by a fixed-point equation and for analysis of heavy-tailed asymptotics. We compare the delayed Hawkes process to the classical Hawkes process using stochastic ordering, which enables us to describe stationary distributions and heavy-traffic behavior. In the Markovian network case, a recursive procedure is presented to calculate the $d$th-order moments analytically.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for bulk deviations for the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the behavior of the continuous-time simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \geq 3$. We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the principal exponential rate of decay for the probability that the average value over a large box of some non-decreasing local function of the field of occupation times of the walk exceeds a given positive value. This bound matches at leading order the corresponding upper bound derived by Sznitman in arXiv:1906.05809, and is given in terms of a certain constrained minimum of the Dirichlet energy of functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ decaying at infinity. Our proof utilizes a version of tilted random walks, a model originally constructed by Li in arXiv:1412.3959 to derive lower bounds on the probability of the event that the trace of a simple random walk disconnects a macroscopic set from an enclosing box.</description>

      <title>Parameter dependent rough SDEs with applications to rough PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rough stochastic differential equations (rough SDEs), recently introduced by Friz, Hocquet and L\^e in arXiv:2106.10340, have emerged as a versatile tool to study "doubly" SDEs under partial conditioning (with motivation from pathwise filtering and control, volatility modelling in finance and mean-field stochastic dynamics with common noise ...). While the full dynamics may be highly non-Markovian, the conditional dynamics often are. In natural (and even linear) situations, the resulting stochastic PDEs can be beyond existing technology. The present work then tackles a key problem in this context, which is the well-posedness of regular solution to the rough Kolmogorov backward equation. To this end, we study parameter dependent rough SDEs in sense of $\mathscr{L}$-differentiability (as in Krylov, 2008). In companion works, we will show how this removes dimension-dependent regularity assumptions for well-posedness of the Zakai, Kushner-Stratonovich and nonlinear Fokker-Planck stochastic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) emerges as the scaling limit of directed polymers in random environments and the noise-mollified Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE), specifically at the critical dimension of two and near the critical temperature. The prior work Caravenna Sun Zygouras (2023) established the first construction of finite-dimensional distributions by demonstrating the universal (model-independent) convergence of discrete polymers. In this work, we present a new, independent approach to the SHF. We formulate the SHF as a continuous process and provide a set of axioms for its characterization. We establish both the uniqueness and existence of this process under our new formulation, with a key feature of these axioms being the matching of the first four moments.</description>

      <title>A large multi-agent system with noise both in position and control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a multi-population system where the dynamics of each agent evolve according to a system of stochastic differential equations in a general functional setup, determined by the global state of the system. Each agent is associated with a probability measure, that assigns the label accounting for the population to which the agent belongs. We do not assume any prior knowledge of the label of a single agent, and we allow that it can change as a consequence of the interaction among the agents. Furthermore, the system is affected by noise both in the agent's position and labels. First, we study the well-posedness of such a system and then a mean-field limit, as the number of agents diverges, is investigated together with the analysis of the properties of the limit distribution both with Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives. As an application, we consider a large network of interacting neurons with random synaptic weights, introducing resets in the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends classical probabilistic results to the broader class of demimartingales and demisubmartingales. We establish variants of Doob's-type optional sampling theorem under minimal structural conditions on stopping times, relying on monotonicity properties of indicator functions. Building on these foundations, we derive maximal inequalities and a concentration inequality of Azuma-Hoeffding-Bernstein type for demimartingales. A central limit theorem and a strong law of large numbers are also obtained demonstrating convergence under conditions considerably weaker than those required for martingales or independent sequences. These results are then applied to partial sums of positively associated random variables, yielding concentration inequalities and exponential bounds without requiring covariance decay or truncation arguments. The optional sampling theorems are used to establish Wald inequalities for positively associated random variables while the paper concludes with a strong law of large numbers for associated random variables, established under very mild conditions, highlighting the power of the demimartingale framework in handling dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing posterior functionals in general high-dimensional statistical models with possibly non-log-concave likelihood functions is considered. Based on the proof strategy of Nickl and Wang (2022), but using only local likelihood conditions and without relying on M-estimation theory, nonasymptotic statistical and computational guarantees are provided for a gradient based MCMC algorithm. Given a suitable initialiser, these guarantees scale polynomially in key algorithmic quantities. The abstract results are applied to several concrete statistical models, including density estimation, nonparametric regression with generalised linear models and a canonical statistical non-linear inverse problem from PDEs.</description>

      <title>Geometry and stability of species complexes: larger species speciate less often</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species complexes are groups of closely related populations exchanging genes through dispersal. We study the dynamics of the structure of species complexes in a class of metapopulation models where demes can exchange genetic material through migration and diverge through the accumulation of new mutations. Importantly, we model the ecological feedback of differentiation on gene flow by assuming that the success of migrations decreases with genetic distance, through a specific function $h$. We investigate the effects of metapopulation size on the coherence of species structures, depending on some mathematical characteristics of the feedback function $h$. Our results suggest that with larger metapopulation sizes, species form increasingly coherent, transitive, and uniform entities. We conclude that the initiation of speciation events in large species requires the existence of idiosyncratic geographic or selective restrictions on gene flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fully characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. In particular, we prove that the ratio between the perimeter and the area (i.e., the number of vertices) of this set of minimal shapes converges to the isoperimetric constant computed in H\"aggstr\"om-Jonasson-Lyons. In fact, our balls which are constructed via layers and not combinatorial balls, will realize the isoperimetric constant for any fixed number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and propagation of chaos for multi-agent models with strategies and diffusive effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-agent model for individuals endowed with strategies and subject to diffusive effects is proposed. The microscopic state of each agent is described by a spatial position and a probability measure, interpreted as a mixed strategy, over a compact metric space. The evolution is governed by a non-local interaction mechanism and by stochastic effects acting on the spatial component of the state. The well-posedness of the multi-agent system and that of a certain McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equation are proved. Eventually, a propagation of chaos result is obtained, which guarantees that the former model converges to the latter as the number of agents goes to infinity.</description>
