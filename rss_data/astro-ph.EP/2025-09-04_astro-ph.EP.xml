      <title>Multi-band Spectral and Astrometric Characterization of the HIP 99770 b Planet with SCExAO/CHARIS and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze follow-up, higher resolution ($R$ $\sim$ 70) $H$ and $K$ band integral field spectroscopy of the superjovian exoplanet HIP 99770 b with SCExAO/CHARIS. Our new data recover the companion at a high signal-to-noise ratio in both bandpasses and more than double the astrometric baseline for its orbital motion. Jointly modeling HIP 99770 b's position and the star's astrometry from \textit{Hipparcos} and \textit{Gaia} yields orbital parameters consistent with those from the discovery paper, albeit with smaller errors, and a slight preference for a smaller semimajor axis ($\sim$15.7--15.8 au)and a larger eccentricity ($\sim$0.28--0.29), disfavoring a circular orbit. We revise its dynamical mass slightly downwards to 15.0$_{-4.4}^{+4.5}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a flat prior and 13.1$_{-5.2}^{+4.8}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a more standard log-uniform mass prior, where the inclusion of its relative radial-velocity measurement is primarily responsible for these changes. \textcolor{red}{We find consistent results for HIP 99770 b's dynamical mass including recent VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry, albeit with a slightly smaller, better constrained eccentricity of $e$ $\sim$ 0.22$^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$}. HIP 99770 b is a $\sim$ 1300 K object at the L/T transition with a gravity intermediate between that of the HR 8799 planets and older, more massive field brown dwarfs with similar temperatures but with hints of equilibrium chemistry. HIP 99770 b is particularly well suited for spectroscopic follow up with Roman CGI during the technology demonstration phase at 730 nm to further constrain its metallicity and chemistry; JWST thermal infrared observations could likewise explore the planet's carbon chemistry, metallicity, and clouds.</description>

      <title>Migration and Evolution of giant ExoPlanets (MEEP) II: Super-Jupiters and Lithium-rich Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although hot Jupiters were the first exoplanets discovered orbiting main sequence stars, the dominant mechanisms through which they form and evolve are not known. To address the questions surrounding their origins, the Migration and Evolution of giant ExoPlanets (MEEP) survey aims to create a complete, magnitude-limited ($G&lt;$12.5) sample of hot Jupiters that can be used to constrain the frequency of different migration pathways. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite provides the unique combination of sky-coverage and photometric precision to achieve this goal, which will likely be a key result of the mission. In this second installment of the MEEP survey, we reanalyze one benchmark hot Jupiter system, TOI-4138, and discover four additional super-Jupiters which are each more than five times as massive as Jupiter: TOI-4773 b, TOI-5261 b, TOI-5350 b, and TOI-6420 b. One of these planets, TOI-5261 b, is 11.49 times the mass of Jupiter, nearly massive enough to ignite deuterium fusion, and has an eccentric ($e = 0.1585$) orbit. TOI-4138, TOI-4773, TOI-5350, and TOI-6420 each have lithium absorption features in their spectra. TOI-4138 is an F-type subgiant with a lithium equivalent width of $120. \pm 13$ m\r{A}, which is $\sim 4.5\sigma$ larger than the median lithium equivalent width of a control sample of 1381 similar stars, making TOI-4138 a compelling candidate for planetary engulfment.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Rotation in the (120347) Salacia-Actaea System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on roughly 16 years of photometric monitoring of the transneptunian binary system (120347) Salacia-Actaea which provides significant evidence that Salacia and Actaea are tidally locked to the mutual orbital period in a fully synchronous configuration. The orbit of Actaea is updated, followed by a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of the ground-based photometry which reveals a synodic period similar to the orbital period and a peak-to-peak lightcurve amplitude of {\delta}m = 0.0900 {\pm} 0.0036 mag (1{\sigma} uncertainty). Incorporating archival HST photometry that resolves each component, we argue that the periodicity in the unresolved data is driven by a longitudinally varying surface morphology on Salacia, and derive a sidereal rotation period that is within 1{\sigma} of the mutual orbital period. A rudimentary tidal evolution model is invoked that suggests synchronization occurred within 1.1 Gyr after Actaea was captured/formed.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Cold Jupiters in the Formation of Close-in planets. II. Collisional Growth of Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet observations have shown that the occurrence and orbital architectures of close-in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are shaped by the presence of outer gas giant planets. This influence may emerge during the formation stage or from later dynamical evolution by a yet elusive physical process. In this work, we investigate the early stages of planetesimal accretion, modeling the joint collisional and dynamical evolution of planetesimals under the gravitational influence of a cold Jupiter and a viscously-dissipating massive protoplanetary disk. We find that an initially extended planetesimal disk of small ($\sim 1-10$ km) bodies evolves into massive, compact ($\Delta a/a\lesssim 0.1$) rings of several Earth masses in Moon-sized objects centered at $\sim0.1-0.5$ au. This prevalent outcome is the result of an initial stage of planetesimal accretion over the first 10 kyrs, followed by orbital transport driven by a secular apsidal resonance sweeping inward on Myr timescales. Our findings highlight the crucial role of giant planets in redistributing solids within the inner disk. This redistribution of planetary building blocks may help explain why systems with giant companions often depart from the "peas-in-a-pod" architecture.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Jupiter's Vertical Motions with the Observed Cloud Structure in the Upper Troposphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eddy fluxes of angular momentum in Jupiter's upper troposphere are known to converge in prograde jets and diverge in retrograde jets. Away from the equator, this implies convergence of the Eulerian mean meridional flow in zones (anticyclonic shear) and divergence in belts (cyclonic shear). It indicates lower-tropospheric downwelling in zones and upwelling in belts because the mean meridional circulation almost certainly closes at depth. Yet the observed banded structure of Jupiter's clouds and hazes suggests that there is upwelling in the brighter zones and downwelling in the darker belts. Here, we show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by considering not the Eulerian but the transformed Eulerian mean circulation, which includes a Stokes drift owing to eddies and is a better approximation of the Lagrangian mean transport of tracers such as ammonia. The potential vorticity structure inferred from observations paired with mixing length arguments suggests that there is transformed Eulerian mean upwelling in zones and downwelling in belts. Simulations with a global circulation model of Jupiter's upper atmosphere demonstrate the plausibility of these inferences and allow us to speculate on the band structure at deeper levels.</description>

      <title>Near-Discovery SOAR Photometry of the Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS was discovered on UT 2025 July 1 and joins a limited but growing population of detected $\sim10^2-10^3$ m scale interstellar objects. In this paper we report photometric observations of 3I/ATLAS from the nights of UT 2025 July 3, UT 2025 July 9, and UT 2025 July 10 obtained with the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR). The photometric observations are taken with the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (HTS) in the $r'$-band. These data provide 28 photometric data points to the rapidly growing composite light curve of 3I/ATLAS. They reveal that the object did not exhibit obvious long-term variability in its brightness when these observations were taken. These observations appear to have captured two moderate and independent brightening events on UT 2025 July 9, and UT 2025 July 10. However, we perform a series of stellar contamination, stacking, and aperture experiments that demonstrate that the increases in brightness by $\sim0.8$ magnitudes appear to be a result of poor seeing and stellar contamination by close-proximity field stars. We report the mean brightnesses of 3I/ATLAS on each night of magnitude 18.14, 17.55, and 17.54 for UT 2025 July 3, 9, and 10, respectively. Moreover, the presence of cometary activity in extant images obtained contemporaneously with these data precludes them from revealing insights into the rotation of the nucleus. We conclude that the activity of 3I/ATLAS on UT 2025 July 9 and UT July 10 was consistent with the near-discovery activity levels, with no obvious outburst activity.</description>

      <title>High Resolution ALMA Data of the Fomalhaut Debris Disk Confirms Apsidal Width Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present long-baseline observations of the Fomalhaut outer debris disk at 223 GHz (1.3 mm) from ALMA Cycle 5, which we use along with archival short-baseline observations to produce a 0".57 resolution mosaic of the disk at a sensitivity of 7 $\mu$Jy/bm. We use radial profiles to measure the disk at the ansae and find that the southeast (SE) side of the disk is 4 AU wider than the northwest (NW) side as observed by ALMA. We also find that the peak brightness of the NW ansa is $21\pm1\%$ brighter than the SE ansa. We perform MCMC fits of the ALMA visibilities using two analytical, eccentric disk models. Our results suggest that the model including a dispersion parameter for the proper eccentricity ($\sigma_{e_p}$), which accounts for additional scatter in the eccentricity of individual orbits, is preferred over the model without one. Such a model implies that self-gravitation, particle collisions, and close-packing could play a role in shaping the overall structure of the Fomalhaut disk as is seen in eccentric planetary rings. Crucially, neither model can reproduce the brightness or width asymmetry near the NW ansa. No emission from the Intermediate Belt is detected, allowing us to place a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 396 $\mu$Jy at 1.3 mm. We also discover a spectral line in archival Cycle 3 data centered at $\nu_{\rm obs}\approx230.25$ GHz at the location of the ``Great Dust Cloud," whose redshift from the expected CO line for Fomalhaut confirms the source is a background galaxy.</description>

      <title>Observational Tests of Terrestrial Planet Buffering Feedbacks and the Habitable Zone Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The habitable zone is defined as the orbital region around a star where planetary feedback cycles buffer atmospheric greenhouse gases that, in combination with solar luminosity, maintain surface temperatures suitable for liquid water. Evidence supports the existence of buffering feedbacks on Earth, but whether these same feedbacks are active on other Earth-like planets remains untested, as does the habitable zone hypothesis. While feedbacks are central to the habitable zone concept, one does not guarantee the other-i.e., it is possible that a planet may maintain stable surface conditions at a given solar luminosity without following the predicted $CO_2$ trend across the entire habitable zone. Forthcoming exoplanet observations will provide an opportunity to test both ideas. In anticipation of this and to avoid premature conclusions based on insufficient data, we develop statistical tests to determine how many observations are needed to detect and quantify planetary-scale feedbacks. Our model-agnostic approach assumes only the most generic prediction that holds for any buffering feedback, allowing the observations to constrain feedback behavior. That can then inform next-level questions about what specific physical, chemical, and/or biological feedback processes may be consistent with observational data. We find that [23, 74](95% CI) observations are required to detect feedback behavior within a given solar luminosity range, depending on the sampling order of planets. These results are from tests using conservative error tolerance-a measure used to capture the risk of false positives. Reducing error tolerance lowers the chance of false positives but requires more observations; increasing it reduces the required sample size but raises uncertainty in estimating population characteristics. We discuss these trade-offs and their implications for testing the habitable zone hypothesis.</description>

      <title>ALMA Reveals an Eccentricity Gradient in the Fomalhaut Debris Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence of a negative eccentricity gradient in the debris disk of the nearby A-type main sequence star, Fomalhaut. Fitting to the high-resolution, archival ALMA 1.32 mm continuum data for Fomalhaut (with a synthesised angular resolution of $0.76{\times}0.55''$; 4-6\,au), we present a model that describes the bulk properties of the disk (semi-major axis, width, and geometry) and its asymmetric morphology. The best-fit model incorporates a forced eccentricity gradient that varies with semi-major axis, $e_f\propto a^{n_\mathrm{pow}}$, a generalized form of the parametric models of Lynch &amp; Lovell 2022, with $n_\mathrm{pow}{=}{-1.75}{\pm}0.16$. We show that this model is statistically preferred to models with constant forced and free eccentricities. In comparison to disk models with constant forced eccentricities, negative eccentricity gradient models broaden disk widths at pericenter versus apocenter, and increase disk surface densities at apocenter versus pericenter, both of which are seen in the Fomalhaut disk, and which we collectively term Eccentric Velocity Divergence. We propose single-planet architectures consistent with the model and investigate the stability of the disk over 440 Myr to planet-disk interactions via N-body modeling. We find that Fomalhaut's ring eccentricity plausibly formed during the protoplanetary disk stage, with subsequent planet-disk interactions responsible for carving the disk morphology.</description>

      <title>Implementing the PRIDE technique for the JUICE mission at the University of Tasmania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission to study the Jovian system, currently undergoing an eight-year cruise phase. The Planetary Radio Interferometric and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) is one of eleven experiments contributing to the JUICE mission. PRIDE aims to conduct radio science experiments using ground-based radio telescopes, through both single dish and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. The University of Tasmania (UTAS) is an important contributor to PRIDE and JUICE, though its continental-wide network of radio telescopes in Australia. Over 35 PRIDE observations of JUICE were conducted during the period 2023-24, which enabled detailed analysis of space weather activity in this period, as well as the Lunar-Earth flyby campaign in August 2024. In this paper, we describe PRIDE VLBI observations of JUICE, and the first successful results of PRIDE with the University of Tasmania infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric CO2 Ice in the Martian Polar Regions: Physical and Spectral Properties From Mars Climate Sounder Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice clouds are important for polar energy balance and the carbon dioxide cycle on Mars. However, uncertainties remain regarding their physical and radiative properties, which control how polar $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ clouds interact with the global Martian climate. Here, we use Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) observations of atmospheric radiance to estimate these physical and radiative properties. We find that Martian $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ clouds are typically composed of large particles from a narrow size distribution with an effective radius of 46 $\mu$m and an effective variance of $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ in the southern hemisphere, and an effective radius of 42 $\mu$m and an effective variance of $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ in the north. The similarity in sizes of $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice particles in both hemispheres may be due to the fact that $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ clouds tend to form near the same pressure level in each hemisphere, despite the higher surface pressures in the north. We use a simplified convective cooling model to show that the small effective variance we derive may be a consequence of the fact that $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ is also the dominant atmospheric constituent on Mars, which allows $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice particles to reach sizes upwards of 10 $\mu$m within seconds. At the same time, the fact that the Martian atmosphere is so thin means that large particles fall rapidly to the surface, reducing the range of particle sizes that can remain in the atmosphere for any extended period of time. This study is part of ongoing work to add $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice opacity profiles to the MCS retrieval pipeline.</description>

      <title>A second low-mass planet orbiting the nearby M-dwarf GJ 536</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GJ 536 is a low-mass star, located 10 pc away from the Sun, that hosts a low-mass planet orbiting with a period of 8.71 days. Based on an analysis of the radial velocity (RV) time series obtained from the available data of the spectrographs HARPS, HARPS-N, CARMENES and HIRES, we announce the discovery of a second low-mass planet orbiting the star. We performed a RV global analysis on RV, spectroscopic activity indicators, and ASAS photometry, within the multidimensional Gaussian process framework, updated the parameters of GJ 536 b, and found significant evidence of the presence of a second planet. GJ 536 c is a low-mass planet ($m_{p} \sin i$ = 5.89 $\pm$ 0.70 M$_{\oplus}$), orbiting with a period of 32.761 $\pm$ 0.015 days, at a distance of 0.1617 $\pm$ 0.0028 au from its parent star. It induces an RV semi-amplitude of 1.80 $\pm$ 0.20 m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. Given its distance to the star, it receives a flux of 1.692 $\pm$ 0.069 F$_{\oplus}$, for an equilibrium temperature of 290.5 $\pm$ 9.5 K. We update the mass of the planet GJ 536 b to $m_{p} \sin i$ = 6.37 $\pm$ 0.38 M$_{\oplus}$. The orbits of both planets are consistent with circular. We explored the use of statistical Doppler imaging on the photometric and RV data, and find a tentative projected obliquity of the stellar rotation axis of 58$^{+16}_{-19}$ deg. Current evidence does not support the presence of additional planets with masses &gt; 5 M$_{\oplus}$for orbital periods up to 100 days, or &gt; 10 M$_{\oplus}$ for periods up to 1000 days.</description>

      <title>Optimising reference library selection for reference-star differential imaging of discs with SPHERE/IRDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct detection of circumstellar discs through high-contrast imaging provides key insights into the history and dynamics of planetary systems. Pole-on discs, especially faint debris discs, are difficult to detect and require careful consideration during post-processing to remove stellar residuals from the data while preserving the disc signal. Reference-star differential imaging (RDI) serves as one of the primary post-processing methods for disc observations. We aim to develop a method of reference frame selection that is optimised for the reduction of pole-on discs. Method: We performed principal component analysis based RDI on seven known disc targets and 20 disc-free targets with varying observational conditions, using reference libraries built from frames preselected to best match different observational, atmospheric, and stellar parameters of the science frames. The contrast of the disc-free reductions was measured, and forward modelling was used to estimate the signal loss from over-subtraction using synthetic pole-on discs with two different widths and four different radii. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the real disc targets was measured. Results: Diverse reference libraries built using subsets of frames that closely matched different parameters achieved the best disc S/N and smallest deviation from the best contrast of each target, outperforming libraries built using a single criterion as a selection metric. Libraries built using frame-to-frame Pearson correlation coefficient alone as a selection criterion achieved the best mean contrast overall. Both selection metrics performed consistently well for all disc radii and observational conditions. We also found that reference libraries built using frames observed close in time to the science frame performed well for discs at small separations, giving the best contrast for ~30% of the targets at a radius of 20px.</description>

      <title>Creation of Lunar-Like Rims in Ilmenite using Synthetic Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weathering of lunar minerals, due to bombardment from solar wind (SW) particles and micrometeoroid impacts, modifies the mineralogy within tens of nanometers of the surface, i.e., the rim. Via remote sensing, spectroscopic signatures of these modifications have long been used to gauge surface exposure times on the Moon. However, the relative contributions of the solar wind and micrometeroids in the creation of rim features are still debated, particularly for the few-nm clusters known as nanophase iron (npFe$^0$), which commonly form in ferrous minerals. We address this issue in the laboratory, using deuterium ions and low-energy electrons as a synthetic solar wind plasma to irradiate ilmenite FeTiO$_3$), a common lunar mineral. Characterization by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy shows that the solar wind alone creates rims with all the main characteristics of lunar samples. We conclusively identify npFe$^0$ and quantify its distribution as a function of depth and fluence, allowing us to estimate the SW exposure of Apollo soil 71501. Our results confirm that small npFe$^0$ (&lt;10 nm in diameter) form due to the solar wind. Similar experiments could provide microscopic details of space weathering, improving the link between surface modification processes and macroscopic remote sensing data.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen chemistry of hycean worlds on the example of K2-18b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent observation of the exoplanet K2-18b sparked interest among scientists - large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane were detected in an H2-rich background atmosphere. If the planet is a hycean world (liquid water ocean + hydrogen-dominated atmosphere), it could be habitable under certain conditions. The presence of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen was already confirmed, however, there was no detection of nitrogen or its compounds. Molecular nitrogen is difficult to detect directly. This study concentrates on possible photochemical products of N2 such as HCN, NH3 and HC3N. We set approximate limits on the amount of nitrogen bearing species by varying atmospheric parameters, such as the Eddy Diffusion coefficient and the amount of N2 present from 10 ppm to 10%. If the bulk nitrogen-containing gas in the atmosphere is N2, photochemistry produces only trace amounts of the aforementioned species. However, if ammonia is the main source of nitrogen, then the quantities of NH3, CH5N and HCN approach detectable range. HC3N and NO are bad tracers of the nitrogen source in the atmosphere, because they are produced in similar amounts in all tested scenarios. Assuming equilibrium chemistry at the surface of K2-18b results in underprediction of CO2 abundance. This result combined with the non-detection of ammonia by JWST suggests the planet is not a typical sub-Neptune, but could be indeed a hycean world or magma ocean planet. We also found that C2H6 is produced in significant amounts - if it is detected in the future, it could serve as a proxy for DMS presence.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. III. Detectability of Giant Exomoons of Wide Separation Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will conduct a Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) to discover bound and free-floating exoplanets using gravitational microlensing. Roman should be sensitive to lenses with mass down to ~ 0.02 $M_{\oplus}$, or roughly the mass of Ganymede. Thus the detection of moons with masses similar to the giant moons in our Solar System is possible with Roman. Measuring the demographics of exomoons will provide constraints on both moon and planet formation. We conduct simulations of Roman microlensing events to determine the effects of exomoons on microlensing light curves, and whether these effects are detectable with Roman. We focus on giant planets from 30 $M_{\oplus}$ to 10 $M_{Jup}$ on orbits from 0.3 to 30 AU, and assume that each planet is orbited by a moon with moon-planet mass ratio from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ and separations from 0.1 to 0.5 planet Hill radii. We find that Roman is sensitive to exomoons, although the number of expected detections is only of order one over the duration of the survey, unless exomoons are more common or massive than we assumed. We argue that changes in the survey strategy, in particular focusing on a few fields with higher cadence, may allow for the detection of more exomoons with Roman. Regardless, the ability to detect exomoons reinforces the need to develop robust methods for modeling triple lens microlensing events to fully utilize the capabilities of Roman.</description>

      <title>On the synergetic use of Ariel and JWST for exoplanet atmospheric science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This white paper explores the potential for strategic synergies between the JWST and the Ariel telescopes, two flagship observatories poised to revolutionise the study of exoplanet atmospheres. Both telescopes have the potential to address common fundamental questions about exoplanets-especially concerning their nature and origins-and serve a growing scientific community. With their operations now anticipated to overlap, starting from 2030, there is a unique opportunity to enhance the scientific outputs of both observatories through coordinated efforts.
  In this report, authored by the Ariel-JWST Synergy Working Group, part of the Ariel Consortium Science Team, we summarise the capabilities of JWST and Ariel; we highlight their key differences, similarities, synergies, and distinctive strengths. Ariel is designed to conduct a broad survey of exoplanet atmospheres but remains highly flexible, allowing the mission to integrate insights from JWST's discoveries. Findings from JWST, including data from initiatives shaped by NASA's decadal survey priorities and community-driven research themes, will inform the development of Ariel's core survey strategy. Conversely, Ariel's ability to perform broad-wavelength coverage observations for bright targets provides complementary avenues for exoplanet researchers, particularly those interested in time-domain observations and large-scale atmospheric studies.
  This paper identifies key pathways for fostering JWST-Ariel synergies, many of which can be initiated even before Ariel's launch. Leveraging their complementary designs and scopes, JWST and Ariel can jointly address fundamental questions about the nature, formation, and evolution of exoplanets. Such strategic collaboration has the potential to maximise the scientific returns of both observatories and lay the foundation for future facilities in the roadmap to exoplanet exploration.</description>

      <title>A Striking First Impression: CGI Commissioning Observations of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For one of the first set of Roman Coronagraph project images, we propose to target AB Aurigae. AB Aurigae is a complex and visually stunning system, surrounded by a gas rich protoplanetary disk showing numerous spiral arms, an enigmatic embedded protoplanet (AB Aurigae b) at 0\farcs{}6 separation, and hints of potential additional sites of planet formation. Even a marginally-successful dark hole generation (e.g. 10$^{-5}$--10$^{-6}$ contrast) with CGI would yield a vastly improved view of AB Aur b at optical wavelengths where current ground-based and HST data struggle to yield a high SNR detection and parameters (astrometry, photometry) unbiased by processing artifacts. Total intensity imaging and polarimetry together will provide new constraints on the disk's dust properties and the range of emission sources for AB Aur b. AB Aur images with the Roman Coronagraph will provide a striking, inspiring demonstrations of the instrument's power and promise for detecting fainter planets and disks.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution of Quasi-Hierarchical Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational dynamics of quasi-hierarchical triple systems, where the outer orbital period is significantly longer than the inner one, but the outer orbit is extremely eccentric, rendering the time at pericentre comparable to the inner period. Such systems are not amenable to the standard techniques of perturbation theory and orbit-averaging. Modelling the evolution of these triples as a sequence of impulses at the outer pericentre, we show that such triples lend themselves to a description as a correlated random walk of the inner binary's eccentricity and angular-momentum vector, going beyond the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism. The outer orbit is seen to excite the inner eccentricity arbitrarily close to unity, eventually. These quasi-hierarchical triples constitute, therefore, a natural mechanism for creating highly eccentric binaries. We discuss applications for gravitational-wave mergers engendered by this process, and show that for a large portion of the parameter space, the time-to-coalescence is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Sky Survey Schedule (SSS) framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated intelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation scheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates coordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising dozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and time-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation modes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for sidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up capabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude bands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and comprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky grids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At the core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates multiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital catalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging requirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback mechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved targets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or lost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights combine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar interference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time priority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates operator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable weight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....</description>

      <title>Alpha effect in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear in astrophysical clouds and discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combined effect of the density-stratified turbulence and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers causes the alpha effect and the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. This results in generation of the large-scale magnetic field in colliding protogalactic clouds, merging protostellar clouds and protoplanetary discs. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions caused by the inhomogeneity of turbulence to the $\alpha$ tensor and effective pumping velocity. The isotropic part of the alpha tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field caused by product of the fluid density stratification and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity due to collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. However, the alpha tensor is independent of the effects of collapsing or expanding of clouds.</description>

      <title>Stellar-activity analysis of the nearby M dwarf GJ 526. Multi-dimensional Gaussian-process modelling of RV, FWHM and S-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy, and their low masses make them natural favourites for exoplanet radial-velocity (RV) searches. Nevertheless, these stars often demonstrate strong stellar activity that is yet to be fully understood. We use high-precision ESPRESSO, HIRES, and HARPS spectroscopy to perform a stellar-activity analysis on the nearby early M dwarf GJ 526 ($d=5.4$ pc). We carry out joint modelling of: (i) stellar rotation in RV, FWHM, and Mount Wilson S-index through Gaussian processes, (ii) long-term trends in these three physical quantities, (iii) RV planetary signals. We constrain the stellar-rotation period to $P_\text{rot}=48.7\pm 0.3$ d, and discover a weak sinusoidal signature in RV, FWHM and S-index of period $P_\text{cyc}=1680^{+50}_{-40}$ d. We propose phase-space trajectories between RV and activity indicators as a novel means to visualise and interpret stellar activity. Current evidence does not support planetary companions of GJ 526.</description>

      <title>Search for Past Stellar Encounters and the Origin of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity. To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.</description>

Abstract: The ongoing discussion about the atomic chemical composition of the Sun is commented on. The main focus in this review is on the deviation of the solar composition from that of most other solar-type stars in that its ratio of volatiles (like the elements C, N, O, S, P and Zn) to the refractories (most metals, like Ba, Ca, Ti, Y, Al, Sc and Zr) tends to be higher in the Sun by 10 to 20%. What does this tell about the formation and evolution of the Solar System? Scenarios in terms of galactic evolution, formation of the pre-solar nebula, of the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, of the engulfing of planets, and of other processes within the Solar System are considered, as well as the evolution of binary stars with similarly different chemical composition. Finally, implications, if any, on the habitability of the Solar System are commented on.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Compiling Exoatmospheric Target Lists And Quantifying the Ground-Based Resources Needed to Vet Them</title>

Abstract: Transiting exoplanet atmospheric characterization is currently in a golden age as dozens of exoplanet atmospheres are being studied by NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. This trend is expected to continue with NASA's Pandora Smallsat and Roman Space Telescope and ESA's Ariel mission (all expected to launch within this decade) and NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (expected to launch in the early 2040s) all of which are centered around studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. Here we explore a new approach to constructing large scale exoatmospheric survey lists, which combines the use of traditional transmission/emission spectroscopy figures of merit with a focus on more-evenly sampling planets across a range of radii and equilibrium temperatures. After assembling a sample target list comprised of 750 transmission spectroscopy targets and 150 emission spectroscopy targets, we quantify the potential time lost to stale transit and eclipse ephemerides and find that hundreds of hours of space-based observing could be wasted given current uncertainties in orbital periods, transit epochs, and orbital eccentricities. We further estimate the amount of ground-based telescope time necessary to obtain sufficiently precise exoplanet masses and find that it exceeds 100 nights of 10m telescope time. Based upon these findings, we provide a list of recommendations that would make community efforts for preparation and interpretation of atmospheric characterization endeavors more effective and efficient. The strategies we recommend here can be used to support both current (e.g., HST and JWST) and future exoplanet atmosphere characterization missions (e.g., Pandora, Ariel, Roman, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory).</description>

      <title>3D Simulations of Convective Entrainment in Gas Giants: Rotation and Decreasing Luminosity as Barriers to Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00364</link>

Abstract: Observations from Juno and Cassini suggest that Jupiter and Saturn may possess fuzzy cores -- central regions where the abundance of heavy elements varies smoothly with depth. Such gradients pose a longstanding puzzle for models of planetary evolution and formation, which predict that vigorous convection would homogenize the interior of gas giants within the first $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{years}$ of cooling. Previous 3D simulations and analytic predictions for the propagation of a convection zone into a stable region have demonstrated that the rapid rotation of gas giants can significantly slow convective mixing, but not enough to stop it. Another piece of the puzzle is luminosity. Gas giants cool as they age, and with that comes a declining heat flux over time. Recent ideas suggest that when this declining luminosity is combined with rotational effects, convection may stall. We explore this possibility using 3D hydrodynamic simulations that include both rotation and a surface cooling flux that decreases as $1/t$. Our results demonstrate that, even without rotation, a declining luminosity can suppress mixing sufficiently to preserve an initial compositional gradient in the deep interior of gas giants. If confirmed by more realistic simulations, this may help to explain the long-term survival of fuzzy cores.</description>
