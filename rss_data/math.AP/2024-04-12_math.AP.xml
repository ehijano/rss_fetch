      <title>Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Field Dislocation Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fully nonlinear (geometric and material) system of Field Dislocation Mechanics is reviewed to establish an exact analogy with the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (ideal MHD) under suitable physically simplifying circumstances. Weak solutions with various conservation properties have been established for ideal MHD recently by Faraco, Lindberg, and Szekelyhidi using the techniques of compensated compactness of Tartar and Murat and convex integration; by the established analogy, these results would seem to be transferable to the idealization of Field Dislocation Mechanics considered. A dual variational principle is designed and discussed for this system of PDE, with the technique transferable to the study of MHD as well.</description>

      <title>Brock-type isoperimetric inequality for Steklov eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by imposing suitable assumptions on the weighted function, (under the constraint of fixed weighted volume) a Brock-type isoperimetric inequality for Steklov-type eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic space has been proven. This conclusion is actually an interesting extension of F. Brock's classical result about the isoperimetric inequality for Steklov eigenvalues of the Laplacian given in the influential paper [Z. Angew. Math. Mech. 81 (2001) 69-71]. Besides, a related open problem has also been proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. The existence and uniqueness of a spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, is first proved by I. Hashimoto and A. Matsumura in 2021. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. Moreover, we also derive a set of decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the long time stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ under small initial perturbations using the energy method. The main difficulty for this is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Existence results for problems involving non local operator with an asymmetric weight and with a critical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a great attention has been focused on the study of fractional and non-local operators of elliptic type, both for the pure mathematical research and in view of concrete real-world applications. We consider the following non local problem on $\mathbb{H}_0^s(\Omega) \subset L^{q_s}(\Omega)$, with $q_s :=\frac{2n}{n-2s}$, $s\in ]0, 1[$ and $n\geq 3$ \begin{equation}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}p(x) \bigg(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^2}{|x-y|^{n+2s}}dy\bigg)dx-\lambda \int_\Omega |u(x)|^q dx, \qquad(1)\end{equation} where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n, p :\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a given positive weight presenting a global minimum $p_0 &gt;0$ at $a \in \Omega$ and $\lambda$ is a real constant. In this work we show that for $q=2$ the infimum of (1) over the set $\{u\in \mathbb{H}_0^s(\Omega), ||u||_{L^{q_s}(\Omega)}=1\}$ does exist for some $k, s, \lambda$ and $n$ and for $q\geq 2$ we study non ground state solutions using the Mountain Pass Theorem.</description>

      <title>Reduced-dimensional modelling for nonlinear convection-dominated flow in cylindric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to construct and justify asymptotic approximations for solutions to quasilinear convection-diffusion problems with a predominance of nonlinear convective flow in a thin cylinder, where an inhomogeneous nonlinear Robin-type boundary condition involving convective and diffusive fluxes is imposed on the lateral surface. The limit problem for vanishing diffusion and the cylinder shrinking to an interval is a nonlinear first-order conservation law. For a time span that allows for a classical solution of this limit problem corresponding uniform pointwise and energy estimates are proven. They provide precise model error estimates with respect to the small parameter that controls the double viscosity-geometric limit. In addition, other problems with more higher P\'eclet numbers are also considered.</description>

      <title>Non-homogeneous fourth order elliptic inequalities with a convolution term motivated by the suspension bridge problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the study of the twin non-local inequalities featuring non-homogeneous differential operators $$\displaystyle -\Delta^2 u + \lambda\Delta u \geq (K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p)u^q \quad\text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N (N\geq 1),$$ and $$\displaystyle \Delta^2 u - \lambda\Delta u \geq (K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p)u^q \quad\text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N (N\geq 1),$$ with parameters $\lambda, p, q &gt;0$, $0\leq \alpha \leq N$ and $\beta&gt;\alpha-N$. In the above inequalities the potential $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ is given by $K_{\alpha, \beta}(x) = |x|^{-\alpha}\log^{\beta}(1 + |x|)$ while $K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p$ denotes the standard convolution operator in $\mathbb{R}^N$. We discuss the existence and non-existence of non-negative solutions in terms of $N, p, q, \lambda, \alpha$ and $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Lower semicontinuity and existence results for anisotropic TV functionals with signed measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimization of anisotropic total variation functionals with additional measure terms among functions of bounded variation subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition. More specifically, we identify and characterize certain isoperimetric conditions, which prove to be sharp assumptions on the signed measure data in connection with semicontinuity, existence, and relaxation results. Furthermore, we present a variety of examples which elucidate our assumptions and results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global regularity problem for the 2D Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard equations with logarithmic supercritical dissipation. By exploiting a combined quantity of the system, the technique of Littlewood-Paley decomposition and Besov spaces, and some commutator estimates, we establish the global regularity of a strong solution to this equations in the Sobolev space $H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ for $s \ge2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the $\dot{H}^{1}$--level exact controllability for the defocusing critical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Firstly, we show the problem under consideration to be well-posed using Strichartz estimates. Moreover, through the Hilbert uniqueness method, we prove the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation to be controllable. Finally, we use a perturbation argument and show local exact controllability for the critical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation.</description>

      <title>The limit as $s\nearrow 1$ of the fractional convex envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the fractional convexity when the fractional parameter goes to 1. For any notion of convexity, the convex envelope of a datum prescribed on the boundary of a domain is defined as the largest possible convex function inside the domain that is below the datum on the boundary. Here we prove that the fractional convex envelope inside a strictly convex domain of a continuous and bounded exterior datum converges when $s\nearrow 1$ to the classical convex envelope of the restriction to the boundary of the exterior datum.</description>

      <title>The Cattaneo-Christov approximation of Fourier heat-conductive compressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Navier-Stokes-Cattaneo-Christov (NSC) system in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq3$), a model of heat-conductive compressible flows serving as a finite speed of propagation approximation of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) system. Due to the presence of Oldroyd's upper-convected derivatives, the system (NSC) exhibits a \textit{lack of hyperbolicity} which makes it challenging to establish its well-posedness, especially in multi-dimensional contexts. In this paper, within a critical regularity functional framework, we prove the global-in-time well-posedness of (NSC) for initial data that are small perturbations of constant equilibria, uniformly with respect to the approximation parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Then, building upon this result, we obtain the sharp large-time asymptotic behaviour of (NSC) and, for all time $t&gt;0$, we derive quantitative error estimates between the solutions of (NSC) and (NSF). To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first strong convergence result for this relaxation procedure in the three-dimensional setting and for ill-prepared data.
  The (NSC) system is partially dissipative and incorporates both partial diffusion and partial damping mechanisms. To address these aspects and ensure the large-time stability of the solutions, we construct localized-in-frequency perturbed energy functionals based on the hypocoercivity theory. More precisely, our analysis relies on partitioning the frequency space into \textit{three} distinct regimes: low, medium and high frequencies. Within each frequency regime, we introduce effective unknowns and Lyapunov functionals, revealing the spectrally expected dissipative structures.</description>

      <title>Illposedness of incompressible fluids in supercritical Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are strongly illposed in supercritical Sobolev spaces. In the inviscid case, for any $0&lt;s&lt; \frac{5}{2} $, we construct a $C^\infty_c$ initial velocity field with arbitrarily small $H^{s} $ norm for which the unique local-in-time smooth solution of the 3D Euler equation develops large $\dot{H}^{s}$ norm inflation almost instantaneously. In the viscous case, the same $\dot{H}^{s}$ norm inflation occurs in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for $0&lt;s&lt; \frac{1}{2} $, where $s = \frac{1}{2}$ is scaling critical for this equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the rarefaction and compression characters for the supersonic expanding wave of the compressible Euler equations with radial symmetry. Under this new definition, we show that solutions with rarefaction initial data will not form shock in finite time, i.e. exist global-in-time as classical solutions. On the other hand, singularity forms in finite time when the initial data include strong compression somewhere. Several useful invariant domains will be also given.</description>

      <title>The search for NLS ground states on a hybrid domain: Motivations, methods, and results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of establishing the existence of the Ground States for the subcritical focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy on a domain made of a line and a plane intersecting at a point. The problem is physically motivated by the experimental realization of hybrid traps for Bose-Einstein Condensates, that are able to concentrate the system on structures close to the domain we consider. In fact, such a domain approximates the trap as the temperature approaches the absolute zero. The spirit of the paper is mainly pedagogical, so we focus on the formulation of the problem and on the explanation of the result, giving references for the technical points and for the proofs.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Random Evolution Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretisation error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretisation in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter-Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.01662v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture in fluid dynamics concerning optimal bounds for heat transportation in the infinite Prandtl number limit. Due to a maximum principle property for the temperature exploited by Constantin-Doering and Otto-Seis, this amounts to proving a-priori bounds for horizontally-periodic solutions of a fourth-order equation in a strip of large width. Such bounds are obtained here using Fourier analysis, integral representations, and a bilinear estimate due to Coifman and Meyer which uses the Carleson measure characterization of BMO functions by Fefferman.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the period and positive periodic solutions of a quasilinear equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the monotonicity of the minimal period of the periodic solutions of some quasilinear differential equations involving the $p$-Laplace operator. The monotonicity is obtained as a function of a Hamiltonian energy in two cases. We first extend to the case $p\ge2$ classical results for $p=2$ due to Chow and Wang, and Chicone. Then we consider a differential equation associated with a fundamental interpolation inequality in Sobolev spaces. In that case, we generalize to $p\ge2$ a recent result due to Benguria, Depassier and~Loss when $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems and Harnack inequalities for Allen-Cahn type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first give a logarithmic gradient estimate for positive solutions of Allen-Cahn equation on Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below. As its natural corallary, Harnack inequality and a Liouville theorem for classical positive solutions are obtained. Later, we consider similar estimate under integral curvature condition and generalize previous results to a class nonlinear equations which contain some classical elliptic equations such as Lane-Emden equation, static Whitehead-Newell equation and static Fisher-KPP equation. Last, we briefly generalize them to equation with gradient item under Bakry-\'{E}mery curvature condition.</description>

      <title>Local near-field scattering data enables unique reconstruction of rough electric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is the study of the inverse point-source scattering problem, specifically in relation to a certain class of electric potentials. Our research provides a novel uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data, obtained from the near field pattern. Our work improves the work of Caro and Garcia, who investigated both the direct problem and the inverse problem with global near field data for critically singular and $\delta$-shell potentials. The primary contribution of our research is the introduction of a Runge approximation result for the near field data on the scattering problem which, in combination with an interior regularity argument, enables us to establish a uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data. Additionaly, we manage to consider a slightly wider class of potentials.</description>

      <title>Large data existence of global-in-time strong solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in high space dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of strong solutions to the initial value problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^N, N\geq 3$. Our investigation shows that local in-time classical solutions do not develop singularity as long as the initial velocity lies in $(L^2(\mathbb{R}^N))^N\cap (L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N))^N$.</description>

      <title>On the Korteweg-de Vries limit for the Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is known as a universal equation describing various long waves in dispersive systems. In this article, we prove that in a certain scaling regime, a large class of rough solutions to the Boussinesq equation are approximated by the sums of two counter-propagating waves solving the KdV equations. It extends the earlier result by \cite{Schneider1998} to slightly more regular than $L^2$-solutions. Our proof is based on robust Fourier analysis methods developed for the low regularity theory of nonlinear dispersive equations.</description>

      <title>The sticky particle dynamics of the 1D pressureless Euler-alignment system as a gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the sticky dynamics for the one-dimensional pressureless Euler-alignment system can be obtained as an $L^2$-gradient flow of a convex functional. This is analogous to the Lagrangian evolution introduced by Natile and Savar\'{e} for the pressureless Euler system, and by Brenier et al. for the corresponding system with a self-interacting force field. Our Lagrangian evolution can be seen as the limit of sticky particle Cucker-Smale dynamics, similar to the solutions obtained by Leslie and Tan from a corresponding scalar balance law, and provides us with a uniquely determined distributional solution of the original system in the space of probability measures with quadratic moments and corresponding square-integrable velocities. Moreover, we show that the gradient flow also provides an entropy solution to the balance law of Leslie and Tan, and how their results on cluster formation follow naturally from (non-)convexity properties of the so-called natural velocity of the flow.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Markov processes of direction-dependent type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp pointwise heat kernel estimates for symmetric Markov processes associated with symmetric Dirichlet forms that are local with respect to some coordinates and nonlocal with respect to the remaining coordinates. The main theorem is a robustness result like the famous estimate for the fundamental solution of second order differential operators, obtained by Donald G. Aronson. Analogous to his result, we show that the corresponding translation-invariant process and the one given by the general Dirichlet form share the same pointwise points.</description>
