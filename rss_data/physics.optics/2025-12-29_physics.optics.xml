      <title>Broadband tunable microwave photonic radar for simultaneous detection of human respiration, heartbeat, and speech with deep learning-based speech recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal vital sign monitoring and speech detection hold significant importance in medical health, public safety, and other fields. This study proposes a broadband tunable microwave photonic radar system that can simultaneously monitor respiration, heartbeat, and speech. The system works by generating broadband radar signals to detect subtle skin displacements caused by these physiological activities. It then utilizes phase variations in radar echo signals to extract and reconstruct the corresponding physiological signals. In order to enhance the processing capability for speech signals, a convolutional neural network with a dual-channel feature fusion model is incorporated, enabling high-precision speech recognition. In addition, the system's frequency-tunable characteristic allows it to flexibly switch frequency bands to adapt to different working environments, greatly improving its practicality and environmental adaptability. In concept-verification experiments, speech signals were reconstructed and recognized in the Ku, K, and Ka bands, achieving recognition accuracies of 97.20%, 98.07%, and 97.43%, respectively. The system's capability to detect multimodal vital signs was also thoroughly validated using a respiratory and heartbeat simulator. During a 20-second monitoring period, while accurately reconstructing speech, the maximum average error counts for respiratory and heartbeat monitoring were 0.39 and 0.87, respectively, proving its reliability and effectiveness in multimodal vital sign monitoring.</description>

      <title>Incorporating rank-free coupling and external field via an amplitude-only modulated spatial photonic Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as effective solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, such as NP-hard problems, machine learning, and financial modeling. Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Band Touching and Nontrivial Winding Reveal Generalized Angular Momentum Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular momentum conservation stands as one of the most fundamental and robust laws of physics. In discrete lattices, however, its realization can deviate markedly from the continuous case, especially in the presence of nontrivial momentum-space band touchings. Here, we investigate angular momentum conservation associated with quadratic band-touching points (QBTPs) in two-dimensional lattices. We show that, unlike in graphene lattices hosting linear band-touching points (LBTPs), the conventional angular momentum is no longer conserved near QBTPs. Instead, we identify a generalized total angular momentum (GTAM) that remains conserved for both LBTPs and QBTPs, inherently determined by the topological winding number at the band-touching point (BTP). Using a photonic Kagome lattice, we experimentally demonstrate GTAM conservation through pseudospin-orbital angular momentum conversion. Furthermore, we show that this conservation principle extends to a broad class of discrete lattices with arbitrary pseudospin textures and higher-order winding numbers. These results reveal a fundamental link between pseudospin, angular momentum, and topology, establishing a unified framework for angular-momentum dynamics in discrete systems.</description>

      <title>On-chip quadratically nonlinear photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Involving deterministically nonlinear photoresponse in on-chip photodetector is intriguing to develop sophisticated functions in photonic integrated circuits, such as in-sensor computing and optoelectronic mixing, though the corresponding devices are still lack of sufficient investigation. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip quadratically nonlinear photodetector (QNPD) by configuring an InSe p-i-n homojunction on a silicon waveguide. Telecom-band light guiding in the waveguide couples with the InSe evanescently and is frequency up-converted into visible light via InSe's second-harmonic generation (SHG), which is subsequently absorbed by InSe and finally generates photocurrent under the built-in electric field of the p-i-n homojunction. Governed by these sequential processes, the on-chip QNPD presents a quadratic function between photocurrent and optical power. Thanks to the efficient SHG and well-established homojunction in InSe, the QNPD reaches a high normalized responsivity of 37.1 A/W2 and low dark current of 1 pA, representing greatly improved performances among reported nonlinear photodetectors. Benefiting from the extra SHG process, the on-chip QNPD intrinsically incorporates light-light interactions, enabling straightforwardly monitoring all-optically mixing signals electrically. As an example, an array of 16-pixel QNPDs was designed to implement a fully single-shot on-chip autocorrelator without requirement of bulky optics and external cameras, which precisely measures picosecond pulses with high sensitivity of 6.1*10-10 W2.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Circuits with Embedded Feedback for Parallel Multi-Wavelength Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear transformations are cornerstone operations utilized in modern computing, but are computationally expensive on current electronic platforms. Optical computing has been positioned as a new computing solution, promising high speed and energy efficiency by exploiting the available degrees of freedom of light. Although solutions exist in the optical domain, there is a continuous search for compact solutions that properly utilize the limited chip space and exploit various degrees of freedom of light. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact, programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture that operates on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom by leveraging embedded optical feedback loops. This architecture enables universal linear unitary transforms by combining resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers. The strong dispersion achieved from the resonant loops enables multi-frequency operation and reduces the number of required active layers to achieve universality. This solution reduces the optical port requirements, minimizes power losses, and leverages resonances to enable massive parallel computing in the frequency domain. The fabricated samples are compatible with silicon-on-insulator platforms and operate at single- and dual-frequency modes. The experimental setup demonstrates the ability to perform in situ training in both cases, validating the parallel-computing capabilities of the PICs. This work highlights the potential of feedback-loop PICs for scalable, compact, and energy-efficient linear optical computing.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Reflectionless Optical Routing via Non-Hermitian Zero-Index Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical routers are fundamental to photonic systems, but their performance is often limited by unwanted reflections and constrained functionalities. Existing design strategies generally lack complete control over reflectionless pathways and typically require computationally intensive iterative optimization. A general analytical framework for the inverse design of arbitrary reflectionless routing has remained unavailable. Here, we present an analytical inverse-design approach based on non-Hermitian zero-index networks, which enables arbitrary reflectionless routing for nearly any desired scattering response. By establishing a direct algebraic mapping between target scattering responses and the network's physical parameters, we transform the design process from iterative optimization into deterministic calculation. This approach enables the precise engineering of arbitrary reflectionless optical routing. We demonstrate its broad utility by designing devices from unicast and multicast routers with full amplitude and phase control to coherent beam combiners and spatial mode demultiplexers in four-port and six-port networks. Our work provides a systematic and analytical route to designing advanced light-control devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a rigorous, physically interpretable, and quantifiable definition of the photonic nanojet (PNJ). This framework resolves longstanding ambiguities in measuring PNJ dimensions and leverages an optimal mass transport-based metric to quantify PNJ quality. Building on this metric, we develop a PNJ steering methodology that requires no opto-mechanical intervention, relying solely on phase-only illumination modulation.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezers assisted coupling of nematic droplets to gold nanoparticle cluster: effect on whispering gallery modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dye doped liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets exhibit tunable optical resonances modulated by size, shape, temperature, and external perturbations. When a dye-doped nematic microdroplet is coupled to a gold nanoparticle cluster, near-field interactions enhance local electric fields, boosting fluorescence emission. Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye doped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic coupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). This configuration resulted in amplified WGMs, with a clearly detectable shift in the spectral position. Resonance mode red shifts confirmed efficient photonic plasmonic coupling, with up to seven nm tunability achieved without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of the gold nanoparticle cluster. Also, the WGM emission spectrum of the nematic microdroplet can be reversibly tuned by decoupling from the gold nanoparticle cluster.</description>

Abstract: The spectral and statistical properties are explored for surface plasmon (SP) emission in resonance fluorescence from a driven two level emitter in the proximity of 2D single graphene sheet. We derive an exact closed form analytic expression for the emitted SP field valid in the near and far regions. The SP field profile and spectrum function depend on the graphene conductivity and take into account the dynamic control parameters, namely Fermi energy. We present analysis for the spectrum and second order coherence functions and discuss the possibility of their control using graphene system parameters to manipulate the spectral linewidth and second order coherence function.</description>

Abstract: The optical and plasmonic properties of metal-dielectric nanoeggs were investigated in this study. Frequency dependencies of polarizability, absorption and scattering cross-sections, and radiation efficiency were determined. Expressions describing the size-dependent behavior of surface plasmon resonance frequencies were derived. The causes of blue and red shifts in the maxima of polarizability, absorption, and scattering cross-sections as well as variations in their number and amplitude were identified. Recommendations were proposed regarding the use of materials with maximum radiation efficiency in different spectral ranges.</description>

      <title>Microscale selective laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles with a short-wavelength nanosecond laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Power-Scalable Generation of High-Order Optical Vortices Via Coherent Beam Combining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structured light beams, such as optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum, are essential for applications ranging from low-power optical communications to high-intensity laser-matter interactions. However, scaling their power and energy while preserving complex phase and spatial structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we demonstrate coherent beam combining as a versatile and scalable method for generating high-power structured beams without limitations on topological charge or spatial structure, while maintaining exceptionally high modal purity. We experimentally implement coherent beam combining for optical vortex beams with topological charges l = 1, 5, and 8, achieving a combined average power of 100 W and a peak power of 100 kW, with combining efficiencies of 95.0%, 93.9%, and 91.2%, respectively. Off-axis digital holography confirms that the phase and intensity profiles of the combined beams retain high modal purity, even at high topological charges. These results establish coherent beam combining as an effective route to high modal purity structured light at high power levels, unlocking new opportunities for advanced photonics and high-intensity light-matter interaction studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Robust Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion via Detuning Modulated Composite Segments Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) holds a pivotal role in quantum physics, facilitating the creation of entangled photon pairs, heralded single photons and squeezed light, critical resources for many applications in quantum technologies. However, their production is susceptible to physical variations, posing limitations on their robust utility. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a method to significantly enhance the reliability of entangled photon pair generation. This approach involves introducing a composite design scheme to the SPDC process. The design is based on the development of a theoretical composite segments framework for SU(1,1), offering increased error resilience and robustness of the process. The practical application is experimentally demonstrated by modulating the nonlinear coefficient of a KTP crystal for degenerate 532 nm to 1064 nm conversion, resulting in an effective sevenfold improvement in stability of photon-pair generation and coincidence rate against temperature fluctuations compared to conventional quasi-phase-matching techniques. Furthermore, the presented concept is applicable to other physical systems that exhibit SU(1,1) dynamics. This methodology can create a leap forward in quantum technologies by significantly enhancing stability and error tolerance, thus paving the way for a new generation of entangled photon sources, holding promise for quantum information processing, communication, and precision measurement applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Coherence Elastography Measures Mechanical Tension in the Lens and Capsule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lens tension is essential for accommodative vision but remains difficult to measure with precision. Here, we present an optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique that quantifies both tension and elastic modulus in the lens capsule and underlying tissue. This method derives mechanical parameters from surface wave dispersion across a critical frequency range of 1-30 kHz. Using isolated lenses from six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of 0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by intra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. The mean shear moduli of anterior and posterior capsules were 630 kPa and 400 kPa, respectively, nearly 100-fold greater than that of the cortical tissues, where tensions were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4% strain) increased anterior capsular tension by 67 kPa, with a low uncertainty of only 2 kPa. This optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing accommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect with Exact Steady States in the Dissipative Quantum Link Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Despite the complexity arising from many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetry enables the exact construction of a steady state that displays the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>Giant exciton binding energy in bulk CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials, with their unique combination of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties, are emerging as promising platforms for exploring excitonic phenomena. Thus far, the choice of materials with exceptional excitonic response has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) configurations of vdW materials. At the same time, large interlayer distance and the possibility to create a variety of heterostructures offers an opportunity to control the dielectric screening in van der Waals heterostructures and van der Waals 3D materials, thus engineering the excitonic properties. Here, we reveal that bulk vdW crystal CrCl3 answers this quest with a record exciton binding energy of 1.64 eV owing to a delicate interplay of quasi-2D electronic confinement and local magnetic correlations. We also suggest that the non-local magnetic correlations play an important role in the temperature dependence of photoluminescence intensity. Furthermore, we observe colossal binding energies in vdW crystals NbOCl2 (0.66 eV) and MoCl3 (0.35 eV) and formulate a universal exciton binding energy dependence on bandgap for 2D and 3D vdW materials. Hence, our findings establish a fundamental link between the layered structure of vdW materials and their excitonic properties.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Nano-scale Crystal Deformation using Coherent X-ray Dynamical Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based reconstruction method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric-based optical selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Link Budget Analysis for Low Earth Orbit Satellites in the Optical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.</description>

      <title>Frequency Domain Berry Curvature Effect on Time Refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there exist frequency domain Berry curvature in the wave function of photons in dispersive optical systems. This property arises from the frequency dispersion of its dielectric function, which makes Maxwell equations a non-standard eigenvalue equation, with the eigenvalue (frequency) appearing inside the operator itself. We study this new Berry curvature effect on time refraction of magnetoplasmon-polariton as an example. It can induce deflection in the trajectory of a photon and make the ray swing.</description>
