      <title>Beyond Correlation: Evaluating Multimedia Quality Models with the Constrained Concordance Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the evaluation of multimedia quality models, focusing on the inherent uncertainties in subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings due to factors like rater inconsistency and bias. Traditional statistical measures such as Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC), and Kendall's Tau (KTAU) often fail to account for these uncertainties, leading to inaccuracies in model performance assessment. We introduce the Constrained Concordance Index (CCI), a novel metric designed to overcome the limitations of existing metrics by considering the statistical significance of MOS differences and excluding comparisons where MOS confidence intervals overlap. Through comprehensive experiments across various domains including speech and image quality assessment, we demonstrate that CCI provides a more robust and accurate evaluation of instrumental quality models, especially in scenarios of low sample sizes, rater group variability, and restriction of range. Our findings suggest that incorporating rater subjectivity and focusing on statistically significant pairs can significantly enhance the evaluation framework for multimedia quality prediction models. This work not only sheds light on the overlooked aspects of subjective rating uncertainties but also proposes a methodological advancement for more reliable and accurate quality model evaluation.</description>

      <title>Harmful YouTube Video Detection: A Taxonomy of Online Harm and MLLMs as Alternative Annotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short video platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok, are used by billions of users globally. These platforms expose users to harmful content, ranging from clickbait or physical harms to misinformation or online hate. Yet, detecting harmful videos remains challenging due to an inconsistent understanding of what constitutes harm and limited resources and mental tolls involved in human annotation. As such, this study advances measures and methods to detect harm in video content. First, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy for online harm on video platforms, categorizing it into six categories: Information, Hate and harassment, Addictive, Clickbait, Sexual, and Physical harms. Next, we establish multimodal large language models as reliable annotators of harmful videos. We analyze 19,422 YouTube videos using 14 image frames, 1 thumbnail, and text metadata, comparing the accuracy of crowdworkers (Mturk) and GPT-4-Turbo with domain expert annotations serving as the gold standard. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4-Turbo outperforms crowdworkers in both binary classification (harmful vs. harmless) and multi-label harm categorization tasks. Methodologically, this study extends the application of LLMs to multi-label and multi-modal contexts beyond text annotation and binary classification. Practically, our study contributes to online harm mitigation by guiding the definitions and identification of harmful content on video platforms.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Learning-based Lossless Event-based Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are a cutting-edge type of visual sensors that capture data by detecting brightness changes at the pixel level asynchronously. These cameras offer numerous benefits over conventional cameras, including high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, low latency, and lower power consumption. However, the substantial data rates they produce require efficient compression techniques, while also fulfilling other typical application requirements, such as the ability to respond to visual changes in real-time or near real-time. Additionally, many event-based applications demand high accuracy, making lossless coding desirable, as it retains the full detail of the sensor data. Learning-based methods show great potential due to their ability to model the unique characteristics of event data thus allowing to achieve high compression rates. This paper proposes a low-complexity lossless coding solution based on the quadtree representation that outperforms traditional compression algorithms in efficiency and speed, ensuring low computational complexity and minimal delay for real-time applications. Experimental results show that the proposed method delivers better compression ratios, i.e., with fewer bits per event, and lower computational complexity compared to current lossless data compression methods.</description>

      <title>Diversify, Contextualize, and Adapt: Efficient Entropy Modeling for Neural Image Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a fast and effective entropy model is challenging but essential for practical application of neural codecs. Beyond spatial autoregressive entropy models, more efficient backward adaptation-based entropy models have been recently developed. They not only reduce decoding time by using smaller number of modeling steps but also maintain or even improve rate--distortion performance by leveraging more diverse contexts for backward adaptation. Despite their significant progress, we argue that their performance has been limited by the simple adoption of the design convention for forward adaptation: using only a single type of hyper latent representation, which does not provide sufficient contextual information, especially in the first modeling step. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective entropy modeling framework that leverages sufficient contexts for forward adaptation without compromising on bit-rate. Specifically, we introduce a strategy of diversifying hyper latent representations for forward adaptation, i.e., using two additional types of contexts along with the existing single type of context. In addition, we present a method to effectively use the diverse contexts for contextualizing the current elements to be encoded/decoded. By addressing the limitation of the previous approach, our proposed framework leads to significant performance improvements. Experimental results on popular datasets show that our proposed framework consistently improves rate--distortion performance across various bit-rate regions, e.g., 3.73% BD-rate gain over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Kodak dataset.</description>

      <title>Loss-tolerant neural video codec aware congestion control for real time video communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of reinforcement learning's (RL) ability to automatically create more adaptive controlling logics beyond the hand-crafted heuristics, numerous effort has been made to apply RL to congestion control (CC) design for real time video communication (RTC) applications and has successfully shown promising benefits over the rule-based RTC CCs. Online reinforcement learning is often adopted to train the RL models so the models can directly adapt to real network environments. However, its trail-and-error manner can also cause catastrophic degradation of the quality of experience (QoE) of RTC application at run time. Thus, safeguard strategies such as falling back to hand-crafted heuristics can be used to run along with RL models to guarantee the actions explored in the training sensible, despite that these safeguard strategies interrupt the learning process and make it more challenging to discover optimal RL policies.
  The recent emergence of loss-tolerant neural video codecs (NVC) naturally provides a layer of protection for the online learning of RL-based congestion control because of its resilience to packet losses, but such packet loss resilience have not been fully exploited in prior works yet. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based congestion control which can be aware of and takes advantage of packet loss tolerance characteristic of NVCs via reward in online RL learning. Through extensive evaluation on various videos and network traces in a simulated environment, we demonstrate that our NVC-aware CC running with the loss-tolerant NVC reduces the training time by 41\% compared to other prior RL-based CCs. It also boosts the mean video quality by 0.3 to 1.6dB, lower the tail frame delay by 3 to 200ms, and reduces the video stalls by 20\% to 77\% in comparison with other baseline RTC CCs.</description>

      <title>JPEG AI Image Compression Visual Artifacts: Detection Methods and Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based image compression methods have improved in recent years and started to outperform traditional codecs. However, neural-network approaches can unexpectedly introduce visual artifacts in some images. We therefore propose methods to separately detect three types of artifacts (texture and boundary degradation, color change, and text corruption), to localize the affected regions, and to quantify the artifact strength. We consider only those regions that exhibit distortion due solely to the neural compression but that a traditional codec recovers successfully at a comparable bitrate. We employed our methods to collect artifacts for the JPEG AI verification model with respect to HM-18.0, the H.265 reference software. We processed about 350,000 unique images from the Open Images dataset using different compression-quality parameters; the result is a dataset of 46,440 artifacts validated through crowd-sourced subjective assessment. Our proposed dataset and methods are valuable for testing neural-network-based image codecs, identifying bugs in these codecs, and enhancing their performance. We make source code of the methods and the dataset publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Compression Technique for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates excellent rendering quality and generation speed in novel view synthesis. However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.</description>

      <title>Video Summarization: Towards Entity-Aware Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing popular video captioning benchmarks and models deal with generic captions devoid of specific person, place or organization named entities. In contrast, news videos present a challenging setting where the caption requires such named entities for meaningful summarization. As such, we propose the task of summarizing news video directly to entity-aware captions. We also release a large-scale dataset, VIEWS (VIdeo NEWS), to support research on this task. Further, we propose a method that augments visual information from videos with context retrieved from external world knowledge to generate entity-aware captions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three video captioning models. We also show that our approach generalizes to existing news image captions dataset. With all the extensive experiments and insights, we believe we establish a solid basis for future research on this challenging task.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Illusions: Understanding Human Perception of Audiovisual Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of contemporary deepfakes has attracted significant attention in machine learning research, as artificial intelligence (AI) generated synthetic media increases the incidence of misinterpretation and is difficult to distinguish from genuine content. Currently, machine learning techniques have been extensively studied for automatically detecting deepfakes. However, human perception has been less explored. Malicious deepfakes could ultimately cause public and social problems. Can we humans correctly perceive the authenticity of the content of the videos we watch? The answer is obviously uncertain; therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the human ability to discern deepfake videos through a subjective study. We present our findings by comparing human observers to five state-ofthe-art audiovisual deepfake detection models. To this end, we used gamification concepts to provide 110 participants (55 native English speakers and 55 non-native English speakers) with a webbased platform where they could access a series of 40 videos (20 real and 20 fake) to determine their authenticity. Each participant performed the experiment twice with the same 40 videos in different random orders. The videos are manually selected from the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We found that all AI models performed better than humans when evaluated on the same 40 videos. The study also reveals that while deception is not impossible, humans tend to overestimate their detection capabilities. Our experimental results may help benchmark human versus machine performance, advance forensics analysis, and enable adaptive countermeasures.</description>
