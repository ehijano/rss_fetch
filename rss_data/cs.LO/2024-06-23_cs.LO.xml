      <title>Model Checking Markov Chains as Distribution Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional perspective on Markov chains considers decision problems concerning the probabilities of temporal properties being satisfied by traces of visited states. However, consider the following query made of a stochastic system modelling the weather: given the conditions today, will there be a day with less than 50\% chance of rain? The conventional perspective is ill-equipped to decide such problems regarding the evolution of the initial distribution. The alternate perspective we consider views Markov chains as distribution transformers: the focus is on the sequence of distributions on states at each step, where the evolution is driven by the underlying stochastic transition matrix. More precisely, given an initial distribution vector $\mu$, a stochastic update transition matrix $M$, we ask whether the ensuing sequence of distributions $(\mu, M\mu, M^2\mu, \dots)$ satisfies a given temporal property. This is a special case of the model-checking problem for linear dynamical systems, which is not known to be decidable in full generality. The goal of this article is to delineate the classes of instances for which this problem can be solved, under the assumption that the dynamics is governed by stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Phase-Bounded Broadcast Networks over Topologies of Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study networks of processes that all execute the same finite state protocol and that communicate through broadcasts. The processes are organized in a graph (a topology) and only the neighbors of a process in this graph can receive its broadcasts. The coverability problem asks, given a protocol and a state of the protocol, whether there is a topology for the processes such that one of them (at least) reaches the given state. This problem is undecidable. We study here an under-approximation of the problem where processes alternate a bounded number of times $k$ between phases of broadcasting and phases of receiving messages. We show that, if the problem remains undecidable when $k$ is greater than 6, it becomes decidable for $k=2$, and EXPSPACE-complete for $k=1$. Furthermore, we show that if we restrict ourselves to line topologies, the problem is in $P$ for $k=1$ and $k=2$.</description>

      <title>Grants4Companies: Applying Declarative Methods for Recommending and Reasoning About Business Grants in the Austrian Public Administration (System Description)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the methods and technologies underlying the application Grants4Companies. The application uses a logic-based expert system to display a list of business grants suitable for the logged-in business. To evaluate suitability of the grants, formal representations of their conditions are evaluated against properties of the business, taken from the registers of the Austrian public administration. The logical language for the representations of the grant conditions is based on S-expressions. We further describe a Proof of Concept implementation of reasoning over the formalised grant conditions. The proof of concept is implemented in Common Lisp and interfaces with a reasoning engine implemented in Scryer Prolog. The application has recently gone live and is provided as part of the Business Service Portal by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance.</description>

      <title>Pathformer: Recursive Path Query Encoding for Complex Logical Query Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Logical Query Answering (CLQA) over incomplete knowledge graphs is a challenging task. Recently, Query Embedding (QE) methods are proposed to solve CLQA by performing multi-hop logical reasoning. However, most of them only consider historical query context information while ignoring future information, which leads to their failure to capture the complex dependencies behind the elements of a query. In recent years, the transformer architecture has shown a strong ability to model long-range dependencies between words. The bidirectional attention mechanism proposed by the transformer can solve the limitation of these QE methods regarding query context. Still, as a sequence model, it is difficult for the transformer to model complex logical queries with branch structure computation graphs directly. To this end, we propose a neural one-point embedding method called Pathformer based on the tree-like computation graph, i.e., query computation tree. Specifically, Pathformer decomposes the query computation tree into path query sequences by branches and then uses the transformer encoder to recursively encode these path query sequences to obtain the final query embedding. This allows Pathformer to fully utilize future context information to explicitly model the complex interactions between various parts of the path query. Experimental results show that Pathformer outperforms existing competitive neural QE methods, and we found that Pathformer has the potential to be applied to non-one-point embedding space.</description>

      <title>An independence of the MIN principle from the PHP principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimization principle MIN($\prec$) studied in bounded arithmetic in [Chiari, M. and Kraj\'i\v{c}ek, J. Witnessing Functions in Bounded Arithmetic and Search Problems, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 63(3):1095-1115, 1998] says that a strict linear ordering $\prec$ on any finite interval $[0,\dots,n)$ has the minimal element. We shall prove that bounded arithmetic theory $T^1_2(\prec)$ augmented by instances of the pigeonhole principle for all $\Delta^b_1(\prec)$ formulas does not prove MIN($\prec$).</description>

      <title>On Quantifiers for Quantitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a kind of first-order predicate logic with intended semantics in the reals. Compared to other approaches in the literature, we work predominantly in the multiplicative reals $[0,\infty]$, showing they support three generations of connectives, that we call non-linear, linear additive, and linear multiplicative. Means and harmonic means emerge as natural candidates for bounded existential and universal quantifiers, and in fact we see they behave as expected in relation to the other logical connectives. We explain this fact through the well-known fact that min/max and arithmetic mean/harmonic mean sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, that of p-means. We give syntax and semantics for this quantitative predicate logic, and as example applications, we show how softmax is the quantitative semantics of argmax, and R\'enyi entropy/Hill numbers are additive/multiplicative semantics of the same formula. Indeed, the additive reals also fit into the story by exploiting the Napierian duality $-\log \dashv 1/\exp$, which highlights a formal distinction between 'additive' and 'multiplicative' quantities. Finally, we describe two attempts at a categorical semantics via enriched hyperdoctrines. We discuss why hyperdoctrines are in fact probably inadequate for this kind of logic.</description>

      <title>Provable Guarantees for Model Performance via Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose using mechanistic interpretability -- techniques for reverse engineering model weights into human-interpretable algorithms -- to derive and compactly prove formal guarantees on model performance. We prototype this approach by formally proving lower bounds on the accuracy of 151 small transformers trained on a Max-of-$K$ task. We create 102 different computer-assisted proof strategies and assess their length and tightness of bound on each of our models. Using quantitative metrics, we find that shorter proofs seem to require and provide more mechanistic understanding. Moreover, we find that more faithful mechanistic understanding leads to tighter performance bounds. We confirm these connections by qualitatively examining a subset of our proofs. Finally, we identify compounding structureless noise as a key challenge for using mechanistic interpretability to generate compact proofs on model performance.</description>
