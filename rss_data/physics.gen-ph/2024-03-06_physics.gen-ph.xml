      <title>On the Relations between Fermion Masses and Isospin Couplings in the Microscopic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark and lepton masses and mixings are considered in the framework of the microscopic model. The most general ansatz for the interactions among tetrons leads to a Hamiltonian $H_T$ involving Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Heisenberg and torsional isospin forces. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian provides for 24 eigenvalues which are identified as the quark and lepton masses. While the masses of the third and second family arise from DM and Heisenberg type of isospin interactions, light family masses are related to torsional interactions among tetrons. Neutrino masses turn out to be special in that they are given in terms of tiny isospin non-conserving DM, Heisenberg and torsional couplings. The approach not only leads to masses, but also allows to calculate the quark and lepton eigenstates, an issue, which is important for the determination of the CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. Compact expressions for the eigenfunctions of $H_T$ are given. The almost exact isospin conservation of the system dictates the form of the lepton states and makes them independent of all the couplings in $H_T$. Much in contrast, there is a strong dependence of the quark states on the coupling strengths, and a promising hierarchy between the quark families shows up.</description>

      <title>All About the Galilean Group SGal(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07555v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Galilean group of transformations that preserve spatial distances and absolute time intervals between events in spacetime. The special Galilean group SGal(3) is a 10-dimensional Lie group; we examine the structure of the group and its Lie algebra and discuss the representation of uncertainty on the group manifold. Along the way, we mention several other groups, including the special orthogonal group, the special Euclidean group, and the group of extended poses, all of which are subgroups of the Galilean group. We describe the role of time in Galilean relativity and touch on the relationship between temporal and spatial uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Clifford algebra Cl(0,6) approach to beyond the standard model and naturalness problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there more to Dirac's gamma matrices than meets the eye? It turns out that gamma zero can be factorized into a product of three operators. This revelation facilitates the expansion of Dirac's space-time algebra to Clifford algebra Cl(0,6). The resultant rich geometric structure can be leveraged to establish a combined framework of the standard model and gravity, wherein a gravi-weak interaction between the extended vierbein field and the extended weak gauge field is allowed. Inspired by the composite Higgs model, we examine the vierbein field as an effective description of the fermion-antifermion condensation. The compositeness of space-time manifests itself at an energy scale which is different from the Planck scale. We propose that all the regular classical Lagrangian terms are of quantum condensation origin, thus possibly addressing the cosmological constant problem provided that we adopt an unconventional multi-scale renormalization procedure for quantum condensations that entail multiplications of divergent integrals. The Clifford algebra approach also permits a weaker form of charge conjugation without particle-antiparticle interchange, which leads to a Majorana-type mass that conserves lepton number. Additionally, in the context of spontaneous breaking of two global U(1) symmetries, we explore a three-Higgs-doublet model with Higgs VEVs 246 GeV, 41 GeV and 2.5 GeV which could explain the fermion mass hierarchies.</description>
