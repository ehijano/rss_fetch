      <title>Repositioning, Ride-matching, and Abandonment in On-demand Ride-hailing Platforms: A Mean Field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-demand ride-hailing industry has experienced rapid growth, transforming transportation norms worldwide. Despite improvements in efficiency over traditional taxi services, significant challenges remain, including drivers' strategic repositioning behavior, customer abandonment, and inefficiencies in dispatch algorithms. To address these issues, we introduce a comprehensive mean field game model that systematically analyzes the dynamics of ride-hailing platforms by incorporating driver repositioning across multiple regions, customer abandonment behavior, and platform dispatch algorithms. Using this framework, we identify all possible mean field equilibria as the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of an associated optimization problem. Our analysis reveals the emergence of multiple equilibria, including the inefficient "Wild Goose Chase" one, characterized by drivers pursuing distant requests, leading to suboptimal system performance. To mitigate these inefficiencies, we propose a novel two-matching-radius nearest-neighbor dispatch algorithm that eliminates undesirable equilibria and ensures a unique mean field equilibrium for multi-region systems. The algorithm dynamically adjusts matching radii based on driver supply rates, optimizing pick-up times and waiting times for drivers while maximizing request completion rates. Numerical experiments and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces customer abandonment, minimizes waiting times for both customers and drivers, and improves overall platform efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient Near-Optimal Algorithm for Online Shortest Paths in Directed Acyclic Graphs with Bandit Feedback Against Adaptive Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the online shortest path problem in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) under bandit feedback against an adaptive adversary. Given a DAG $G = (V, E)$ with a source node $v_{\mathsf{s}}$ and a sink node $v_{\mathsf{t}}$, let $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^{|E|}$ denote the set of all paths from $v_{\mathsf{s}}$ to $v_{\mathsf{t}}$. At each round $t$, we select a path $\mathbf{x}_t \in X$ and receive bandit feedback on our loss $\langle \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}_t \rangle \in [-1,1]$, where $\mathbf{y}_t$ is an adversarially chosen loss vector. Our goal is to minimize regret with respect to the best path in hindsight over $T$ rounds. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm to achieve a near-minimax optimal regret bound of $\tilde O(\sqrt{|E|T\log |X|})$ with high probability against any adaptive adversary, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors in the number of edges $|E|$. Our algorithm leverages a novel loss estimator and a centroid-based decomposition in a nontrivial manner to attain this regret bound.
  As an application, we show that our algorithm for DAGs provides state-of-the-art efficient algorithms for $m$-sets, extensive-form games, the Colonel Blotto game, shortest walks in directed graphs, hypercubes, and multi-task multi-armed bandits, achieving improved high-probability regret guarantees in all these settings.</description>

      <title>Antithetic Sampling for Top-k Shapley Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive feature explanations rely primarily on game-theoretic notions such as the Shapley value by viewing features as cooperating players. The Shapley value's popularity in and outside of explainable AI stems from its axiomatic uniqueness. However, its computational complexity severely limits practicability. Most works investigate the uniform approximation of all features' Shapley values, needlessly consuming samples for insignificant features. In contrast, identifying the $k$ most important features can already be sufficiently insightful and yields the potential to leverage algorithmic opportunities connected to the field of multi-armed bandits. We propose Comparable Marginal Contributions Sampling (CMCS), a method for the top-$k$ identification problem utilizing a new sampling scheme taking advantage of correlated observations. We conduct experiments to showcase the efficacy of our method in compared to competitive baselines. Our empirical findings reveal that estimation quality for the approximate-all problem does not necessarily transfer to top-$k$ identification and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Controlled Social Learning: Altruism vs. Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of sequential social learning in which a planner may pay a cost to adjust the private signal precision of some agents. This framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that sheds light on practical policy questions, such as how the socially optimal level of ad personalization changes according to current beliefs or how a biased planner might derail social learning. We then characterize the optimal policies of an altruistic planner who maximizes social welfare and a biased planner who seeks to induce a specific action. Even for a planner who has equivalent knowledge to an individual, cannot lie or cherry-pick information, and is fully observable, we demonstrate that it can dramatically influence social welfare in both positive and negative directions. An important area for future exploration is how one might prevent these latter outcomes to protect against the manipulation of social learning.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Agents Have Regret? A Case Study in Online Learning and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of voting rules based on majority margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting rules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting rule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head margins of victory or loss between candidates, then the voting rule yields the same outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural invariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative axiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question for voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a ranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is margin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative content. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two voters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either voter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on the election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's preference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>
