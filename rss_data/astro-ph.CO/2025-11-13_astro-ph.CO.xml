      <title>Gravity-Selected Galaxy Clusters: a Tight Mass-Richness relation and an unclear Compton $Y$-richness trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, the third in a series, investigates the scaling relations between optical richness, weak-lensing mass, and Compton $Y$ for a sample of galaxy clusters selected purely by the effect of their gravitational potential on the shapes of background galaxies. This selection method is uncommon, as most cluster samples in the literature are selected based on signals originating from cluster baryons. We analize a complete sample of 13 gravity-selected clusters at intermediate redshifts (with $0.12 \leq z_{phot} \leq 0.40$) with weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 7. We measured cluster richness by counting red-sequence galaxies, identifying two cases of line-of-sight projections in the process, later confirmed by spectroscopic data. Both clusters are sufficiently separated in redshift that contamination in richness can be straighforwardly dealt because the two red sequences do not blend each other. We find an exceptionally tight richness--mass relation using our red-sequence-based richness estimator, with a scatter of just $\sim0.05$ dex, smaller than the intrinsic scatter of Compton Y with mass for the same sample. The lower scatter highlights the effectiveness of richness compared to Compton $Y$. No outliers are found in the richness-mass scaling, whether or not one cluster with a mass likely affected by projection effects is included in the sample. In the Compton $Y$-richness plane, the data do not delineate a clear trend. The limited sample size is not the sole reason for the unclear relation between Compton $Y$ and richness, since the same sample, with identical richness values, exhibits a highly significant and tight mass-richness correlation.</description>

      <title>How to evaluate the sufficiency and complementarity of summary statistics for cosmic fields: an information-theoretic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of increasingly advanced surveys and cosmic tracers has motivated the development of new inference techniques and novel approaches to extracting information from cosmic fields. A central challenge in this endeavor is to quantify the information content carried by these summary statistics in cosmic fields. In particular, how should we assess which statistics are more informative than others and assess the exact degree of complementarity of the information from each statistic? Here, we introduce mutual information (MI) that provides, from an information-theoretic perspective, a natural framework for assessing the sufficiency and complementarity of summary statistics in cosmological data. We demonstrate how MI can be applied to typical inference tasks to make information-theoretic evaluations, using two representative examples: the cosmic microwave background map, from which the power spectrum extracts almost all information as is expected for a Gaussian random field, and the 21~cm brightness temperature map, from which the scattering transform extracts the most non-Gaussian information but is complementary to power spectrum and bispectrum. Our results suggest that MI offers a robust theoretical foundation for evaluating and improving summaries, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of cosmic fields from an information-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Analytical Description of Baryonic Matter Fluctuations Using Jeans Filtering Functions in Second-Order Cosmological Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation theory provides the fundamental framework for describing the evolution of the matter-energy density field in an expanding Universe and serves as the basis for understanding the formation of large-scale structures within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We present an analytical approach to describe the evolution of fluctuations in a mixed fluid composed of cold dark matter (CDM) and baryonic matter. Assuming that the Universe is governed by General Relativity, we employ the Vlasov equation to derive the general equations of motion for this mixed cosmological fluid, incorporating baryonic effects through the stress tensor by considering only the contributions from baryonic pressure. We introduce the Jeans filtering functions as a biasing tool that allows us to describe baryonic fluctuations with CDM as a tracer, and we obtain an analytical description of the fluctuations -a novel and uncommon approach compared to the accepted computational advances currently available in this field. First- and second-order solutions are obtained through a single iteration of the equations of motion, with the aim of identifying how the filtering scale behaves in a second-order theory compared to the linear one, as well as some of its impacts on the matter power spectrum without the need to compute it explicitly. For the first time, these kind of solutions are derived entirely through an analytical method. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions for baryonic fluctuations in the density and velocity fields, which can be readily evaluated and provide valuable insights into the role of baryons in the Large-scale structure of the Universe. Consequently, these results reveal how pressure effects shift the filtering scale and how including this component could influence parameters such as the filtering mass and the temperature of the pressure-supported components.</description>

      <title>Search for host galaxies of unlocalized Fast Radio Bursts in the SDSS IV catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This theoretical work investigates different models to predict the redshift of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from their observed dispersion measure (DM) and other reported properties. We performed an extensive revision of the FRBs with confirmed galaxy hosts in the literature and compiled an updated catalog. With this sample of FRBs, composed of 117 unique transients, we explore four physically motivated models that relate the DM and redshift ($z$): a linear trend (inspired by the Macquart relation), a log-parabolic function, a power-law, and a combined model from the above. We assess the success of these theoretical proposals by implementing different statistical metrics and ranking them. The DM-$z$ relations are also tested using 100 realizations of 500 simulated FRBs, which follow the observed DM trends. Relying on our theoretical modeling, we establish the probability of $\sim$1000 FRBs with unknown $z$ (from the latest CHIME data release) to be hosted by galaxies in the SDSS archival dataset. Our validation scheme allows us to predict the FRBs with a probability threshold of $\geq$0.95 to originate in these galaxies, using their 2D angular position in the sky, magnitude in the r-band, and redshift. This statistical proposal will be tested with upcoming data releases from DESI and new generations of galaxy surveys, such as Euclid, and it opens brilliant possibilities to localize these transients in an automatic pipeline.</description>

      <title>Recombination Clumping Factor of Physically Defined Intergalactic Medium at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recombination clumping factor, $C$, is a key parameter in modeling cosmic reionization, but its value is sensitive to the definition of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We investigate the clumping factor using the GAMER adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulation code. We introduce a new, physically-motivated definition of the IGM based on the effective transmission factor of ionizing photons. We perform large-scale, full-box simulations with varying intensities of the uniform ultraviolet background, and we find that our physically-defined clumping factor is significantly lower than the values derived from traditional overdensity thresholds. We also introduce an analytic model that distinguishes between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted averages of the neutral fraction, and we find the difference in reionization timing of $\Delta z \sim 2$ depending on the assumed clumping factor and the relation between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted neutral fractions. Our zoom-in simulations further show that, while SN feedback increases the clumping factor locally, the effect is limited to $\sim 100$ kpc scales and does not significantly alter the global clumping factor. The substantially lower clumping factor reduces the required ionizing photon budget, potentially alleviating tension for reionization scenarios driven by rare, bright sources like active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Unbiased analysis of primordial non-Gaussianity: the multipoles of the full relativistic power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major goal of ongoing and future cosmological surveys of the large-scale structure is to measure local type primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy power spectrum through the scale-dependent bias. General relativistic effects have been shown to be degenerate with this measurement, therefore requiring a non-Newtonian approach. In this work, we develop a consistent framework to compute integrated effects, including lensing convergence, time delay, and integrated Sachs--Wolfe, along with the local relativistic projection and wide-separation corrections in the multipoles of the power spectrum. We show that, for a \textit{Euclid}-like H$\alpha$-line galaxy survey and a MegaMapper-like Lyman-break galaxy survey, ignoring these effects leads to a bias on the best fit measurement of the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, of around $ 3\,\sigma$ and $ 20 \, \sigma$ respectively. When we include these corrections, the uncertainty in our knowledge of the luminosity function leads to further uncertainty in our measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$. In this work, we show that this degeneracy can be partly mitigated by using a bright-faint multi-tracer analysis, where the observed galaxy sample is subdivided into two separate populations based on luminosity, which provides a $15$--$20\%$ improvement on the forecasted constraints of local type $f_{\rm NL}$. In addition, we present a novel calculation of the full multi-tracer covariance with the inclusion of wide-separation corrections~-- all of these results are implemented in the \textit{Python} code \textsc{CosmoWAP}.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension problem is one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. In this paper, we study the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy (HDE). To perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis, we select six representative theoretical models from all four categories of HDE. For the observational data, we adopt the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), a collection of alternative BAO data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from the $Planck$ 2018, the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 compilations. We find that HDE models that employ the Hubble scale or its combinations as the IR cutoff cannot alleviate the Hubble tension problem. In contrast, HDE models that employ the future event horizon as the IR cutoff can significantly alleviate the Hubble tension problem. It must be stressed that these two key conclusions hold true for cases of adopting different theoretical HDE models and different observational data. Our findings advocate for further exploration of HDE models using other types of cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>From M100 to NGC 7331: A Multiband Study and Physical Parameters in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study five nearby galaxies (M100/NGC 4321, NGC 1300, M 74, M 60, and NGC 7331) by combining multiband imaging (optical, UV, NIR, and X-rays) with simple photometric measurements to show how each spectral window traces different physical components: UV/blue emphasizes recent star formation, NIR outlines the old stellar mass and internal structure, and X-rays reveal compact sources and hot gas. For M100 we present a multiband mosaic with X-ray contours including the SN 1979C region. We compare isophotal morphology in NGC 1300 (barred) and M 74 (unbarred), quantify ellipticity and equivalent radius in M 60, and illustrate a Tully-Fisher distance estimate for NGC 7331, discussing assumptions (inclination, internal corrections) and consistency with classical scales. Our results underscore that a layered view reduces interpretative biases and that straightforward integrations of public data with open-source software yield robust introductory-level physical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Probing Time-Dependent Physics with Phase-Folding CMB Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer a powerful probe of time-dependent cosmological signals, such as a stochastic gravitational wave background passing through Earth, which imprints a time-varying deflection on the CMB, and time-dependent cosmic birefringence, which induces an oscillating polarization rotation. However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Nonlinear Systematics in Weak Lensing Surveys II: Stability and Diagnostics with Intrinsic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform provides a powerful framework for analysing tomographic cosmic shear data by improving the localization of shear correlations in physical scale. It operates by performing a linear combination of the shear data vector in $\ell$-space, yielding a transformed vector that is better localized in both redshift and $k$-space. BNT is particularly useful for estimating cosmological parameters while minimizing the impact of poorly understood nonlinear physics, without discarding large amounts of information as is typically done with simple scale cuts. In our previous work, we showed that BNT outperforms traditional weak-lensing analyses; however, that study did not include intrinsic alignments (IA). In the present work, we assess the robustness of our BNT-based $k$-cut framework in the presence of realistic IA models. We consider two cases: (i) when the assumed IA model used in sampling is close to, but not identical to, the true one, and (ii) when the assumed IA model is significantly mis-specified. In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. In the second, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in the assumed IA model across $k$- and redshift-space, indicating that the corresponding cosmological constraints cannot be trusted until a more accurate IA model is adopted.</description>

      <title>Massive Inflationary Amplitudes: New Representations and Degenerate Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle model building of cosmological collider physics often involves boost-breaking bilinear mixing between a heavy particle and the nearly massless inflaton mode. In cosmological correlators, such a mixing is obtained by taking a folded limit of a generic tree graph, which is a special case of degenerate kinematics. In this work, we continue our exploration of massive inflationary amplitudes with a focus on degenerate kinematics. With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts. In particular, the inflaton bispectrum with triple massive exchanges can be expressed in terms of a trivariate Kamp\'e de F\'eriet function and simpler hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at $z\sim~1$ and their connection with dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ, f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$.
  When compared to their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past $8$ Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\rm M}$ and $f_{\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.</description>

      <title>Did our Universe Tunnel out of the Wrong Higgs Vacuum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores various aspects and implications of the initial configuration of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field at the beginning of our Universe. It is well known that the SM Higgs field features a deeper, more stable minimum at large field values. While it is possible that our Universe began and remained in the electroweak vacuum at all times, this scenario is extremely fine-tuned from the point of view of initial conditions. This fine-tuning can be ameliorated by the exponential expansion of spacetime during inflation: intriguingly, this requires at least $\sim 40$ e-folds of inflation, tantalizingly close to the $50-60$ e-folds expected from horizon and flatness considerations. The Higgs could thus provide the reason for a prolonged epoch of inflation in our cosmic history. Otherwise, the most natural initial state corresponds to our Universe initialized in the more stable but "wrong" Higgs vacuum, and subsequently driven dynamically to the weak scale vacuum during reheating. An important, hitherto unexplored aspect of this dynamics is that the barrier between the two vacua persists when the electroweak vacuum becomes energetically favorable, becoming arbitrarily small as the temperature increases, and therefore triggers a first-order phase transition. This transition produces ultra-high (megahertz to gigahertz) frequency gravitational waves (GWs), serving as a challenging but unique SM target for GW experiments. Novel pathways for various beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as the production of dark matter and baryon asymmetry also become possible in this configuration.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We entertain the possibility that the phenomena typically attributed to dark matter may have a fundamentally emergent nature, rather than arising from new particle degrees of freedom. To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile.</description>

      <title>A Unified Dark-Matter--Driven Relativistic Bondi Route to Black-Hole Growth from Stellar to Supermassive Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of luminous quasars at $z\gtrsim7$ reveal supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with inferred masses $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^9 \, M_\odot$ formed within the first $\sim700$~Myr of cosmic history. Standard growth channels \textrm{ -- } Eddington-limited gas accretion and hierarchical mergers \textrm{ -- } face severe timescale restrictions. We consider a super-Eddington accretion mechanism aided by the Bondi accretion of a minimal model of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We demonstrate that in a {\it critical regime} with a near-relativistic sound speed, the Bondi accretion yields an accretion rate that depends only on the mass $m$ of SIDM, thus it is universal to the ambient environment. This critical accretion mechanism for $m\gtrsim 10^{-2}\; {\rm eV}$ can grow seeds as small as $10\,M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBH) in the early Universe into $10^9$ \textrm{--} $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ SMBHs by $z\sim7$ without fine-tuned environments. Therefore, given a mass distribution of PBHs and a value of $m$, the mass function of primary black holes at late time can be fully determined with masses ranging from stellar to SMBHs. This connects the microscopic physics of dark matter to astrophysical observations of black holes.</description>

      <title>Conservation of magnetic-helicity fluctuations due to spatial decorrelation of fluxes in decaying MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hosking &amp; Schekochihin (2021, Phys. Rev. X 11, 041005) have proposed that statistically isotropic decaying MHD turbulence without net magnetic helicity conserves the mean square fluctuation level of magnetic helicity in large volumes -- or, equivalently, the integral over space of the two-point correlation function of the magnetic-helicity density, denoted $I_H$. Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity. In this work, we present a theory of these boundary terms, employing a methodology analogous to that of Batchelor &amp; Proudman (1956, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 248, 369) to determine the relevant asymptotic forms of correlation functions. We find that long-range correlations of sufficient strength to violate the conservation of $I_H$ cannot develop dynamically if the evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is chosen to be local in space. Likewise, we find that such correlations cannot develop for a wide class of gauge choices that make this equation non-local (including the Coulomb gauge). Nonetheless, we also identify a class of non-local gauge choices for which correlations that are sufficiently strong to violate the conservation of $I_H$ do appear possible. We verify our theoretical predictions for the case of the Coulomb gauge with measurements of correlation functions in a high-resolution numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Phase transition during inflation and the gravitational wave signal at pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal offers a promising window into the dynamics of the early universe. The recent results from the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could be the first glimpse of such new physics. In particular, they could point to new details during inflation, which can not be probed by other means. We explore the possibility that the new results could come from the secondary GWs sourced by curvature perturbations, generated by a first-order phase transition during inflation. Based on the results of a field-theoretic lattice simulation of the phase transition process, we show that the GW signal generated through this mechanism can account for the new results from the PTAs. We analyze the spectral shape of the signal in detail. Future observations can use such information to distinguish the GW signal considered here from other possible sources.</description>

      <title>Approximate reconstruction of inflationary potential with ACT observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently reported updated measurements of the scalar spectral index $n_s$, revealing a tension with the predictions of many conventional inflationary models. In this work, we adopt a parameterization of the spectral index in the form $n_s = 1 - p/(N + \alpha)$ with $1.338&lt;p&lt;1.746$, to reconstruct an inflationary potential consistent with the latest ACT data. The resulting potential is the Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) potential $V(\phi) = V_0/[1 + (M/\phi)^n]$, where the power index is given by $n = 2(p-1)/(2-p)$. The corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio is approximately $r \approx 16(p-1)/[C (N+\alpha)^p]$ with $C= 2^{2p-1} \left[\sqrt{p-1}/(2-p)\right]^{2p-2} /M^{2p-2}$. Since the reconstruction under the slow-roll approximation is model-independent, the KKLT model can serve as an effective approximation to a broad class of inflationary scenarios that are consistent with the latest ACT measurements of $n_s$, at least on large scales.</description>

Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) belongs to a class of nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms that leverage concepts from natural selection to perform optimization tasks. In cosmology, the standard method for estimating parameters is the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, renowned for its reliability in determining cosmological parameters. This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$CDM model, we explore the impact of GA's key hyperparameters -- such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate -- on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Power Spectrum Foreground Model and Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the model of astrophysical emission at millimeter wavelengths used to characterize foregrounds in the multi-frequency power spectra of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6), expanding on Louis et al. (2025). We detail several tests to validate the capability of the DR6 parametric foreground model to describe current observations and complex simulations, and show that cosmological parameter constraints are robust against model extensions and variations. We demonstrate consistency of the model with pre-DR6 ACT data and observations from Planck and the South Pole Telescope. We evaluate the implications of using different foreground templates and extending the model with new components and/or free parameters. In all scenarios, the DR6 $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$ cosmological parameters shift by less than $0.5\sigma$ relative to the baseline constraints. Some foreground parameters shift more; we estimate their systematic uncertainties associated with modeling choices. From our constraint on the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power, we obtain a conservative limit on the duration of reionization of $\Delta z_{\rm rei} &lt; 4.4$, assuming a reionization midpoint consistent with optical depth measurements and a minimal low-redshift contribution, with varying assumptions for this component leading to tighter limits. Finally, we analyze realistic non-Gaussian, correlated microwave sky simulations containing Galactic and extragalactic foreground fields, built independently of the DR6 parametric foreground model. Processing these simulations through the DR6 power spectrum and likelihood pipeline, we recover the input cosmological parameters of the underlying cosmic microwave background field, a new demonstration for small-scale CMB analysis. These tests validate the robustness of the ACT DR6 foreground model and cosmological parameter constraints.</description>

      <title>On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of useful criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</description>

Abstract: Precise initial conditions (ICs) are crucial for accurate computation in cosmological perturbation theory. We derive the consistent ICs for Horndeski theory in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, assuming constant EFT functions at early times. We implement the ICs into the public Boltzmann code \texttt{EFTCAMB}, and demonstrate that the expected early-time behavior of perturbations and Weyl potential can be obtained with theory-consistent MG ICs. We identify significant deviations when comparing Cosmic Microwave Background angular power spectra in MG models obtained with consistent MG ICs versus inconsistent GR ICs. Our findings underline the importance of using accurate, theory-consistent MG ICs to ensure robust cosmological constraints on early MG models.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Hubble tension with a cascade decaying dark matter sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time $\Lambda$CDM. So far, extensive studies have shown that only early dark energy or ad hoc combinations of those two-fold effects can reduce the tension to $3\sigma$ level or lower. In this work, we improve the latter solution by considering a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck 2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits, neutrino flux bounds, Planck data about matter power spectrum, and structure formation constraint. Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and compatible with the existing constraints, the main phenomenological features include a larger $S_{8}\sim 0.84$, smaller $n_{s}\sim 0.95$ and larger matter power spectrum relative to the $\Lambda$CDM, which are left for future tests.</description>

      <title>Inflation from a generalized exponential plateau: towards extra suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a standard minimally-coupled scalar-field inflationary scenario, which is based on a new potential, with suitably generalized plateau features, that leads to extra small tensor-to-scalar ratios. In particular, we consider a specific three-parameter potential, which has a flatter plateau and a steeper well compared to the Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame. We study the inflationary realization and we show that it guarantees a prolonged period of slow-roll inflation and a successful exit. Additionally, the steeper minimum leads to significantly suppressed tensor perturbations, and thus to an extra-small tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and we show that we are able to obtain $r$ values less than $10^{-5}$. Moreover, we calculate the reheating temperature showing that in order to be in agreement with observations one of the potential parameters should remain within specific bounds. Finally, performing an inverse conformal transformation to the Jordan frame we show that the considered potential corresponds to higher-order corrections to Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame, and these corrections are the reason for the improved behavior of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to retrieve cosmological parameters from photometric surveys, we need to estimate the distribution of the photometric redshift in the sky with excellent accuracy. We use and apply three different machine learning methods to publicly available Dark Energy Survey data release 2 (DR2): a) Artificial Neural Network for photometric redshifts (ANNz2); b) Gaussian processes for photometric redshifts (GPz); and c) Keras, a deep learning application programming interface in Python. We compare these different techniques applied to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500 million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies, which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a $\sigma_{68}\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the order of 3 per cent.</description>

      <title>Lensing amplitude anomaly and varying electron mass alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological measurements have revealed tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, notably discrepancies in the Hubble constant and $S_8$ parameter. A modified recombination scenario involving a time-varying electron mass has been proposed as a feasible solution to the Hubble tension without exacerbating the $S_8$ tension. Recent observations have further revealed other potential deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM framework, such as non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Using the Planck Public Release (PR) 3 and ACT power spectra, Planck PR4 and ACT lensing maps, together with BAO measurements from DESI DR2, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0068}_{-0.0066}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both exceeding the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. However, when adopting the latest Planck power spectra likelihoods, NPIPE and HiLLiPoP, we obtain lower electron masses with $\Delta m_e / m_e = -0.0063^{+0.0095}_{-0.0099}$ and $-0.0095^{+0.0078}_{-0.0079}$, relieving the $S_8$ tension only. The lensing amplitude remains anomalously high, with $A_{\rm lens} = 1.053^{+0.042}_{-0.040}$ and $1.075^{+0.044}_{-0.043}$. Our results point to a promising direction for cosmological models to reconcile the aforementioned discrepancies, although more precise data from future experiments will be necessary to clarify the aforementioned modifications.</description>

      <title>Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the model\'s ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.</description>

      <title>Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.</description>

      <title>Quintessential inflation studied through Semiclassical Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we solved the scalar and tensor perturbation equations numerically and using the improved uniform approximation method together with the third-order phase-integral method, for the $\alpha$-attractor inflationary model. This inflationary model has become very important because it allows us to describe the initial accelerated expansion of the universe in the inflationary epoch, and the current accelerated expansion with the same potential that depends on one scalar field $\varphi$. Once the equations for the scalar and tensor power spectra are found, we calculate the observables: the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$, and the scalar spectral index $n_S$, concluding that semiclassical methods give excellent results compared to numerical integration. We also compare both observables in the $\alpha$-attractor and the Starobinsky inflationary model.</description>

      <title>The richest clusters in the Coma and Leo superclusters: Properties and evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the substructure, connectivity, and galaxy content of galaxy clusters A1656 and 1367 in the Coma supercluster and of A1185 in the Leo supercluster with the aim of understanding the evolution of clusters from turnaround to virialisation. We used data from the SDSS DR10 MAIN galaxy sample and from DESI cluster catalogues. The projected phase space diagram and the distribution of mass were used to identify regions of various infall stages (early and late infall, and regions of ongoing infall, i.e. regions of influence), their characteristic radii, embedded mass, and density contrasts in order to study the evolution of clusters with the spherical collapse model. We determined the substructure of clusters using normal mixture modelling and their connectivity by counting filaments in the cluster's regions of influence, analysed galaxy content of clusters, and derived scaling relations between cluster masses. All three clusters have a substructure with two to five components and up to six filaments connected to them. The radii of regions of influence are $R_\mathrm{inf} \approx 4$ Mpc, and the density contrast at their borders is $\Delta\rho_{inf} \approx 50 - 60$. The scaling relations between the masses of clusters have a very small scatter. The galaxy content of the clusters and of their regions of influence vary from cluster to cluster. In superclusters the percentage of quiescent galaxies is higher than in low-density regions between superclusters. The collapse of the regions of influence of clusters started at redshifts $z \approx 0.4 - 0.5$. Clusters will be virialised in $\approx 3.3$ Gyrs. Clusters in superclusters will not merge, and their present-day turnaround regions will be virialised in $\approx 10$ Gyrs. The large variety of properties of clusters suggests that they have followed different paths during evolution.</description>

      <title>JWST Lensed Quasar Dark Matter Survey III: Dark Matter Sensitive Flux Ratios and Warm Dark Matter Constraint from the Full Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with $m=1, m=3, \text{ and } m=4$ elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.8} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.5} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;6.9 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Non-Gaussianity of 2-point statistics likelihood: Precise analysis of the matter power spectrum distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussian features in the distribution of the matter power spectrum multipoles. Using the COVMOS method, we generate 100\,000 mock realisations of dark matter density fields in both real and redshift space across multiple redshifts and cosmological models. We derive an analytical framework linking the non-Gaussianity of the power spectrum distribution to higher-order statistics of the density field, including the trispectrum and pentaspectrum. We explore the effect of redshift-space distortions, the geometry of the survey, the Fourier binning, the integral constraint, and the shot noise on the skewness of the distribution of the power spectrum measurements. Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift. This departure is primarily driven by the pentaspectrum contribution, which dominates over the trispectrum at intermediate scales. We also examine the impact of the finiteness of the survey geometry in the context of the Euclid mission and find that both the shape of the survey and the integral constraint amplify the skewness.</description>
