      <title>Vorticity-induced surfing and trapping in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms often encounter strong confinement and complex hydrodynamic flows while navigating their habitats. Combining finite-element methods and stochastic simulations, we study the interplay of active transport and heterogeneous flows in dense porous channels. We find that swimming always slows down the traversal of agents across the channel, giving rise to robust power-law tails of their exit-time distributions. These exit-time distributions collapse onto a universal master curve with a scaling exponent of $\approx 3/2$ across a wide range of packing fractions and motility parameters, which can be rationalized by a scaling relation. We further identify a new motility pattern where agents alternate between surfing along fast streams and extended trapping phases, the latter determining the power-law exponent. Unexpectedly, trapping occurs in the flow backbone itself -- not only at obstacle boundaries -- due to vorticity-induced reorientation in the highly-heterogeneous fluid environment. These findings provide a fundamentally new active transport mechanism with direct implications for biofilm clogging and the design of novel microrobots capable of operating in heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction: a review of current methods and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the secondary structure of RNA is a core challenge in computational biology, essential for understanding molecular function and designing novel therapeutics. The field has evolved from foundational but accuracy-limited thermodynamic approaches to a new data-driven paradigm dominated by machine learning and deep learning. These models learn folding patterns directly from data, leading to significant performance gains. This review surveys the modern landscape of these methods, covering single-sequence, evolutionary-based, and hybrid models that blend machine learning with biophysics. A central theme is the field's "generalization crisis," where powerful models were found to fail on new RNA families, prompting a community-wide shift to stricter, homology-aware benchmarking. In response to the underlying challenge of data scarcity, RNA foundation models have emerged, learning from massive, unlabeled sequence corpora to improve generalization. Finally, we look ahead to the next set of major hurdles-including the accurate prediction of complex motifs like pseudoknots, scaling to kilobase-length transcripts, incorporating the chemical diversity of modified nucleotides, and shifting the prediction target from static structures to the dynamic ensembles that better capture biological function. We also highlight the need for a standardized, prospective benchmarking system to ensure unbiased validation and accelerate progress.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Computational Models of Bacterial Interactions in the simulation of Biofilm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of elongated particle interaction models, traditionally used in liquid crystal phase research, in the context of early bacterial biofilm development. Through computer simulations using an agent-based model, we have investigated the possibilities and limitations of modeling biofilm formation and growth using different models for interaction between bacteria, such as the Hertz model, Soft Repulsive Spherocylindrical (SRS) model, and attractive Kihara model. Our approach focuses on understanding how mechanical forces due to the interaction between cells, in addition to growth and diffusive parameters, influence the formation of complex bacterial communities. By comparing such force models, we evaluate their impact on the structural properties of bacterial microcolonies. The results indicate that, although the specific force model has some effect on biofilm properties, the intensity of the interaction between bacteria is the most important determinant. This study highlights the importance of properly selecting interaction strength in simulations to obtain realistic representations of biofilm growth, and suggests which adapted models of rod-shaped bacterial systems may offer a valid approach to study the dynamics of complex biofilms.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sequential therapies to maximize extinction of resistant bacteria through collateral sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities, where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how longer therapies maximize extinction but also cause higher resistance, leading to a Pareto front of optimal switching periods. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.</description>
