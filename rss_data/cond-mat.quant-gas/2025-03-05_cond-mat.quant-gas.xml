      <title>Stabilization of three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-body resonances are ubiquitous in few-body physics and are characterized by a finite lifetime before decaying into continuum states of their composing subsystems. In this work we present a theoretical study on the possibility to stabilize three-body resonances to so-called bound states in a continuum: resonances with vanishing width that do not decay. Within a simple two-channel approach we unveil the underlying mechanism and suggest that the lifetime can be varied by a continuous tuning of system parameters. The validity of our theory is illustrated in two rather different examples, a mass-imbalanced system in one dimension and a system of three identical bosons in three dimensions, relevant to Efimov physics. Crucially, for the latter we find that one of the tunable parameters to achieve a three-body bound state in a continuum is an external magnetic field, a common tunable variable in cold-atom experiments. Due to the fundamental nature of our theory, it is expected to hold in other few-body systems, possibly opening new avenues for basic studies of otherwise unstable systems, and elevating few-body systems to interesting candidates for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Interaction induced Anderson transition in a kicked one dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons subjected to periodic kicks. In both the non-interacting and strongly interacting limits, the system undergoes dynamical localization, leading to energy saturation at long times. However, for finite interactions, we reveal an interaction-driven transition from an insulating to a metallic phase at a critical kicking strength, provided the number of particles is three or more. Using the Bethe Ansatz solution of the Lieb-Liniger gas, we establish a formal correspondence between its dynamical evolution and an Anderson model in $N$ spatial dimensions, where $N$ is the number of particles. This theoretical prediction is supported by extensive numerical simulations for three particles, complemented by finite-time scaling analysis, demonstrating that this transition belongs to the orthogonal Anderson universality class.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases for Finite-Temperature Gases of Bosonic Polar Molecules Shielded by Dual Microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of polar molecules shielded by dual microwave fields using the path integral Monte Carlo method combined with the worm algorithm. We determine the critical temperature $T_c$ for Bose-Einstein condensations (BECs) and identify two distinct phases below $T_c$: the expanding gas (EG) phase and the self-bound gas (SBG) phase. We further analyze the temperature and interaction-strength dependence of the condensate and superfluid fractions. Notably, in contrast to dilute atomic BECs, the SBG phase displays a low condensate fraction and a high superfluid fraction, resembling the behavior of strongly correlated $^4$He superfluids. These significant many-body correlations arise from the interplay between long-range dipole-dipole interactions and the short-range shielding potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the gas provides a characteristic geometric signature to accurately determine the EG-to-SBG transition, robust against external trapping potentials. Our findings provide unbiased and numerically exact results to guide upcoming experiments with polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherent backscattering and coherent forward scattering effects in variations of the random quantum kicked rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate coherent multiple scattering effects in the random quantum kicked rotor model. By changing the starting time of the Floquet period, two new classes of models can be introduced that exhibit similar interference structures. For one of the two classes, these structures appear on top of a non-trivial background, which we describe in detail. Its origin is identified and an approximate analytical formula is proposed. The asymptotic contrast profile, as well as the height of the coherent backscattering and the coherent forward scattering peaks, are also analyzed. Our findings are relevant to provide an interpretation of cold atom experiments aiming at observing such interference effects with matter waves.</description>

      <title>Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics in Short-Range Quadratic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate critical transport and the dynamical exponent through the spreading of an initially localized particle in quadratic Hamiltonians with short-range hopping in lattice dimension $d_l$. We consider critical dynamics that emerges when the Thouless time, i.e., the saturation time of the mean-squared displacement, approaches the typical Heisenberg time. We establish a relation, $z=d_l/d_s$, linking the critical dynamical exponent $z$ to $d_l$ and to the spectral fractal dimension $d_s$. This result has notable implications: it says that superdiffusive transport in $d_l\geq 2$ and diffusive transport in $d_l\geq 3$ cannot be critical in the sense defined above. Our findings clarify previous results on disordered and quasiperiodic models and, through Fibonacci potential models in two and three dimensions, provide non-trivial examples of critical dynamics in systems with $d_l\neq1$ and $d_s\neq1$.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in the Two-Component Bose-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model for two-component bosons using a strong-coupling approach within the closed-time-path formalism and develop an effective theory for the action of this problem. We obtain equations of motion for the superfluid order parameters of both boson species for both the superfluid and Mott-insulating phases and study these in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit during a quantum quench for various initial conditions. We find that an additional degree of freedom for bosons leads to a richer phase diagram and out-of-equilibrium dynamics than the single-component situation.</description>

      <title>Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas in the Random Phase Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02706v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in a mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation (in its collective bosonization formulation) for the ground state. We prove that the trial state's momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i.e., a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal). Our result shows that the random phase approximation in the mean-field scaling limit is in principle sufficiently precise to identify a non-trivial Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamical interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such a setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the dynamical interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization dynamics. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.</description>
