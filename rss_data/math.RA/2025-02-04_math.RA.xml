      <title>A closer look at some cyclic semifields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that different choices of generators of the Galois group of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_{q}$ ($n\geq 3$) produce non-isotopic cyclic semifields $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[t;\sigma]/\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[t;\sigma](t^m-a)$ when $m=n$: for $n\geq m$, there are $\varphi(n)$ non-isomorphic classes of Sandler semifields $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[t;\sigma]/\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[t;\sigma](t^m-a)$, one class for each generator $\sigma$ of ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_{q})$ involved in their construction, where $\varphi$ is the Euler function. We prove that when $n=m$, two Sandler semifields constructed from different generators $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ of ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_{q})$ are not isotopic. Hence when $n=m$ there are $\varphi(m)$ non-isotopic classes of these semifields, each class belonging to one choice of generator. We then present a full parametrization of the non-isomorphic Sandler semifields of order $q^{m^2}$ with center $\mathbb{F}_q$, and nuclei $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, when $m$ is prime and $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ contains a primitive $m$th root of unity. Since for $m=n$, two Sandler semifields constructed from the same generator are isotopic if and only if they are isomorphic, this parametrizes these Sandler semifields up to isotopy, and thus the corresponding non-Desarguesian projective planes as well. Most of our results are proved in all generality for any cyclic Galois field extension.</description>

      <title>Gorenstein analogues of a projectivity criterion over group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and answer Gorenstein projective, flat, and injective analogues of a classical projectivity question for group rings under some mild additional assumptions. Although the original question, that was proposed by Jang-Hyun Jo in 2007, was for integral group rings, in this article, we deal with more general commutative base rings. We make use of the vast developments that have happened in the field of Gorenstein homological algebra over group rings in recent years, and we also improve and generalize several existing results from this area along the way.</description>

      <title>Derived operators on skew orthomodular and strong skew orthomodular posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the logic of quantum mechanics disjunctions and conjunctions can be represented by joins and meets, respectively, in an orthomodular lattice provided their entries commute. This was the reason why J. Pykacz introduced new derived operations called ''sharp'' and ''flat'' coinciding with joins and meets, respectively, for commuting elements but sharing some appropriate properties with disjunction and conjunction, respectively, in the whole orthomodular lattice in question. The problem is that orthomodular lattices need not formalize the logic of quantum mechanics since joins may not be defined provided their entries are neither comparable nor orthogonal. A corresponding fact holds for meets. Therefore, orthomodular posets are more accepted as an algebraic formalization of such a logic. The aim of the present paper is to extend the concepts of ''sharp'' and ''flat'' operations to operators in skew orthomodular and strong skew orthomodular posets. We generalize the relation of commuting elements as well as the commutator to such posets and we present some important properties of these operators and their mutual relationships. Moreover, we show that if the poset in question is even Boolean then there can be defined a ternary operator sharing the identities of a Pixley term. Finally, under some weak conditions which are automatically satisfied in Boolean algebras we show some kind of adjointness for operators formalizing conjunction and implication, respectively.</description>

      <title>Auslander regularity of $p$-adic Banach algebras via almost mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss an "almost" version of Auslander regularity and use it to prove the Auslander regularity of various Banach algebras over non-discretely valued fields appearing naturally in $p$-adic locally analytic representation theory: completed Weyl algebras, the completed enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra, and the Banach completion of the distribution algebra $D(G, K)$ for a compact $p$-adic Lie group $G$.</description>

      <title>Categorification of characteristic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a representation theory of categories as a means to explore characteristic structures in algebra. Characteristic structures play a critical role in isomorphism testing of groups and algebras, and their construction and description often rely on specific knowledge of the parent object and its automorphisms. In many cases, questions of reproducibility and comparison arise. Here we present a categorical framework that addresses these questions. We prove that every characteristic structure is the image of a functor equipped with a natural transformation. This shifts the local description in the parent object to a global one in the ambient category. Through constructions in representation theory, such as tensor products, we can combine characteristic structure across multiple categories. Our results are constructive, stated in the language of a constructive type theory, which facilitates implementations in theorem checkers.</description>

      <title>Generating Sets of Stochastic Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions 2 and 3 by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</description>

      <title>First-order factors of linear Mahler operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and compare two algorithms for computing first-order right-hand factors in the ring of linear Mahler operators$\ell_r M^r + \dots + \ell_1 M + \ell_0$where $\ell_0, \dots, \ell_r$ are polynomials in~$x$ and $Mx = x^b M$ for some integer $b \geq 2$. In other words, we give algorithms for finding all formal infinite product solutions of linear functional equations$\ell_r(x) f(x^{b^r}) + \dots + \ell_1(x) f(x^b) + \ell_0(x) f(x) = 0$. The first of our algorithms is adapted from Petkov\v{s}ek's classical algorithm forthe analogous problem in the case of linear recurrences. The second one proceeds by computing a basis of generalized power series solutions of the functional equation and by using Hermite-Pad{\'e} approximants to detect those linear combinations of the solutions that correspond to first-order factors. We present implementations of both algorithms and discuss their use in combination with criteria from the literature to prove the differential transcendence of power series solutions of Mahler equations.</description>

      <title>Sweedler theory for double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish certain enrichments of dual algebraic structures in the setting of monoidal double categories. In more detail, we obtain a tensored and cotensored enrichment of monads in comonads, as well as a tensored and cotensored enrichment of modules in comodules, under very general conditions on the surrounding double category. These include `monoidal closedness' and `local presentability', leading classical notions which are here introduced in the double categorical context. Furthermore, we show that in this setting, the actual fibration of modules over monads is itself enriched in the opfibration of comodules over comonads. Applying this abstract double categorical framework to the setting of V-matrices, one directly obtains a many-object generalization of the known enrichment of modules over monoids in comodules over comonoids in a monoidal category V, which was originally induced by Sweedler's measuring k-coalgebras in vector spaces. In the present setting the result involves V-enriched modules of V-categories and V-enriched comodules of V-cocategories.</description>
