      <title>Partially Ordered Sets Corresponding to the Partition Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partition problem is a well-known basic NP-complete problem. We mainly consider the optimization version of it in this paper. The problem has been investigated from various perspectives for a long time and can be solved efficiently in practice. Hence, we might say that the only remaining task is to decide whether the problem can be solved in polynomial time in the number $n$ of given integers.
  We propose two partially ordered sets (posets) and present a novel methodology for solving the partition problem. The first poset is order-isomorphic to a well-known poset whose structures are related to the solutions of the subset sum problem, while the second is a subposet of the first and plays a crucial role in this paper. We first show several properties of the two posets, such as size, height and width (the largest size of a subset consisting of incomparable elements). Both widths are the same and $O(2^n / n^{3/2})$ for $n$ congruent to $0$ or $3$ (mod $4$). This fact indicates the hardness of the partition problem. We then prove that in general all the candidate solutions correspond to the elements of the second poset, whose size is $2^{n} - 2 \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$. Since a partition corresponds to two elements of the poset, the number of the candidate partitions is half of it, that is, $2^{n-1} - \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$. We finally prove that the candidate solutions can be reduced based on the partial order. In particular, we give several polynomially solvable cases by considering the minimal elements of the second poset.
  Our approach offers a valuable tool for structural analysis of the partition problem and provides a new perspective on the P versus NP problem.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. The Four Color Theorem. Theory, methods, algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Four color problem is closely related to other branches of mathematics and practical applications. More than 20 of its reformulations are known, which connect this problem with problems of algebra, statistical mechanics and planning. And this is also typical for mathematics: the solution to a problem studied out of pure curiosity turns out to be useful in representing real objects and processes that are completely different in nature. Despite the published machine methods for combinatorial proof of the Four color conjecture, there is still no clear description of the mechanism for coloring a planar graph with four colors, its natural essence and its connection with the phenomenon of graph planarity. It is necessary not only to prove (preferably by deductive methods) that any planar graph can be colored with four colors, but also to show how to color it. The paper considers an approach based on the possibility of reducing a maximally flat graph to a regular flat cubic graph with its further coloring. Based on the Tate-Volynsky theorem, the vertices of a maximally flat graph can be colored with four colors, if the edges of its dual cubic graph can be colored with three colors. Considering the properties of a colored cubic graph, it can be shown that the addition of colors obeys the transformation laws of the fourth order Klein group. Using this property, it is possible to create algorithms for coloring planar graphs.</description>

Abstract: We popularize the question whether (for large $m$) all $m$-uniform shift-chain hypergraphs are (properly) $2$-colorable. On the other hand, we show that for every $m$ some $m$-uniform shift-chains are not polychromatic $3$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Automatic question generation for propositional logical equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in academic dishonesty cases among college students has raised concern, particularly due to the shift towards online learning caused by the pandemic. We aim to develop and implement a method capable of generating tailored questions for each student. The use of Automatic Question Generation (AQG) is a possible solution. Previous studies have investigated AQG frameworks in education, which include validity, user-defined difficulty, and personalized problem generation. Our new AQG approach produces logical equivalence problems for Discrete Mathematics, which is a core course for year-one computer science students. This approach utilizes a syntactic grammar and a semantic attribute system through top-down parsing and syntax tree transformations. Our experiments show that the difficulty level of questions generated by our AQG approach is similar to the questions presented to students in the textbook [1]. These results confirm the practicality of our AQG approach for automated question generation in education, with the potential to significantly enhance learning experiences.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of Multisets with Applications to Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the reconfiguration framework to analyze problems that involve the rearrangement of items among groups. In various applications, a group of items could correspond to the files or jobs assigned to a particular machine, and the goal of rearrangement could be improving efficiency or increasing locality.
  To cover problems arising in a wide range of application areas, we define the general Repacking problem as the rearrangement of multisets of multisets. We present hardness results for the general case and algorithms for various classes of instances that arise in real-life scenarios. By limiting the total size of items in each multiset, our results can be viewed as an offline approach to Bin Packing, in which each bin is represented as a multiset.
  In addition to providing the first results on reconfiguration of multisets, our contributions open up several research avenues: the interplay between reconfiguration and online algorithms and parallel algorithms; the use of the tools of linear programming in reconfiguration; and, in the longer term, a focus on resources in reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Computing $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAGs and Parity Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treewidth on undirected graphs is known to have many algorithmic applications. When considering directed width-measures there are much less results on their deployment for algorithmic results. In 2022 the first author, Rabinovich and Wiederrecht introduced a new directed width measure, $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAG-width, using directed separations and obtained a structural duality for it. In 2012 Berwanger~et~al.~solved Parity Games in polynomial time on digraphs of bounded DAG-width. With generalising this result to digraphs of bounded $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAG-width and also providing an algorithm to compute the $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAG-width of a given digraphs we give first algorithmical results for this new parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between mixing properties for bipartite graphs and materialization of the mutual information in one-shot settings. We show that mixing properties of a graph imply impossibility to extract the mutual information shared by the ends of an edge randomly sampled in the graph. We apply these impossibility results to some questions motivated by information-theoretic cryptography. In particular, we show that communication complexity of a secret key agreement in one-shot setting is inherently uneven: for some inputs, almost all communication complexity inevitably falls on only one party.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $G$ is a nilpotent group and $[G,G]$ has Hirsch length $1$, then every f.g. submonoid of $G$ is boundedly generated, i.e. a product of cyclic submonoids. Using a reduction of Bodart, this implies the decidability of the submonoid membership problem for nilpotent groups $G$ where $[G,G]$ has Hirsch length $2$.</description>

      <title>Federated Combinatorial Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a federated learning framework tailored for online combinatorial optimization with bandit feedback. In this setting, agents select subsets of arms, observe noisy rewards for these subsets without accessing individual arm information, and can cooperate and share information at specific intervals. Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, having a complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\psi}{\epsilon^\beta})$, where the logarithm is omitted, for some function $\psi$ and constant $\beta$, into an online multi-agent algorithm with $m$ communicating agents and an $\alpha$-regret of no more than $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m^{-\frac{1}{3+\beta}} \psi^\frac{1}{3+\beta} T^\frac{2+\beta}{3+\beta})$. This approach not only eliminates the $\epsilon$ approximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the time horizon $T$ and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number of communicating agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notably communication-efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of communication rounds, quantified as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\psi T^\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$. Furthermore, the framework has been successfully applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using various offline algorithms, yielding the first results for both single-agent and multi-agent settings and recovering specialized single-agent theoretical guarantees. We empirically validate our approach to a stochastic data summarization problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework, even in single-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spectral Triadic Decompositions of Real-World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in mathematics and network analysis is to find conditions under which a graph can be partitioned into smaller pieces. The most important tool for this partitioning is the Fiedler vector or discrete Cheeger inequality. These results relate the graph spectrum (eigenvalues of the normalized adjacency matrix) to the ability to break a graph into two pieces, with few edge deletions. An entire subfield of mathematics, called spectral graph theory, has emerged from these results. Yet these results do not say anything about the rich community structure exhibited by real-world networks, which typically have a significant fraction of edges contained in numerous densely clustered blocks. Inspired by the properties of real-world networks, we discover a new spectral condition that relates eigenvalue powers to a network decomposition into densely clustered blocks. We call this the \emph{spectral triadic decomposition}. Our relationship exactly predicts the existence of community structure, as commonly seen in real networked data. Our proof provides an efficient algorithm to produce the spectral triadic decomposition. We observe on numerous social, coauthorship, and citation network datasets that these decompositions have significant correlation with semantically meaningful communities.</description>

      <title>An Enumerative Perspective on Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connectivity (or equivalently, unweighted maximum flow) is an important measure in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Given a graph $G$ with vertices $s$ and $t$, the connectivity $\lambda(s,t)$ from $s$ to $t$ is defined to be the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.
  Much research has gone into designing fast algorithms for computing connectivities in graphs. Previous work showed that it is possible to compute connectivities for all pairs of vertices in directed graphs with $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time [Chueng, Lau, and Leung, FOCS 2011], where $\omega \in [2,2.3716)$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. For the related problem of computing "small connectivities," it was recently shown that for any positive integer $k$, we can compute $\min(k,\lambda(s,t))$ for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$ in a directed graph with $n$ nodes in $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time [Akmal and Jin, ICALP 2023].
  In this paper, we present an alternate exposition of these $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ and $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time algorithms, with simpler proofs of correctness. Earlier proofs were somewhat indirect, introducing an elegant but ad hoc "flow vector framework" for showing correctness of these algorithms. In contrast, we observe that these algorithms for computing exact and small connectivity values can be interpreted as testing whether certain generating functions enumerating families of edge-disjoint paths are nonzero. This new perspective yields more transparent proofs, and ties the approach for these problems more closely to the literature surrounding algebraic graph algorithms.</description>

      <title>From Trees to Polynomials and Back Again: New Capacity Bounds with Applications to TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give simply exponential lower bounds on the probabilities of a given strongly Rayleigh distribution, depending only on its expectation. This resolves a weak version of a problem left open by Karlin-Klein-Oveis Gharan in their recent breakthrough work on metric TSP, and this resolution leads to a minor improvement of their approximation factor for metric TSP. Our results also allow for a more streamlined analysis of the algorithm.
  To achieve these new bounds, we build upon the work of Gurvits-Leake on the use of the productization technique for bounding the capacity of a real stable polynomial. This technique allows one to reduce certain inequalities for real stable polynomials to products of affine linear forms, which have an underlying matrix structure. In this paper, we push this technique further by characterizing the worst-case polynomials via bipartitioned forests. This rigid combinatorial structure yields a clean induction argument, which implies our stronger bounds.
  In general, we believe the results of this paper will lead to further improvement and simplification of the analysis of various combinatorial and probabilistic bounds and algorithms.</description>
