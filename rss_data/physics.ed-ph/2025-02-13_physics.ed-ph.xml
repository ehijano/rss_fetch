      <title>The Role of Conceptual Problem Solving in Learning Physics: A Study in a General Relativity University Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective physics learning, especially in complex topics, requires balancing mathematical formalism with conceptual understanding. Conceptual problem-solving involves connecting math to physical reality, and using an epistemological framework like problem framing helps students justify their mathematical decisions. This approach deepens students' understanding by linking theory to practice and enhancing their reasoning skills. This study explores the effectiveness of conceptual problem-solving in learning complex topics like general relativity (GR) through a pedagogical framework that emphasizes the integration of qualitative and quantitative reasoning. Our investigation, conducted at the University of Cagliari, assessed how students structure their problem framing and its impact on their conceptual learning of GR. Results indicate that students who blend conceptual understanding with mathematical formalism show a deeper grasp of physical principles and improved problem-solving skills. The research highlights the importance of symbol sense and the cyclical nature of problem framing, suggesting that a more integrated approach, incorporating visual, symbolic, and natural language elements, could enhance students' conceptual understanding. Additionally, the methodology provides instructors with insights into students' thought processes, enabling more effective, targeted feedback.</description>
