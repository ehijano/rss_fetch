      <title>Galerkin Method of Regularized Stokeslets for Procedural Fluid Flow with Control Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new procedural incompressible velocity field authoring tool, which lets users design a volumetric flow by directly specifying velocity along control curves. Our method combines the Method of Regularized Stokeslets with Galerkin discretization. Based on the highly viscous Stokes flow assumption, we find the force along a given set of curves that satisfies the velocity constraints along them. We can then evaluate the velocity anywhere inside the surrounding infinite 2D or 3D domain. We also show the extension of our method to control the angular velocity along control curves. Compared to a collocation discretization, our method is not very sensitive to the vertex sampling rate along control curves and only requires a small linear system solve.</description>

      <title>Localized Evaluation for Constructing Discrete Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological abstractions offer a method to summarize the behavior of vector fields but computing them robustly can be challenging due to numerical precision issues. One alternative is to represent the vector field using a discrete approach, which constructs a collection of pairs of simplices in the input mesh that satisfies criteria introduced by Forman's discrete Morse theory. While numerous approaches exist to compute pairs in the restricted case of the gradient of a scalar field, state-of-the-art algorithms for the general case of vector fields require expensive optimization procedures. This paper introduces a fast, novel approach for pairing simplices of two-dimensional, triangulated vector fields that do not vary in time. The key insight of our approach is that we can employ a local evaluation, inspired by the approach used to construct a discrete gradient field, where every simplex in a mesh is considered by no more than one of its vertices. Specifically, we observe that for any edge in the input mesh, we can uniquely assign an outward direction of flow. We can further expand this consistent notion of outward flow at each vertex, which corresponds to the concept of a downhill flow in the case of scalar fields. Working with outward flow enables a linear-time algorithm that processes the (outward) neighborhoods of each vertex one-by-one, similar to the approach used for scalar fields. We couple our approach to constructing discrete vector fields with a method to extract, simplify, and visualize topological features. Empirical results on analytic and simulation data demonstrate drastic improvements in running time, produce features similar to the current state-of-the-art, and show the application of simplification to large, complex flows.</description>

      <title>Personalized Video Relighting With an At-Home Light Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a personalized video relighting algorithm that produces high-quality and temporally consistent relit videos under any pose, expression, and lighting condition in real-time. Existing relighting algorithms typically rely either on publicly available synthetic data, which yields poor relighting results, or on actual light stage data which is difficult to acquire. We show that by just capturing recordings of a user watching YouTube videos on a monitor we can train a personalized algorithm capable of performing high-quality relighting under any condition. Our key contribution is a novel image-based neural relighting architecture that effectively separates the intrinsic appearance features - the geometry and reflectance of the face - from the source lighting and then combines them with the target lighting to generate a relit image. This neural architecture enables smoothing of intrinsic appearance features leading to temporally stable video relighting. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our architecture improves portrait image relighting quality and temporal consistency over state-of-the-art approaches on both casually captured `Light Stage at Your Desk' (LSYD) and light-stage-captured `One Light At a Time' (OLAT) datasets.</description>
