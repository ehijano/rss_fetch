      <title>Narrowing Down Sources of High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting gravitational waves above 100 kHz would constitute a major discovery, as any observable signal would have to arise from new physics within the late universe. Although many technologies have been identified to explore this high-frequency regime, the known landscape of promising sources remains extremely sparse. In this work, we aim to rectify this issue by providing model-independent arguments that highlight the most interesting parts of theory space, while remaining agnostic of the specific signal mechanism. For example, energy-conservation implies that gravitational waves detectable by future experiments well above a MHz would most likely have to originate from within the Solar System. Based on these arguments, we also constrain the physical properties of such sources.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Returns: Optimizing Experimental Observables at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that integrates both analytical and machine-learning approaches for calculating observables optimal for EFT and broader applications at the LHC. A new metric for evaluating the performance of these approaches has been introduced. In addition, we demonstrate how the majority of relevant information can be effectively stored in a limited number of bins, allowing for efficient data analysis, data preservation, and global data combination, while also providing tools to achieve these benefits. A key feature of this approach is the reduction in the dimensionality of the observable information, which enhances both the effectiveness and practicality of the data analysis while maximizing gains within limited resources. These features have been demonstrated through simulated analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay processes at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Topic Modeling in New Physics Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply topic modeling to detect new physics in proton-proton collisions at the LHC in an unsupervised way. We investigate three new physics scenarios where fully leptonic $t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\ell^+\ell^-\nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ is the main source of background without relying on jet substructure variables. We demonstrate that the algorithm remains effective even in this low-particle multiplicity framework, complementing jet tagging studies, where it is typically employed. Moreover, we demonstrate that the performance of topic modeling is competitive or even better than well-known outlier detectors, such as isolation forest and variational autoencoders, with moderate and high background pollution in almost all new physics scenarios considered.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity of Higgs Factories to Composite Higgs Models via Precision Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of precision Higgs factory measurements to discover signatures of a representative model of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs boson arises as a composite Nambu-Goldstone boson. In this model, as in other models of the ``Little Higgs" or Natural Composite Higgs type, the primary perturbations of the Standard Model come from effects of vectorlike top quark partners. We carry out an explicit calculation of the Higgs potential in this model. Applying phenomenological constraints, we are left with a 3-dimensional parameter space. We then present results from a complete scan of this parameter space. The region in which significant departures from the Standard Model predictions extends to models in which the lightest top quark partner has a mass above 3~TeV. Little Higgs models with such heavy top partners also predict significant deviations from the Standard Model in the top quark electroweak couplings, in particular, in the model studied here, in the $t_L$ coupling to the $Z$ boson.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Heavy Quarkonia in a Rotating and Anisotropic Quark-Gluon Plasma: A Holographic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the in-medium spectral functions and effective masses of heavy quarkonia charmonium ($J/\Psi$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon(1S)$) in a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) possessing both global rotation and spatial anisotropy. Using a gauge/gravity holographic model incorporating finite temperature, chemical potential, and warp factor, we compute the spectral signatures non-perturbatively. Our results show that both rotation and anisotropy enhance quarkonium dissociation, manifesting as peak suppression and width broadening in the spectral functions. Crucially, their effects are directional: anisotropy primarily dissociates longitudinally polarized states, while rotation more strongly disrupts transversely polarized ones. A competitive interplay exists: for small anisotropy, rotational effects dominate at high angular velocity, whereas for large anisotropy, anisotropy governs the dissociation regardless of rotation strength. Furthermore, rotation induces a non-monotonic temperature dependence in the transverse effective mass of $J/\Psi$, while strong anisotropy causes similar non-monotonicity in the longitudinal effective mass of $J/\Psi$. These findings reveal how the distinct symmetry breaking patterns induced by QGP rotation and anisotropy reshape the heavy quarkonium spectrum, providing new insights into polarization-dependent suppression in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of $\rho$-meson in symmetric nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of the light vector \(\rho\) meson in the presence of a symmetric nuclear medium at zero temperature. We calculate the mass and decay constant of the $\rho$-meson as well as the leading twist distribution amplitudes (DAs) in the light-front quark model in vacuum, which are further investigated at different baryonic densities. We also predict the Mellin moments of the DAs and decay width of the $\rho^0 \to e^+ e^-$ process in both vacuum and medium. The evolution of DAs is carried out by the leading order (LO) Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage method and compared with available predictions. For better understanding of medium effects on $\rho$-meson, we have also predicted the in-medium charge ($G_C(Q^2)$), magnetic ($G_M(Q^2)$), and quadrupole ($G_Q(Q^2)$) form factors. The in-medium charge radii, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment have also been predicted in this work. We have found that the nuclear medium induces appreciable modifications on the mass, weak decay constant, decay width, and distribution amplitudes of the \(\rho\) meson. However, the charge radii, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment are observed to exhibit weaker sensitivity to changes in baryonic density.</description>

      <title>The properties of strange quark matter and evolution of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of strange quark matter and reveal the evolution process of strange quark stars employing a self consistent thermodynamic treatment. A comprehensive and reliable thermodynamic basis for the study of the dynamic evolution from proto-strange quark stars to stable strange stars at a zero temperature is provided. The relative abundance of particles, equation of state, temperature, and mass-radius relationship at each stage of the evolution of stars are discussed, where the cold strange quark star are consistent with the observational mass and radius of Hess J1731-347, PSR J1231-1411, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0348+0432, and PSR J0740+6620, which could be difficult to be explained by the standard neutron star model. A schematic diagram is provided as well, illustrating the state of different stages along the evolution of stars at a fixed baryon-mass.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of charm quarks produced in the early stage of pA collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the build-up of elliptic flow of charm quarks produced in the early pre-equilibrium stage of high-energy proton--nucleus collisions. The initial stage is modeled within the Color Glass Condensate framework as an evolving glasma, initialized through the McLerran--Venugopalan model. Subnucleonic fluctuations have been implemented as constituent-quark hotspots for both the proton and the nuclear participants. Charm quarks are propagated in the evolving non-Abelian background by solving the relativistic Wong equations for their coordinates, momenta, and color charges. First, we compute the nuclear modification factor of charm quarks, finding a slight migration towards higher $p_T$ states in agreement with previous results in the literature. Then, we focus on the azimuthal anisotropies acquired through the interaction with glasma fields. We find that glasma-induced momentum anisotropies are efficiently transmitted to heavy quarks within $\tau \sim 0.4~\mathrm{fm/c}$, leading to a sizeable charm-quark $v_2$, with a magnitude that increases with the strength of the initial fields and with the number of nuclear participants. Remarkably, we show that the early-stage contribution alone can account for a significant fraction of the experimentally observed $J/\psi$ elliptic flow in p-Pb collisions, indicating that pre-hydrodynamic dynamics can play a non-negligible role in the final-state heavy-flavor collectivity, especially in small systems.</description>

      <title>HL-LHC sensitivity to an ultraheavy $S_{uu}$ diquark in the $u\chi$ channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the HL-LHC sensitivity to an ultraheavy diquark $S_{uu}$ produced in up-quark fusion and decaying as $S_{uu}\to u\chi$, $\chi\to Wb, Zt, h^0t$. For fully hadronic decays of the W, Z and top quark, this gives rise to multijet final states. Within the same model framework used previously for the $S_{uu}\to\chi\chi$ six-jet channel, we consider $S_{uu}$ masses in the multi-TeV range and vectorlike quark masses of order a few TeV, and simulate proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt s = 13.6$ TeV with integrated luminosities up to the HL-LHC target. The analysis strategy employs a machine-learning-based discriminant adapted from the six-jet study to the new four-jet topology, which we use to derive the corresponding discovery reaches and exclusion limits. We find that this topology improves the overall sensitivity to $S_{uu}$ in regions where the branching ratio $B(S_{uu}\to u\chi)$ is sizable and provides a complementary signature for studying ultraheavy diquarks at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise QED radiative corrections for low- and high-energy electron-positron colliders are essential for accurate simulations of luminosity processes and precision tests of the Standard Model. We review the historical formulation and the recent developments of the BabaYaga@NLO event generator, which implements a QED Parton Shower matched with fixed-order calculations. We discuss the theoretical formulation of the code, as well as the assessment of its theoretical accuracy. Applications at low- and high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders are presented, including latest result, together with the perspectives for future improvements, in view of the demanding precision requirements of future machines at the intensity frontier.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the jet quenching parameter near the critical temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the jet quenching parameter ${\hat q}$ by using a background field effective theory. Particular attention is paid to its behavior near the critical temperature where nonperturbative effects induced by the deconfining phase transition are taken into account through a self-consistently introduced background field ${\cal Q}$. We adopt a theoretical approach in which the interaction rate between the energetic jet and medium partons is computed diagrammatically and the hard-thermal-loop resummed propagator is used to regulate the infrared divergence. In the presence of a background field, its influence on the jet quenching parameter manifests in two aspects. One is the modification on the screening mass in the resummed propagator, which leads to an enhanced ${\hat q}$. The other corresponds to the ${\cal Q}$-modified parton distribution function which is dominant and leads to a suppression of ${\hat q}$. Decreasing the temperature $T$, our result shows a non-monotonic $T$-dependence of the dimensionless ${\hat q}/T^3$. In the high temperature region, ${\hat q}/T^3$ shows an increase with decreasing $T$ due to the running coupling effect. Near the critical temperature, the background field plays a significant role and a dramatic suppression of ${\hat q}/T^3$ is found which qualitatively agrees with the Lattice simulation. In addition, the background field modification on the jet quenching parameter which is characterized by the ${\hat q}$-ratio can be simply parameterized by a polynomial expression depending only on the background field. This expression is expected to be useful for phenomenological applications in jet physics.</description>

      <title>Hadronic tau decays at higher orders in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate higher-order perturbative corrections to hadronic $\tau$ decays by applying nonlinear sequence-transformation techniques to the QCD correction $\delta^{(0)}$. In particular, we employ the Shanks transformation and several of its generalisations constructed through Wynn's $\varepsilon$-algorithm, which are known to accelerate the convergence of slowly convergent or divergent series. These methods are used to extract higher-order information from the fixed-order perturbative expansion of $\delta^{(0)}$. Within this framework, we estimate the perturbative coefficients $c_{5,1}$-$c_{12,1}$. In particular, we obtain $c_{5,1}=294^{+41}_{-21}$, $c_{6,1}=3415^{+450}_{-467}$, and $c_{7,1}=2.23^{+0.75}_{-0.49}\times 10^4$, where the quoted uncertainties reflect the spread among the different sequence transformations employed. Our analysis demonstrates that Shanks-type sequence transformations based on Wynn's $\varepsilon$-algorithm provide an efficient and systematic tool for probing higher-order perturbative effects in hadronic $\tau$ decays in the absence of explicit multi-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Measurements of H$\to\tau\tau$ cross-section at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Future Circular Collider (FCC) stands at the forefront of the European Strategy for Particle Physics as the future flagship project at CERN. The H$\to\tau\tau$ decay, featuring a large branching ratio, clean identification in the FCC-ee environment, and the possibility to reconstruct polarization information, is an excellent channel to measure Higgs properties. This work shows the expected precision for the H$\to\tau\tau$ cross-section measurement at the FCC-ee in the ZH production mechanism at $\sqrt{s}=$240 GeV and $\sqrt{s}=$365 GeV, as well as via the vector boson fusion process at $\sqrt{s}=$365 GeV. Furthermore, we explore and evaluate a set of methods for reconstructing tau decays. These techniques are critical for unlocking the full physics potential of the FCC-ee and for improving the understanding of tau-related observables in both Standard Model measurements and New Physics searches. The results obtained significantly enhance the FCC-ee outlook in the H$\to\tau\tau$ channel, improving it by at least an order of magnitude compared to the current sensitivity of measurements' performance at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Energy levels of multiscale bound states from QED energy-momentum trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy levels of QED bound states, which depend on a number of independent mass parameters, can be calculated as matrix elements of the QED energy-momentum trace. As an example of such system we consider muonic hydrogen. The leading one-loop corrections to its energy levels depend on the electron and muon masses. These corrections are calculated as matrix elements of the energy-momentum trace. Respective one-loop trace diagrams are different from the standard Lamb shift diagrams. We explain analytically and diagrammatically why two different sets of diagrams lead to the same results. Similar relationships should also hold beyond the one-loop approximation.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Contour Deformations with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of contour deformation for the numerical evaluation of Feynman integrals after sector decomposition. In existing codes, the contour of integration is determined heuristically for each phase-space point by sampling the integrand. In this work, we introduce a method for choosing the contour deformation for an entire phase-space region using only an initial sampling or training step. We demonstrate that the resulting integrand has a lower variance than that obtained with heuristic methods and show that optimising a contour to reduce the estimated error of a Quasi-Monte Carlo sample is an ill-defined problem. The a priori knowledge of the integration path obtained in this work can be used to improve the speed of conventional integration methods or be leveraged for integration using neural networks, where, crucially, it removes the need to retrain the neural network for each phase-space point. The techniques described in this work can be adapted to other problems where a non-trivial integration path has to be chosen subject to a set of constraints.</description>

      <title>The gravitational wave landscape of cosmic string networks with varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fully classify the phenomenology of gravitational wave emission from scaling cosmic string networks with varying tension and compute the spectral indices of the resulting stochastic backgrounds. In string compactifications, periods of varying tension occur when moduli acquire a time-dependence. We present concrete examples in type IIB string theory as D3- and NS5- branes wrapping internal cycles, which become dynamical due to the effect of moduli potentials. Moreover, we use Swampland constraints to derive general bounds on the allowed time-variation of the effective string tension in FLRW backgrounds and on the resulting spectral indices.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimisation for Bayesian evidence (BOBE) -- a fast and efficient likelihood emulator for model selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of Bayesian model selection provides a very elegant way of ranking different physical models in terms of how compatible they are with a given set of observed data. However, its practical application is often hampered by the challenge of having to compute the Bayesian evidence - a multi-dimensional integral over the product of likelihood and prior probability. This usually necessitates a large number of function calls to the likelihood, which may become prohibitive in case of "slow", costly to evaluate likelihoods. A possible solution to this problem lies in approximating the slow full likelihood by a fast emulated likelihood. In this paper, we introduce BOBE (Bayesian Optimisation for Bayesian Evidence), a method to construct a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based emulator. BOBE utilises a Bayesian Optimisation algorithm designed specifically to (i) provide a realistic estimate of the emulator's uncertainty and its impact on the evidence calculation, and (ii) minimise the number of likelihood evaluations required in order to meet a given evidence accuracy goal. We apply it to a number of toy examples as well as actual cosmological likelihoods, and demonstrate that training the emulator to a sufficient accuracy takes a factor of $O(10^3)$ fewer direct likelihood evaluations than would be needed if one were to directly compute the evidence integral via nested sampling. BOBE's overhead is independent of the likelihood computation time $t_L$, making it particularly useful for "expensive" likelihoods with $t_L \gtrsim 1$~s. BOBE is written in Python, supports MPI parallelisation, takes advantage of automatic differentiation and just-in-time-compilation provided by JAX, can straightforwardly be implemented with cosmological data analysis frameworks such as Cobaya, and is available for download from https://github.com/Ameek94/BOBE.</description>

      <title>Fine-tunings in radiative $\alpha$-particle capture on $^{12}$C at astrophysical energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fine-tuning of radiative alpha-particle capture on carbon, $\alpha(^{12}{\rm C},^{16}{\rm O})\gamma$, at astrophysical energies. Utilizing results from cluster effective field theory for this reaction, we find that the low-energy data of the astrophysical S-factor allow for only very small variations in the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$, namely $|\delta \alpha/\alpha| \leq 0.2\,$ per mille, in both the $E1$ and the $E2$ radiative capture.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Search with 7.8 Tonne-Year of Ionization-Only Data in XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a blinded search for dark matter (DM) using ionization-only (S2-only) signals in XENONnT with a total exposure of $7.83\mathrm{tonne}\times\mathrm{year}$ over 579 days in three science runs. Dedicated background suppression techniques and the first complete S2-only background model in XENONnT provide sensitivity to nuclear recoils of [0.5, 5.0] $\mathrm{keV_\mathrm{nr}}$ and electronic recoils of [0.04, 0.7] $\mathrm{keV_\mathrm{ee}}$. No significant excess over the expected background is observed, and we set 90\% confidence level upper limits on spin-independent DM--nucleon and spin-dependent DM--neutron scattering for DM masses between 3 and 8 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, as well as on DM--electron scattering, axion-like particles, and dark photons, improving on previous constraints. For spin-independent DM--nucleon scattering, we exclude cross sections above $6.0\times10^{-45} $cm$^2$ at a DM mass of 5 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, pushing the XENONnT sensitivity closer to the region where coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering ($\text{CE}\nu\text{NS}$) becomes an irreducible background.</description>

      <title>Constraining the inflaton potential with gravitational waves from oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under certain conditions, the oscillating inflaton condensate filling the Universe after inflation can fragment and form so-called oscillons. These long-lived soliton-like field configurations can dominate the Universe for several $e$-folds of expansion, leading to an early matter-dominated phase preceding the standard radiation era. In this paper we show how the rapid final decay of the oscillons leads to an enhanced production of induced gravitational waves, whose energy density can saturate the observational bound on the effective number of relativistic species. We leverage this bound to constrain the inflaton mass, cubic, and quartic self-coupling in generic models that admit oscillon formation, providing novel and complementary constraints in regions of parameter space that are inaccessible with cosmic microwave background observations alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that QCD-like gauge dynamics can be consistently embedded within the Dark Technicolor paradigm by invoking the extended Most Attractive Channel hypothesis, thereby revitalizing conventional technicolor scenarios. In this framework, the Higgs mass is generated dynamically while remaining consistent with electroweak precision tests, including constraints from the $S$ parameter. The flavor problem is resolved by incorporating the Standard Hierarchical VEVs Model, whereas a simple Froggatt--Nielsen construction is shown to be incompatible. Couplings of techni-hadrons such as $\rho_{\rm TC}$ and $\eta_{\rm TC}^\prime$ to Standard Model fermions are highly suppressed, leading to negligible direct fermionic signatures. Nevertheless, DTC mesons remain testable at the HL-LHC, HE-LHC, and future 100~TeV collider, with promising discovery channels including $\bar{b}b$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, $t\bar{t}$, and $\gamma\gamma$.</description>

      <title>A Step in Flux to Suppress Axion Isocurvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.</description>

      <title>New opportunities for rare charm from $Z\to c\bar{c}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the potential of rare charm decays as probes of new physics at a high-luminosity flavor facility operating at the $Z$ pole, such as the FCC-ee or CEPC. In particular, we identify clean null-test observables in $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \nu\bar{\nu}$ and in polarized $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays with $\ell=e, \mu$. Complementarity with the LHC and HL-LHC flavor programs arises from the characteristic features of a Tera-$Z$ environment: the capability to study missing-energy modes and charm production with significant polarization. We improve the theoretical description of $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \nu\bar{\nu}$ decays and work out the phenomenology of polarization-induced null-test observables in $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays. In regions of dilepton mass near the $\phi$ resonance, polarization asymmetries can reach $O(5 \%)$ for muons and $O(14 \%)$ for electrons times the $\Lambda_c^+$ polarization. We also point out synergies between the dineutrino and the dilepton modes using the SMEFT framework of heavy new physics. Using the IDEA detector concept at FCC-ee, we find in simulation studies that dineutrino branching fractions as low as $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}$ can be probed, which reaches well into the parameter space of new physics, and also allows for discrimination of lepton flavor structures. Furthermore, the measurement of asymmetries in $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \mu^+ \mu^-$ at $O(1 \%)$ will be possible. Similar sensitivities are expected for dielectron final states, although robust predictions will require further dedicated studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a 331 model, based on $\beta=-1/\sqrt{3}$, with three $SU(3)$ triplets with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting scalar potential is commonly used in phenomenology. We systematically determine all the potential minima and obtain the conditions under which the electroweak vacuum is global with the help of orbit space methods. For the case the electroweak vacuum is not global, we calculate bounds on the scalar couplings from metastability. We find a parametrisation of the potential couplings in terms of physical quantities and use it to show the available parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects can have significant cosmological consequences, so their production must be examined carefully. It is usually assumed that topological defects are produced if the temperature becomes sufficiently high, but in reality their formation depends on the post-inflationary dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar. We analyze the dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar field in the early universe within models that provide an effective negative mass term at the origin, and show that the symmetry can remain broken so that topological defects are never formed. In particular, we demonstrate that nonthermally produced particles (such as the Standard Model Higgs) during preheating can generate such an effective negative mass term, allowing the scalar field to follow a time-dependent minimum even in renormalizable models with a quartic coupling. We also discuss the implications of this result for the Peccei-Quinn scalar in axion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond the Standard Model scenarios introduce additional scalar and fermion multiplets, which influence neutrino mass generation mechanisms and yield distinctive collider signatures. This work focuses on a particular scenario involving a fermion quintuplet and a scalar quadruplet. The study examines the production and decay of the scalar quadruplet components at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), emphasizing how their decay patterns, fermiophobic versus fermiophilic, depend on mass differences and Yukawa couplings with the fermion multiplets. This study provides an overview of possible signals at the LHC, along with a detailed collider analysis focused on final states containing at least four leptons and two jets, in which the masses of the scalars and fermions are reconstructed successfully. Standard Model backgrounds are also incorporated in the study, with multivariate techniques leveraged via Boosted Decision Trees. Results indicate discovery potential for scalar masses around 600-700 GeV and exclusion sensitivity extending beyond 1 TeV, highlighting the promising experimental signatures of the model and its role in probing new physics at colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the near-threshold exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons (quarkonia $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$) off the proton within the framework of generalized parton distribution (GPD) factorization. The gluon GPDs are computed using a spectator model in which the proton emits a gluon and the remaining constituents are treated as a single spectator particle. Model parameters are determined by fitting the gluon unpolarized and helicity collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) from global analyses. We compare our results with the latest near-threshold $J/\psi$ production data from the GlueX and $J/\psi$-007 experiments at Jefferson Laboratory, finding good agreement for both differential and total cross sections. Predictions are also provided for $\Upsilon$ photoproduction, which can be tested at future Electron-Ion Colliders.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes from a smoothed string fluid in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity sourced by a smoothed string fluid. Originally proposed to model regular black holes, this energy density profile is adapted here to sustain wormhole geometries by allowing for a radially varying equation of state. We obtain zero-tidal-force solutions that satisfy all traversability criteria and remain globally regular. The Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling $\alpha$ plays a central role in shaping the throat geometry. We identify a parameter region ($\alpha \geq 1$, $\varepsilon \leq 0.1$) in which the null energy condition is satisfied in the vicinity of the throat, representing a significant improvement over general relativistic counterparts. The interplay between the smoothing scale $a$ and the string density $\varepsilon$ ensures finite curvature invariants while reducing the violation of energy conditions. An analysis of the volume integral quantifier and the complexity factor further shows that strong EGB coupling simultaneously suppresses gravitational complexity and the total amount of exotic matter. These results establish a unified framework in which the same string fluid source can generate both regular black holes and stable traversable wormholes, depending on the strength of higher-curvature corrections.</description>

      <title>First Nucleon Gluon PDF from Large Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). We focus on the gluon operator which was demonstrated to have the best signal-to-noise in the previous attempt [1] in computing gluon PDFs using LaMET. We compute the corresponding Wilson coefficients needed for the hybrid-renormalized matrix elements and the matching kernel to convert the quasi-PDF to the lightcone one at the one-loop level. We demonstrate that with the proper Wilson coefficients in place, the counterterms for the renormalization are independent of the hadron and mass within statistical error. Using the resulting renormalization, we then compute the nucleon PDF using a HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$, $a \approx 0.12$ fm, with valence pion masses of 310 and 690 MeV and two gauge link smearing techniques. Despite the physics effects of the heavier than physical pion masses and gauge link smearing, this calculation provides excellent proof of principle and compares reasonably with selected global fit results.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy in effective field theory of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown to all orders of perturbation theory that in the effective field theory of general relativity the condition of vanishing of the vacuum energy leads to the same value of the cosmological constant, viewed as a parameter of the effective Lagrangian, as obtained by demanding the consistency of the effective field theory in Minkowski background. The resulting effective action is characterized by the cosmological constant term that vanishes exactly.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on Galileon dark energy with broken shift symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Verifying the failing supernova constraint on dark photons with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on the dark photon (DP) production in collapsing stars argue that the cooling effect induced by DPs can hinder supernova explosions and lead to a ``failing supernova" constraint on the photon-DP mixing parameter $\epsilon$. In order to verify the idea, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the DP production with the masses of 0.3 and 0.45\,MeV. We find that the shock revival does not happen until the end of the simulations when $\epsilon\gtrsim3\times10^{-9}$. The photon-DP mixing parameter above this value can be excluded by the failing supernova argument. Interestingly, our constraint roughly coincides with the one reported by the previous studies which adopted the post-processing framework. This result motivates one to investigate a wider parameter range of DPs with self-consistent simulations and evaluate uncertainties in the constraint.</description>

      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity Contribution to the Proton Spin from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, $\Delta G$. The calculation is done on ensembles with three different lattice spacings $a=\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\}$ fm. By employing distillation and momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^\mu$ using 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented by the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^\mu$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $\Delta G$ is found to be $\Delta G = 0.231(17)^{\mathrm{sta.}}(44)^{\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scale ${\mu}^2=10\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(9)\%$ of the proton spin.</description>
