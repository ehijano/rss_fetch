      <title>Metric Distortion for Tournament Voting and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the well-studied metric distortion problem in social choice, we have voters and candidates located in a shared metric space, and the objective is to design a voting rule that selects a candidate with minimal total distance to the voters. However, the voting rule has limited information about the distances in the metric, such as each voter's ordinal rankings of the candidates in order of distances. The central question is whether we can design rules that, for any election and underlying metric space, select a candidate whose total cost deviates from the optimal by only a small factor, referred to as the distortion.
  A long line of work resolved the optimal distortion of deterministic rules, and recent work resolved the optimal distortion of randomized (weighted) tournament rules, which only use the aggregate preferences between pairs of candidates. In both cases, simple rules achieve the optimal distortion of $3$. Can we achieve the best of both worlds: a deterministic tournament rule matching the lower bound of $3$? Prior to our work, the best rules have distortion $2 + \sqrt{5} \approx 4.2361$.
  In this work, we establish a lower bound of $3.1128$ on the distortion of any deterministic tournament rule, even when there are only 5 candidates, and improve the upper bound with a novel rule guaranteeing distortion $3.9312$. We then generalize tournament rules to the class of $k$-tournament rules which obtain the aggregate preferences between $k$-tuples of candidates. We show that there is a family of deterministic $k$-tournament rules that achieves distortion approaching $3$ as $k$ grows. Finally, we show that even with $k = 3$, a randomized $k$-tournament rule can achieve distortion less than $3$, which had been a longstanding barrier even for the larger class of ranked voting rules.</description>

      <title>Non-Obvious Manipulability in Additively Separable and Fractional Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the design of Non-Obviously Manipulable (NOM) mechanisms, mechanisms that bounded rational agents may fail to recognize as manipulable, for two relevant classes of succinctly representable Hedonic Games: Additively Separable and Fractional Hedonic Games. In these classes, agents have cardinal scores towards other agents, and their preferences over coalitions are determined by aggregating such scores. This aggregation results in a utility function for each agent, which enables the evaluation of outcomes via the utilitarian social welfare. We first prove that, when scores can be arbitrary, every optimal mechanism is NOM; moreover, when scores are limited in a continuous interval, there exists an optimal mechanism that is NOM. Given the hardness of computing optimal outcomes in these settings, we turn our attention to efficient and NOM mechanisms. To this aim, we first prove a characterization of NOM mechanisms that simplifies the class of mechanisms of interest. Then, we design a NOM mechanism returning approximations that asymptotically match the best-known approximation achievable in polynomial time. Finally, we focus on discrete scores, where the compatibility of NOM with optimality depends on the specific values. Therefore, we initiate a systematic analysis to identify which discrete values support this compatibility and which do not.</description>

      <title>Weakest Bidder Types and New Core-Selecting Combinatorial Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-selecting combinatorial auctions are popular auction designs that constrain prices to eliminate the incentive for any group of bidders -- with the seller -- to renegotiate for a better deal. They help overcome the low-revenue issues of classical combinatorial auctions. We introduce a new class of core-selecting combinatorial auctions that leverage bidder information available to the auction designer. We model such information through constraints on the joint type space of the bidders -- these are constraints on bidders' private valuations that are known to hold by the auction designer before bids are elicited. First, we show that type space information can overcome the well-known impossibility of incentive-compatible core-selecting combinatorial auctions. We present a revised and generalized version of that impossibility result that depends on how much information is conveyed by the type spaces. We then devise a new family of core-selecting combinatorial auctions and show that they minimize the sum of bidders' incentives to deviate from truthful bidding. We develop new constraint generation techniques -- and build upon existing quadratic programming techniques -- to compute core prices, and conduct experiments to evaluate the incentive, revenue, fairness, and computational merits of our new auctions. Our new core-selecting auctions directly improve upon existing designs that have been used in many high-stakes auctions around the world. We envision that they will be a useful addition to any auction designer's toolkit.</description>

      <title>Revenue-Optimal Efficient Mechanism Design with General Type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the revenue-optimal efficient (welfare-maximizing) mechanism in a general multidimensional mechanism design setting when type spaces -- that is, the underlying domains from which agents' values come from -- can capture arbitrarily complex informational constraints about the agents. Type spaces can encode information about agents representing, for example, machine learning predictions of agent behavior, institutional knowledge about feasible market outcomes (such as item substitutability or complementarity in auctions), and correlations between multiple agents. Prior work has only dealt with connected type spaces, which are not expressive enough to capture many natural kinds of constraints such as disjunctive constraints. We provide two characterizations of the optimal mechanism based on allocations and connected components; both make use of an underlying network flow structure to the mechanism design. Our results significantly generalize and improve the prior state of the art in revenue-optimal efficient mechanism design. They also considerably expand the scope of what forms of agent information can be expressed and used to improve revenue.</description>

      <title>Multiple Proposer Transaction Fee Mechanism Design: Robust Incentives Against Censorship and Bribery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Censorship resistance is one of the core value proposition of blockchains. A recurring design pattern aimed at providing censorship resistance is enabling multiple proposers to contribute inputs into block construction. Notably, Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) is proposed to be included in Ethereum. However, the current proposal relies on altruistic behavior, without a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM). This study aims to address this gap by exploring how multiple proposers should be rewarded to incentivize censorship resistance. The main contribution of this work is the identification of TFMs that ensure censorship resistance under bribery attacks, while also satisfying the incentive compatibility properties of EIP-1559. We provide a concrete payment mechanism for FOCIL, along with generalizable contributions to the literature by analyzing 1) incentive compatibility of TFMs in the presence of a bribing adversary, 2) TFMs in protocols with multiple phases of transaction inclusion, and 3) TFMs of protocols in which parties are uncertain about the behavior and the possible bribe of others.</description>

      <title>Online Resource Sharing: Better Robust Guarantees via Randomized Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair online resource allocation via non-monetary mechanisms, where multiple agents repeatedly share a resource without monetary transfers. Previous work has shown that every agent can guarantee $1/2$ of their ideal utility (the highest achievable utility given their fair share of resources) robustly, i.e., under arbitrary behavior by the other agents. While this $1/2$-robustness guarantee has now been established under very different mechanisms, including pseudo-markets and dynamic max-min allocation, improving on it has appeared difficult.
  In this work, we obtain the first significant improvement on the robustness of online resource sharing. In more detail, we consider the widely-studied repeated first-price auction with artificial currencies. Our main contribution is to show that a simple randomized bidding strategy can guarantee each agent a $2 - \sqrt 2 \approx 0.59$ fraction of her ideal utility, irrespective of others' bids. Specifically, our strategy requires each agent with fair share $\alpha$ to use a uniformly distributed bid whenever her value is in the top $\alpha$-quantile of her value distribution. Our work almost closes the gap to the known $1 - 1/e \approx 0.63$ hardness for robust resource sharing; we also show that any static (i.e., budget independent) bidding policy cannot guarantee more than a $0.6$-fraction of the ideal utility, showing our technique is almost tight.</description>

      <title>A Sequence-Form Characterization and Differentiable Path-Following Computation of Normal-Form Perfect Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence form, owing to its compact and holistic strategy representation, has demonstrated significant efficiency in computing normal-form perfect equilibria for two-player extensive-form games with perfect recall. Nevertheless, the examination of $n$-player games remains underexplored. To tackle this challenge, we present a sequence-form characterization of normal-form perfect equilibria for $n$-player extensive-form games, achieved through a class of perturbed games formulated in sequence form. Based on this characterization, we develop a differentiable path-following method for computing normal-form perfect equilibria and prove its convergence. This method involves constructing an artificial logarithmic-barrier game in sequence form, where an additional variable is incorporated to regulate the influence of logarithmic-barrier terms to the payoff functions, as well as the transition of the strategy space. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path defined by the artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan and converging to a normal-form perfect equilibrium of the original game as the additional variable approaches zero. Furthermore, we extend Harsanyi's linear and logarithmic tracing procedures to the sequence form and develop two alternative methods for computing normal-form perfect equilibria. Numerical experiments further substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.</description>

      <title>GUARD: Constructing Realistic Two-Player Matrix and Security Games for Benchmarking Game-Theoretic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game-theoretic algorithms are commonly benchmarked on recreational games, classical constructs from economic theory such as congestion and dispersion games, or entirely random game instances. While the past two decades have seen the rise of security games -- grounded in real-world scenarios like patrolling and infrastructure protection -- their practical evaluation has been hindered by limited access to the datasets used to generate them. In particular, although the structural components of these games (e.g., patrol paths derived from maps) can be replicated, the critical data defining target values -- central to utility modeling -- remain inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce a flexible framework that leverages open-access datasets to generate realistic matrix and security game instances. These include animal movement data for modeling anti-poaching scenarios and demographic and infrastructure data for infrastructure protection. Our framework allows users to customize utility functions and game parameters, while also offering a suite of preconfigured instances. We provide theoretical results highlighting the degeneracy and limitations of benchmarking on random games, and empirically compare our generated games against random baselines across a variety of standard algorithms for computing Nash and Stackelberg equilibria, including linear programming, incremental strategy generation, and self-play with no-regret learners.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Reputation Games and Applications to Proof-of-Reputation Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reputation systems play an essential role in the Internet era, as they enable people to decide whom to trust, by collecting and aggregating data about users' behavior. Recently, several works proposed the use of reputation for the design and scalability improvement of decentralized (blockchain) ledgers; however, such systems are prone to manipulation and to our knowledge no game-theoretic treatment exists that can support their economic robustness.
  In this work we put forth a new model for the design of what we call, {\em trustworthy reputation systems}. Concretely, we describe a class of games, which we term {\em trustworthy reputation games}, that enable a set of users to report a function of their beliefs about the trustworthiness of each server in a set -- i.e., their estimate of the probability that this server will behave according to its specified strategy -- in a way that satisfies the following properties:
  1. It is $(\epsilon$-)best response for any rational user in the game to play a prescribed (truthful) strategy according to their true belief.
  2. Assuming that the users' beliefs are not too far from the {\em true} trustworthiness of the servers, playing the above ($\epsilon-$)Nash equilibrium allows anyone who observes the users' strategies to estimate the relative trustworthiness of any two servers.
  Our utilities and decoding function build on a connection between the well known PageRank algorithm and the problem of trustworthiness discovery, which can be of independent interest. Finally, we show how the above games are motivated by and can be leveraged in proof-of-reputation (PoR) blockchains.</description>

      <title>Randomised Optimism via Competitive Co-Evolution for Matrix Games with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning in games is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with numerous applications~\citep{silver2016mastering,schrittwieser2020mastering}. This work investigates two-player zero-sum matrix games with an unknown payoff matrix and bandit feedback, where each player observes their actions and the corresponding noisy payoff. Prior studies have proposed algorithms for this setting~\citep{o2021matrix,maiti2023query,cai2024uncoupled}, with \citet{o2021matrix} demonstrating the effectiveness of deterministic optimism (e.g., \ucb) in achieving sublinear regret. However, the potential of randomised optimism in matrix games remains theoretically unexplored.
  We propose Competitive Co-evolutionary Bandit Learning (\coebl), a novel algorithm that integrates evolutionary algorithms (EAs) into the bandit framework to implement randomised optimism through EA variation operators. We prove that \coebl achieves sublinear regret, matching the performance of deterministic optimism-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical regret analysis of an evolutionary bandit learning algorithm in matrix games.
  Empirical evaluations on diverse matrix game benchmarks demonstrate that \coebl not only achieves sublinear regret but also consistently outperforms classical bandit algorithms, including \exptr~\citep{auer2002nonstochastic}, the variant \exptrni~\citep{cai2024uncoupled}, and \ucb~\citep{o2021matrix}. These results highlight the potential of evolutionary bandit learning, particularly the efficacy of randomised optimism via evolutionary algorithms in game-theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Truthful Language Models via Peer Elicitation Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities but remain prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. We introduce Peer Elicitation Games (PEG), a training-free, game-theoretic framework for aligning LLMs through a peer elicitation mechanism involving a generator and multiple discriminators instantiated from distinct base models. Discriminators interact in a peer evaluation setting, where rewards are computed using a determinant-based mutual information score that provably incentivizes truthful reporting without requiring ground-truth labels. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that each agent, via online learning, achieves sublinear regret in the sense their cumulative performance approaches that of the best fixed truthful strategy in hindsight. Moreover, we prove last-iterate convergence to a truthful Nash equilibrium, ensuring that the actual policies used by agents converge to stable and truthful behavior over time. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in factual accuracy. These results position PEG as a practical approach for eliciting truthful behavior from LLMs without supervision or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Fairshare Data Pricing via Data Valuation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training data is the backbone of large language models (LLMs), yet today's data markets often operate under exploitative pricing -- sourcing data from marginalized groups with little pay or recognition. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for LLM data markets, modeling the strategic interactions between buyers (LLM builders) and sellers (human annotators). We begin with theoretical and empirical analysis showing how exploitative pricing drives high-quality sellers out of the market, degrading data quality and long-term model performance. Then we introduce fairshare, a pricing mechanism grounded in data valuation that quantifies each data's contribution. It aligns incentives by sustaining seller participation and optimizing utility for both buyers and sellers. Theoretically, we show that fairshare yields mutually optimal outcomes: maximizing long-term buyer utility and seller profit while sustaining market participation. Empirically when training open-source LLMs on complex NLP tasks, including math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning, fairshare boosts seller earnings and ensures a stable supply of high-quality data, while improving buyers' performance-per-dollar and long-term welfare. Our findings offer a concrete path toward fair, transparent, and economically sustainable data markets for LLM. Our code will be open sourced.</description>

      <title>A General Upper Bound for the Runtime of a Coevolutionary Algorithm on Impartial Combinatorial Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their complex dynamics, combinatorial games are a key test case and application for algorithms that train game playing agents. Among those algorithms that train using self-play are coevolutionary algorithms (CoEAs). However, the successful application of CoEAs for game playing is difficult due to pathological behaviours such as cycling, an issue especially critical for games with intransitive payoff landscapes.
  Insight into how to design CoEAs to avoid such behaviours can be provided by runtime analysis. In this paper, we push the scope of runtime analysis for CoEAs to combinatorial games, proving a general upper bound for the number of simulated games needed for UMDA to discover (with high probability) an optimal strategy. This result applies to any impartial combinatorial game, and for many games the implied bound is polynomial or quasipolynomial as a function of the number of game positions. After proving the main result, we provide several applications to simple well-known games: Nim, Chomp, Silver Dollar, and Turning Turtles. As the first runtime analysis for CoEAs on combinatorial games, this result is a critical step towards a comprehensive theoretical framework for coevolution.</description>

      <title>Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.</description>

Abstract: Trust and reciprocation of it form the foundation of economic, social and other interactions. While the Trust Game is widely used to study these concepts for interactions between two players, often alternating different roles (i.e., investor and trustee), its extensions to multi-player scenarios have been restricted to instances where players assume only one role. We propose a symmetric N-player Trust Game, in which players alternate between two roles, and the payoff of the player is defined as the average across their two roles and drives the evolutionary game dynamics. We find that prosocial strategies are harder to evolve with the present symmetric N-player Trust Game than with the Public Goods Game, which is well studied. In particular, trust fails to evolve regardless of payoff function nonlinearity in well-mixed populations in the case of the symmetric N-player trust game. In structured populations, nonlinear payoffs can have strong impacts on the evolution of trust. The same nonlinearity can yield substantially different outcomes, depending on the nature of the underlying network. Our results highlight the importance of considering both payoff structures and network topologies in understanding the emergence and maintenance of prosocial behaviours.</description>
