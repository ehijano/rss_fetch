      <title>In Dialogue with Intelligence: Rethinking Large Language Models as Collective Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically analysed through architectural, behavioural, or training-data lenses. This article offers a theoretical and experiential re-framing: LLMs as dynamic instantiations of Collective human Knowledge (CK), where intelligence is evoked through dialogue rather than stored statically. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience and AI, and grounded in sustained interaction with ChatGPT-4, I examine emergent dialogue patterns, the implications of fine-tuning, and the notion of co-augmentation: mutual enhancement between human and machine cognition. This perspective offers a new lens for understanding interaction, representation, and agency in contemporary AI systems.</description>

      <title>MAC-Gaze: Motion-Aware Continual Calibration for Mobile Gaze Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking faces a fundamental challenge: maintaining accuracy as users naturally change their postures and device orientations. Traditional calibration approaches, like one-off, fail to adapt to these dynamic conditions, leading to degraded performance over time. We present MAC-Gaze, a Motion-Aware continual Calibration approach that leverages smartphone Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and continual learning techniques to automatically detect changes in user motion states and update the gaze tracking model accordingly. Our system integrates a pre-trained visual gaze estimator and an IMU-based activity recognition model with a clustering-based hybrid decision-making mechanism that triggers recalibration when motion patterns deviate significantly from previously encountered states. To enable accumulative learning of new motion conditions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, we employ replay-based continual learning, allowing the model to maintain performance across previously encountered motion conditions. We evaluate our system through extensive experiments on the publicly available RGBDGaze dataset and our own 10-hour multimodal MotionGaze dataset (481K+ images, 800K+ IMU readings), encompassing a wide range of postures under various motion conditions including sitting, standing, lying, and walking. Results demonstrate that our method reduces gaze estimation error by 19.9% on RGBDGaze (from 1.73 cm to 1.41 cm) and by 31.7% on MotionGaze (from 2.81 cm to 1.92 cm) compared to traditional calibration approaches. Our framework provides a robust solution for maintaining gaze estimation accuracy in mobile scenarios.</description>

      <title>Orca: Browsing at Scale Through User-Driven and AI-Facilitated Orchestration Across Malleable Webpages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web-based activities are fundamentally distributed across webpages. However, conventional browsers with stacks of tabs fail to support operating and synthesizing large volumes of information across pages. While recent AI systems enable fully automated web browsing and information synthesis, they often diminish user agency and hinder contextual understanding. Therefore, we explore how AI could instead augment users' interactions with content across webpages and mitigate cognitive and manual efforts. Through literature on information tasks and web browsing challenges, and an iterative design process, we present a rich set of novel interactions with our prototype web browser, Orca. Leveraging AI, Orca supports user-driven exploration, operation, organization, and synthesis of web content at scale. To enable browsing at scale, webpages are treated as malleable materials that humans and AI can collaboratively manipulate and compose into a malleable, dynamic, and browser-level workspace. Our evaluation revealed an increased "appetite" for information foraging, enhanced user control, and more flexibility in sensemaking across a broader information landscape on the web.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Depression Recognition in Spoken Language Integrating Psychological Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original paper.

      <title>HiLDe: Intentional Code Generation via Human-in-the-Loop Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers' capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Politics of Decentralized Social Media Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calls to decentralize feed-based social media have been driven by concerns about the concentrated power of centralized platforms and their societal impact. In response, numerous decentralized social media protocols have emerged, each interpreting "decentralization" in different ways. We analyze four such protocols -- ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, and Farcaster -- to develop a novel conceptual framework for understanding how protocols operationalize decentralization. Drawing from protocol documentation, media coverage, and first-hand interviews with protocol developers and experts, we contextualize each protocol's approach within their respective socio-technical goals. Our framework highlights how control over key components is distributed differently across each protocol, shaping who holds power over what kinds of decisions. How components are arranged in relation to one another further impacts how component owners might offset each other's power in shaping social media. We argue that examining protocols as artifacts reveals how values shape infrastructure and power dynamics -- and that with a holistic framework as a guide, we can more effectively evaluate and design decentralized platforms aligned with the social and political futures we envision.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Driver Perceptions of Integrated Safety Monitoring Systems for Alcohol Impairment and Distraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of accidents caused by alcohol-impaired driving has prompted the development of integrated safety systems in vehicles to monitor driver behavior and prevent crashes. This paper explores how drivers perceive these systems, focusing on their comfort, trust, privacy concerns, and willingness to adopt the technology. Through a survey of 115 U.S. participants, the study reveals a preference for non-intrusive systems, such as those monitoring eye movements, over more restrictive technologies like alcohol detection devices. Privacy emerged as a major concern, with many participants preferring local data processing and anonymity. Trust in these systems was crucial for acceptance, as drivers are more likely to adapt their behavior when they believe the system is accurate and reliable. To encourage adoption, it is important to address concerns about privacy and balance the benefits of safety with personal freedom. By improving transparency, ensuring reliability, and increasing public awareness, these systems could play a significant role in reducing road accidents and improving safety.</description>

      <title>Free Lunch for User Experience: Crowdsourcing Agents for Scalable User Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the potential of anthropomorphized language agents to generate budget-friendly, moderate-fidelity, yet sufficiently insightful user experiences at scale, supporting fast, early-stage prototyping. We explore this through the case of prototyping Large Language Model-driven non-player characters (NPCs). We present Agentic H-CI, a framework that mirrors traditional user research processes-surveying, screening, experiencing, and collecting feedback and insights-with simulated agents. Using this approach, we easily construct a team of 240 player agents with a balanced range of player types and personality traits, at extremely low cost (\$0.28/player) and minimal time commitment (6.9 minutes/player). Content analysis shows that agent-based players behave in ways aligned with their simulated backgrounds, achieving 82.5\% alignment with designated profiles. From their interactions, we distill 11 user insights and 6 design implications to guide further development. To evaluate practical value, we conduct parallel user studies with human participants recruited locally and via crowdsourcing. Ratings from three professional game developers show that the agentic player team offers a Pareto-optimal and well-balanced trade-off across fidelity, cost, time efficiency, and insight helpfulness.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Assistive Technologies for People with Cerebral Visual Impairment: A Review and Focus Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, considerable research has investigated Vision-Based Assistive Technologies (VBAT) to support people with vision impairments to understand and interact with their immediate environment using machine learning, computer vision, image enhancement, and/or augmented/virtual reality. However, this has almost totally overlooked a growing demographic: people with Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI). Unlike ocular vision impairments, CVI arises from damage to the brain's visual processing centres. Through a scoping review, this paper reveals a significant research gap in addressing the needs of this demographic. Three focus studies involving 7 participants with CVI explored the challenges, current strategies, and opportunities for VBAT. We also discussed the assistive technology needs of people with CVI compared with ocular low vision. Our findings highlight the opportunity for the Human-Computer Interaction and Assistive Technologies research community to explore and address this underrepresented domain, thereby enhancing the quality of life for people with CVI.</description>

      <title>iTrace : Interactive Tracing of Cross-View Data Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring data relations across multiple views has been a common task in many domains such as bioinformatics, cybersecurity, and healthcare. To support this, various techniques (e.g., visual links and brushing and linking) are used to show related visual elements across views via lines and highlights. However, understanding the relations using these techniques, when many related elements are scattered, can be difficult due to spatial distance and complexity. To address this, we present iTrace, an interactive visualization technique to effectively trace cross-view data relationships. iTrace leverages the concept of interactive focus transitions, which allows users to see and directly manipulate their focus as they navigate between views. By directing the user's attention through smooth transitions between related elements, iTrace makes it easier to follow data relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iTrace with a user study, and we conclude with a discussion of how iTrace can be broadly used to enhance data exploration in various types of visualizations.</description>

      <title>Eye-tracking-Driven Shared Control for Robotic Arms:Wizard of Oz Studies to Assess Design Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in eye-tracking control for assistive robotic arms provide intuitive interaction opportunities for people with physical disabilities. Shared control has gained interest in recent years by improving user satisfaction through partial automation of robot control. We present an eye-tracking-guided shared control design based on insights from state-of-the-art literature. A Wizard of Oz setup was used in which automation was simulated by an experimenter to evaluate the concept without requiring full implementation. This approach allowed for rapid exploration of user needs and expectations to inform future iterations. Two studies were conducted to assess user experience, identify design challenges, and find improvements to ensure usability and accessibility. The first study involved people with disabilities by providing a survey, and the second study used the Wizard of Oz design in person to gain technical insights, leading to a comprehensive picture of findings.</description>

      <title>Investigating A Geometrical Solution to the Vergence-Accommodation Conflict for Targeted Movements in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While virtual reality (VR) holds significant potential to revolutionize digital user interaction, how visual information is presented through VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) differs from naturalistic viewing and interactions in physical environments, leading to performance decrements. One critical challenge in VR development is the vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC), which arises due to the intrinsic constraints of approximating the natural viewing geometry through digital displays. Although various hardware and software solutions have been proposed to address VAC, no commercially viable option has been universally adopted by manufacturers. This paper presents and evaluates a software solution grounded in a vision-based geometrical model of VAC that mediates VAC's impact on movement in VR. This model predicts the impact of VAC as a constant offset to the vergence angle, distorting the binocular viewing geometry that results in movement undershooting. In Experiment 1, a 3D pointing task validated the model's predictions and demonstrated that VAC primarily affects online movements involving real-time visual feedback. Experiment 2 implemented a shader program to rectify the effect of VAC, improving movement accuracy by approximately 30%. Overall, this work presented a practical approach to reducing the impact of VAC on HMD-based manual interactions, enhancing the user experience in virtual environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entrepreneurship education equips students to transform innovative ideas into actionable entrepreneurship plans, yet traditional approaches often struggle to provide the personalized guidance and practical alignment needed for success. Focusing on the business plan as a key learning tool and evaluation method, this study investigates the design needs for an AI-empowered scaffold system to address these challenges. Based on qualitative insights from educators and students, the findings highlight three critical dimensions for system design: mastery of business plan development, alignment with entrepreneurial learning goals, and integration of adaptive system features. These findings underscore the transformative potential of AI in bridging gaps in entrepreneurship education while emphasizing the enduring value of human mentorship and experiential learning.</description>

      <title>Self-driving technologies need the help of the public: A narrative review of the evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If public trust is lot in a new technology early in its life cycle it can take much more time for the benefits of that technology to be realised. Eventually tens-of-millions of people will collectively have the power to determine self-driving technology success of failure driven by their perception of risk, data handling, safety, governance, accountability, benefits to their life and more. This paper reviews the evidence on safety critical technology covering trust, engagement, and acceptance. The paper takes a narrative review approach concluding with a scalable model for self-driving technology education and engagement. The paper find that if a mismatch between the publics perception and expectations about self driving systems emerge it can lead to misuse, disuse, or abuse of the system. Furthermore we find from the evidence that industrial experts often misunderstand what matters to the public, users, and stakeholders. However we find that engagement programmes that develop approaches to defining the right information at the right time, in the right format orientated around what matters to the public creates the potential for ever more sophisticated conversations, greater trust, and moving the public into a progressive more active role of critique and advocacy. This work has been undertaken as part of the Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE) United Kingdom programme.</description>

      <title>Human Empathy as Encoder: AI-Assisted Depression Assessment in Special Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students' true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration, this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy</description>

      <title>Errors in Stereo Geometry Induce Distance Misperception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMDs) render and present binocular images to create an egocentric, 3D percept to the HMD user. Within this render and presentation pipeline there are potential rendering camera and viewing position errors that can induce deviations in the depth and distance that a user perceives compared to the underlying intended geometry. For example, rendering errors can arise when HMD render cameras are incorrectly positioned relative to the assumed centers of projections of the HMD displays and viewing errors can arise when users view stereo geometry from the incorrect location in the HMD eyebox. In this work we present a geometric framework that predicts errors in distance perception arising from inaccurate HMD perspective geometry and build an HMD platform to reliably simulate render and viewing error in a Quest 3 HMD with eye tracking to experimentally test these predictions. We present a series of five experiments to explore the efficacy of this geometric framework and show that errors in perspective geometry can induce both under- and over-estimations in perceived distance. We further demonstrate how real-time visual feedback can be used to dynamically recalibrate visuomotor mapping so that an accurate reach distance is achieved even if the perceived visual distance is negatively impacted by geometric error.</description>

      <title>DTBIA: An Immersive Visual Analytics System for Brain-Inspired Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Digital Twin Brain (DTB) is an advanced artificial intelligence framework that integrates spiking neurons to simulate complex cognitive functions and collaborative behaviors. For domain experts, visualizing the DTB's simulation outcomes is essential to understanding complex cognitive activities. However, this task poses significant challenges due to DTB data's inherent characteristics, including its high-dimensionality, temporal dynamics, and spatial complexity. To address these challenges, we developed DTBIA, an Immersive Visual Analytics System for Brain-Inspired Research. In collaboration with domain experts, we identified key requirements for effectively visualizing spatiotemporal and topological patterns at multiple levels of detail. DTBIA incorporates a hierarchical workflow - ranging from brain regions to voxels and slice sections - along with immersive navigation and a 3D edge bundling algorithm to enhance clarity and provide deeper insights into both functional (BOLD) and structural (DTI) brain data. The utility and effectiveness of DTBIA are validated through two case studies involving with brain research experts. The results underscore the system's role in enhancing the comprehension of complex neural behaviors and interactions.</description>

      <title>First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons &amp; Dragons Gameplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons &amp; Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.</description>

      <title>Strategic Reflectivism In Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism, transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about the value of intuition and reflection.</description>

      <title>A Constructed Response: Designing and Choreographing Robot Arm Movements in Collaborative Dance Improvisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dancers often prototype movements themselves or with each other during improvisation and choreography. How are these interactions altered when physically manipulable technologies are introduced into the creative process? To understand how dancers design and improvise movements while working with instruments capable of non-humanoid movements, we engaged dancers in workshops to co-create movements with a robot arm in one-human-to-one-robot and three-human-to-one-robot settings. We found that dancers produced more fluid movements in one-to-one scenarios, experiencing a stronger sense of connection and presence with the robot as a co-dancer. In three-to-one scenarios, the dancers divided their attention between the human dancers and the robot, resulting in increased perceived use of space and more stop-and-go movements, perceiving the robot as part of the stage background. This work highlights how technologies can drive creativity in movement artists adapting to new ways of working with physical instruments, contributing design insights supporting artistic collaborations with non-humanoid agents.</description>

      <title>An open-source Modular Online Psychophysics Platform (MOPP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there is a growing need and opportunity to use online platforms for psychophysics research. Online experiments make it possible to evaluate large and diverse populations remotely and quickly, complementing laboratory-based research. However, developing and running online psychophysics experiments poses several challenges: i) a high barrier-to-entry for researchers who often need to learn complex code-based platforms, ii) an uncontrolled experimental environment, and iii) questionable credibility of the participants. Here, we introduce an open-source Modular Online Psychophysics Platform (MOPP) to address these challenges. Through the simple web-based interface of MOPP, researchers can build modular experiments, share them with others, and copy or modify tasks from each others environments. MOPP provides built-in features to calibrate for viewing distance and to measure visual acuity. It also includes email-based and IP-based authentication, and reCAPTCHA verification. We developed five example psychophysics tasks, that come preloaded in the environment, and ran a pilot experiment which was hosted on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud. Pilot data collected for these tasks yielded similar results to those reported in laboratory settings. MOPP can thus help researchers collect large psychophysics datasets online, with reduced turnaround time, and in a standardized manner.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Word-level Quality Estimation for Machine Translation Through the Lens of Annotators (Dis)agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses, including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14 metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.</description>

      <title>Towards LLM-Empowered Fine-Grained Speech Descriptors for Explainable Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel end-to-end LLM-empowered explainable speech emotion recognition (SER) approach. Fine-grained speech emotion descriptor (SED) features, e.g., pitch, tone and emphasis, are disentangled from HuBERT SSL representations via alternating LLM fine-tuning to joint SER-SED prediction and ASR tasks. VAE compressed HuBERT features derived via Information Bottleneck (IB) are used to adjust feature granularity. Experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms comparable LLaMA-based SER baselines, including those using either (a) alternating multi-task fine-tuning alone or (b) feature disentanglement only. Statistically significant increase of SER unweighted accuracy by up to 4.0% and 3.7% absolute (5.4% and 6.6% relative) are obtained. More importantly, emotion descriptors offer further explainability for SER.</description>

      <title>To Measure What Isn't There -- Visual Exploration of Missingness Structures Using Quality Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes a set of quality metrics for identification and visual analysis of structured missingness in high-dimensional data. Missing values in data are a frequent challenge in most data generating domains and may cause a range of analysis issues. Structural missingness in data may indicate issues in data collection and pre-processing, but may also highlight important data characteristics. While research into statistical methods for dealing with missing data are mainly focusing on replacing missing values with plausible estimated values, visualization has great potential to support a more in-depth understanding of missingness structures in data. Nonetheless, while the interest in missing data visualization has increased in the last decade, it is still a relatively overlooked research topic with a comparably small number of publications, few of which address scalability issues. Efficient visual analysis approaches are needed to enable exploration of missingness structures in large and high-dimensional data, and to support informed decision-making in context of potential data quality issues. This paper suggests a set of quality metrics for identification of patterns of interest for understanding of structural missingness in data. These quality metrics can be used as guidance in visual analysis, as demonstrated through a use case exploring structural missingness in data from a real-life walking monitoring study. All supplemental materials for this paper are available at https://doi.org/10.25405/data.ncl.c.7741829.</description>

      <title>The CASE Framework -- A New Architecture for Participatory Research and Digital Health Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the CASE framework, an open-source platform for adaptive, context-aware participatory research, and pandemic preparedness. CASE implements an event-driven architecture that enables dynamic survey workflows, allowing real-time adaptation based on participant responses, external data, temporal conditions, and evolving user states. The framework supports a broad range of research needs, from simple one-time questionnaires to complex longitudinal studies with advanced conditional logic. Built on over a decade of practical experience, CASE underwent a major architectural rework in 2024, transitioning from a microservice-based design to a streamlined monolithic architecture. This evolution significantly improved maintainability, flexibility, and accessibility to deployment, particularly for institutions with limited technical capacity. CASE has been successfully deployed across diverse domains, powering national disease surveillance platforms, supporting post-COVID cohort studies, and enabling real-time sentiment analysis during political events. These applications, involving tens of thousands of participants, demonstrate the framework's scalability, versatility, and practical value. This paper describes the foundations of CASE, details its architectural evolution, and presents lessons learned from real-world deployments. We establish CASE as a mature and reusable research infrastructure that balances sophisticated functionality with practical implementation, addressing the critical global need for sustainable and institutionally controlled data collection systems.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Guardrails for Open-World Decision Making in Autonomous Drone Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications. While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design, simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in search-and-rescue missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement and democratization of generative AI models have sparked significant debate over safety, ethical risks, and dual-use concerns, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. While anecdotally known, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding generative AI's association with malicious internet-related activities and cybercrime by examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in cybercrime. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about AI governance by balancing control and fostering innovation, underscoring the need for strategies to guide policymakers, inform AI developers and cybersecurity professionals, and educate the public to maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its risks.</description>

      <title>What Should Be Considered to Support well-being with AI: Considerations Based on Responsible Research and Innovation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To achieve people's well-being with AI systems, we should enable each user to be guided to a healthier lifestyle in a way that is appropriate for her or him. However, there is a dilemma between general well-being as defined in academic and medical discussions and the autonomy users should have when deciding how to promote their well-being. In this position paper, we discuss the difficulty for AI application developers to fully consider in the design phase what might happen to the user, taking an example of a running application (app). We sort out the required factors to enable AI apps that support well-being to address the dilemma between unilaterally defined well-being and human autonomy based on the four dimensions required for responsible innovation: inclusion, anticipation, reflexivity, and responsiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents have drawn increasing attention mostly on their ability to perceive environments, understand tasks, and autonomously achieve goals. To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents which are capable of completing tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing GUI-related datasets, e.g., Rico, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets. Additionally, we finetune a baseline model SPHINX Agent and illustrate the effectiveness of AMEX.The project is available at https://yxchai.com/AMEX/.</description>

      <title>Argumentative Experience: Reducing Confirmation Bias on Controversial Issues through LLM-Generated Multi-Persona Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling designers to give life to exciting new user experiences for information access. In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased?
  Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking.</description>

      <title>From Lived Experience to Insight: Unpacking the Psychological Risks of Using AI Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gains in popularity of AI conversational agents have led to their increased use for improving productivity and supporting well-being. While previous research has aimed to understand the risks associated with interactions with AI conversational agents, these studies often fall short in capturing the lived experiences of individuals. Additionally, psychological risks have often been presented as a sub-category within broader AI-related risks in past taxonomy works, leading to under-representation of the impact of psychological risks of AI use. To address these challenges, our work presents a novel risk taxonomy focusing on psychological risks of using AI gathered through the lived experiences of individuals. We employed a mixed-method approach, involving a comprehensive survey with 283 people with lived mental health experience and workshops involving experts with lived experience to develop a psychological risk taxonomy. Our taxonomy features 19 AI behaviors, 21 negative psychological impacts, and 15 contexts related to individuals. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-path vignette-based framework for understanding the complex interplay between AI behaviors, psychological impacts, and individual user contexts. Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the workshop sessions, we present design recommendations for developing safer and more robust AI agents. Our work offers an in-depth understanding of the psychological risks associated with AI conversational agents and provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and developers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Motion on 2D Gaze Estimation in Real-World Mobile Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking involves inferring a user's gaze point or direction on a mobile device's screen from facial images captured by the device's front camera. While this technology inspires an increasing number of gaze-interaction applications, achieving consistent accuracy remains challenging due to dynamic user-device spatial relationships and varied motion conditions inherent in mobile contexts. This paper provides empirical evidence on how user mobility and behaviour affect mobile gaze tracking accuracy. We conduct two user studies collecting behaviour and gaze data under various motion conditions - from lying to maze navigation - and during different interaction tasks. Quantitative analysis has revealed behavioural regularities among daily tasks and identified head distance, head pose, and device orientation as key factors affecting accuracy, with errors increasing by up to 48.91% in dynamic conditions compared to static ones. These findings highlight the need for more robust, adaptive eye-tracking systems that account for head movements and device deflection to maintain accuracy across diverse mobile contexts.</description>

      <title>Trust-Enabled Privacy: Social Media Designs to Support Adolescent User Boundary Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adolescents heavily rely on social media to build and maintain close relationships, yet current platform designs often make self-disclosure feel risky or uncomfortable. Through a three-part study involving 19 teens aged 13-18, we identify key barriers to meaningful self-disclosure on social media. Our findings reveal that while these adolescents seek casual, frequent sharing to strengthen relationships, existing platform norms often discourage such interactions. Based on our co-design interview findings, we propose platform design ideas to foster a more dynamic and nuanced privacy experience for teen social media users. We then introduce \textbf{\textit{trust-enabled privacy}} as a framework that recognizes trust -- whether building or eroding -- as central to boundary regulation, and foregrounds the role of platform design in shaping the very norms and interaction patterns that influence how trust unfolds. When trust is supported, boundary regulation becomes more adaptive and empowering; when it erodes, users resort to self-censorship or disengagement. This work provides empirical insights and actionable guidelines for designing social media spaces where teens feel empowered to engage in meaningful relationship-building processes.</description>

      <title>Gaze-Enhanced Multimodal Turn-Taking Prediction in Triadic Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turn-taking prediction is crucial for seamless interactions. This study introduces a novel, lightweight framework for accurate turn-taking prediction in triadic conversations without relying on computationally intensive methods. Unlike prior approaches that either disregard gaze or treat it as a passive signal, our model integrates gaze with speaker localization, structuring it within a spatial constraint to transform it into a reliable predictive cue. Leveraging egocentric behavioral cues, our experiments demonstrate that incorporating gaze data from a single-user significantly improves prediction performance, while gaze data from multiple-users further enhances it by capturing richer conversational dynamics. This study presents a lightweight and privacy-conscious approach to support adaptive, directional sound control, enhancing speech intelligibility in noisy environments, particularly for hearing assistance in smart glasses.</description>

      <title>What Needs Attention? Prioritizing Drivers of Developers' Trust and Adoption of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (genAI) tools are advertised as productivity aids. Yet, issues related to miscalibrated trust and usage friction continue to hinder their adoption. Additionally, AI can be exclusionary, failing to support diverse users adequately, further exacerbating these concerns. One such aspect of diversity is cognitive diversity -- variations in users' cognitive styles -- that leads to divergence in interaction styles. When an individual's cognitive styles are unsupported, it creates additional barriers to technology adoption. Thus, to design tools that developers trust, we must first understand what factors affect their trust and intentions to use these tools in practice?
  We developed a theoretical model of factors influencing trust and adoption intentions towards genAI through a large-scale survey with developers (N=238) at GitHub and Microsoft. Using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we found that genAI's system/output quality, functional value, and goal maintenance significantly influence developers' trust, which along with their cognitive styles, affects their intentions to use these tools in work. An Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) identified factors that, despite their strong influence, underperform, revealing specific genAI aspects that need design prioritization. We bolster these findings by qualitatively analyzing developers' perceived challenges and risks of genAI usage to uncover why these gaps persist in development contexts. For genAI to indeed be a true productivity aid rather than a disguised productivity sink, it must align with developers' goals, maintain contextual transparency, reduce cognitive burden, and provide equitable interaction support. We provide practical suggestions to guide future genAI tool design for effective, trustworthy, and inclusive human-genAI interactions.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Human Evaluation of Large Language Models via Maximum Discrepancy Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is impeded by two key challenges: objective metrics often fail to reflect human perception of natural language, and exhaustive human labeling is prohibitively expensive. Here, we propose a sample-efficient human evaluation method for LLMs based on the principle of MAximum Discrepancy (MAD) Competition. Our method automatically and adaptively selects a compact set of input instructions that maximize semantic discrepancy between pairs of LLM responses. Human evaluators then perform three-alternative forced choices on these paired responses, which are aggregated into a global ranking using Elo rating. We apply our approach to compare eight widely used LLMs across four tasks: scientific knowledge understanding, mathematical reasoning, creative and functional writing, and code generation and explanation. Experimental results show that our sample-efficient evaluation method recovers "gold-standard" model rankings with a handful of MAD-selected instructions, reveals respective strengths and weaknesses of each LLM, and offers nuanced insights to guide future LLM development.

      <title>Robustness-enhanced Myoelectric Control with GAN-based Open-set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used in human motion recognition and medical rehabilitation, yet their variability and susceptibility to noise significantly limit the reliability of myoelectric control systems. Existing recognition algorithms often fail to handle unfamiliar actions effectively, leading to system instability and errors. This paper proposes a novel framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems by enabling open-set recognition. The method incorporates a GAN-based discriminator to identify and reject unknown actions, maintaining system stability by preventing misclassifications. Experimental evaluations on publicly available and self-collected datasets demonstrate a recognition accuracy of 97.6\% for known actions and a 23.6\% improvement in Active Error Rate (AER) after rejecting unknown actions. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and suitable for deployment on edge devices, making it practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Mental Health: Exploring College Students' Well-being through Smartphone Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global mental health crisis is a pressing concern, with college students particularly vulnerable to rising mental health disorders. The widespread use of smartphones among young adults, while offering numerous benefits, has also been linked to negative outcomes such as addiction and regret, significantly impacting well-being. Leveraging the longest longitudinal dataset collected over four college years through passive mobile sensing, this study is the first to examine the relationship between students' smartphone unlocking behaviors and their mental health at scale in real-world settings. We provide the first evidence demonstrating the predictability of phone unlocking behaviors for mental health outcomes based on a large dataset, highlighting the potential of these novel features for future predictive models. Our findings reveal important variations in smartphone usage across genders and locations, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between digital behaviors and mental health. We highlight future research directions aimed at mitigating adverse effects and promoting digital well-being in this population.</description>

      <title>FlexDuo: A Pluggable System for Enabling Full-Duplex Capabilities in Speech Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Dialogue Systems (Full-Duplex SDS) have significantly enhanced the naturalness of human-machine interaction by enabling real-time bidirectional communication. However, existing approaches face challenges such as difficulties in independent module optimization and contextual noise interference due to highly coupled architectural designs and oversimplified binary state modeling. This paper proposes FlexDuo, a flexible full-duplex control module that decouples duplex control from spoken dialogue systems through a plug-and-play architectural design. Furthermore, inspired by human information-filtering mechanisms in conversations, we introduce an explicit Idle state. On one hand, the Idle state filters redundant noise and irrelevant audio to enhance dialogue quality. On the other hand, it establishes a semantic integrity-based buffering mechanism, reducing the risk of mutual interruptions while ensuring accurate response transitions. Experimental results on the Fisher corpus demonstrate that FlexDuo reduces the false interruption rate by 24.9% and improves response accuracy by 7.6% compared to integrated full-duplex dialogue system baselines. It also outperforms voice activity detection (VAD) controlled baseline systems in both Chinese and English dialogue quality. The proposed modular architecture and state-based dialogue model provide a novel technical pathway for building flexible and efficient duplex dialogue systems.</description>

      <title>SOTOPIA-$\Omega$: Dynamic Strategy Injection Learning and Social Instruction Following Evaluation for Social Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the abundance of prior social strategies possessed by humans, there remains a paucity of research dedicated to their transfer and integration into social agents. Our proposed SOTOPIA-$\Omega$ framework aims to address and bridge this gap, with a particular focus on enhancing the social capabilities of language agents. This framework dynamically injects multi-step reasoning strategies inspired by negotiation theory and two simple direct strategies into expert agents, thereby automating the construction of a high-quality social dialogue training corpus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Social Instruction Following (S-IF) and propose two new S-IF evaluation metrics that complement social capability. We demonstrate that several 7B models trained on high-quality corpus not only significantly surpass the expert agent (GPT-4) in achieving social goals but also enhance S-IF performance. Analysis and variant experiments validate the advantages of dynamic construction, which can especially break the agent's prolonged deadlock.</description>
