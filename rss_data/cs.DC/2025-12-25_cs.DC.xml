      <title>RHAPSODY: Execution of Hybrid AI-HPC Workflows at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid AI-HPC workflows combine large-scale simulation, training, high-throughput inference, and tightly coupled, agent-driven control within a single execution campaign. These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>Stochastic well-structured transition systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.</description>

      <title>Diving into 3D Parallelism with Heterogeneous Spot Instance GPUs: Design and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.</description>

      <title>Deadline-Aware Online Scheduling for LLM Fine-Tuning with Spot Market Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.</description>

      <title>Mesh-Attention: A New Communication-Efficient Distributed Attention with Improved Data Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.</description>

      <title>ESCHER: Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation with Application to Triad Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.</description>

      <title>PHOTON: Hierarchical Autoregressive Modeling for Lightspeed and Memory-Efficient Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.</description>

      <title>SoK: Speedy Secure Finality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Ethereum has successfully achieved dynamic availability together with safety, a fundamental delay remains between transaction execution and immutable finality. In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.
  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.</description>

      <title>AirGS: Real-Time 4D Gaussian Streaming for Free-Viewpoint Video Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.</description>

      <title>zkFL-Health: Blockchain-Enabled Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning for Medical AI Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>Declarative distributed broadcast using three-valued modal logic and semitopologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to formally specify distributed algorithms as declarative axiomatic theories in a modal logic. We exhibit the method on a simple voting protocol, a simple broadcast protocol, and a simple agreement protocol. The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.
  A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations.</description>

      <title>On the Inherent Anonymity of Gossiping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the source of a gossip is a critical issue, related to identifying patient zero in an epidemic, or the origin of a rumor in a social network. Although it is widely acknowledged that random and local gossip communications make source identification difficult, there exists no general quantification of the level of anonymity provided to the source. This paper presents a principled method based on $\varepsilon$-differential privacy to analyze the inherent source anonymity of gossiping for a large class of graphs. First, we quantify the fundamental limit of source anonymity any gossip protocol can guarantee in an arbitrary communication graph. In particular, our result indicates that when the graph has poor connectivity, no gossip protocol can guarantee any meaningful level of differential privacy. This prompted us to further analyze graphs with controlled connectivity. We prove on these graphs that a large class of gossip protocols, namely cobra walks, offers tangible differential privacy guarantees to the source. In doing so, we introduce an original proof technique based on the reduction of a gossip protocol to what we call a random walk with probabilistic die out. This proof technique is of independent interest to the gossip community and readily extends to other protocols inherited from the security community, such as the Dandelion protocol. Interestingly, our tight analysis precisely captures the trade-off between dissemination time of a gossip protocol and its source anonymity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Frequent Checkpointing via Low-Cost Differential for Distributed Training Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures, so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.
  We propose \sysname, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints to reduce cost. Furthermore, \sysname incorporates a batched gradient write optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to maximize performance. To enhance \sysname under non-compression scenarios, we further propose \sysnameplus, which incorporates a layer-wise-reuse snapshotting strategy, along with an incremental-merging persistence strategy. Experiments on various workloads show that \sysname and \sysnameplus can reduce the training time by up to 89.2\% and 81.2\% with checkpointing frequency up to per iteration.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <title>HYLU: Hybrid Parallel Sparse LU Factorization</title>

Abstract: This article introduces HYLU, a hybrid parallel LU factorization-based general-purpose solver designed for efficiently solving sparse linear systems (Ax=b) on multi-core shared-memory architectures. The key technical feature of HYLU is the integration of hybrid numerical kernels so that it can adapt to various sparsity patterns of coefficient matrices. Tests on 34 sparse matrices from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection reveal that HYLU outperforms Intel MKL PARDISO in the numerical factorization phase by geometric means of 2.04X (for one-time solving) and 2.58X (for repeated solving). HYLU can be downloaded from https://github.com/chenxm1986/hylu.</description>
