      <title>Competition and Investment Model of Wealth Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining empirically observed wealth and income distributions, featuring power-law tails alongside gamma or log-normal bulk shapes, challenges models that focus on either pairwise competition or individual investment mechanisms. This study proposes and analyzes a unified model that integrates pairwise competition and individual investment via an adjustable parameter, $\alpha$. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the model's Gini coefficient and distributional shapes using the complementary cumulative distribution function and goodness-of-fit tests. Results show that the model captures a systematic transition in the bulk distribution from gamma like (low $\alpha$) to log-normal like (high $\alpha$). Additionally, intermediate levels of mechanism mixing can reduce inequality compared with the original mechanisms. However, it is difficult to distinguish heavy tails consistent with power-laws from log-normal tails. These findings highlight the importance of considering the interaction between different economic mechanisms but suggest that accurately replicating the empirical power-law tail requires more than the simple combination investigated.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian mobility citizen science complements expert mapping for enhancing inclusive neighborhood placemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11098v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities are complex systems that demand integrated approaches, with increasing attention focused on the neighborhood level. This study examines the interplay between expert-based mapping and citizen science in the Primer de Maig neighborhood of Granollers, Catalonia, Spain--an area marked by poor-quality public spaces and long-standing socio-economic challenges. Seventy-two residents were organized into 19 groups to record their pedestrian mobility while engaging in protocolized playful social actions. Their GPS identified opportunity units for meaningful public space activation. Although 56% of observed actions occurred within expert-defined units, the remaining 44% took place elsewhere. Clustering analysis of geo-located action stops revealed seven distinct clusters, highlighting overlooked areas with significant social potential. These findings underscore the complementarity of top-down and bottom-up approaches, demonstrating how citizen science and community science approaches enriches urban diagnostics by integrating subjective, community-based perspectives in public space placemaking and informing inclusive, adaptive sustainable urban transformation strategies.</description>

      <title>Universality of noise-induced transitions in nonlinear voter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.</description>

      <title>CoolWalks for active mobility in urban street networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walking is the most sustainable form of urban mobility, but is compromised by uncomfortable or unhealthy sun exposure, which is an increasing problem due to global warming. Shade from buildings can provide cooling and protection for pedestrians, but the extent of this potential benefit is unknown. Here we explore the potential for shaded walking, using building footprints and street networks from both synthetic and real cities. We introduce a route choice model with a sun avoidance parameter $\alpha$ and define the CoolWalkability metric to measure opportunities for walking in shade. We derive analytically that on a regular grid with constant building heights, CoolWalkability is independent of $\alpha$, and that the grid provides no CoolWalkability benefit for shade-seeking individuals compared to the shortest path. However, variations in street geometry and building heights create such benefits. We further uncover that the potential for shaded routing differs between grid-like and irregular street networks, forms local clusters, and is sensitive to the mapped network geometry. Our research identifies the limitations and potential of shade for cool, active travel, and is a first step towards a rigorous understanding of shade provision for sustainable mobility in cities.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of car traffic accidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a counting process to model the random occurrence in time of car traffic accidents, taking into account some aspects of the self-excitation typical of this phenomenon. By combining methods from probability and differential equations, we study this stochastic process in terms of its statistical moments and large-time trend. Moreover, we derive analytically the probability density functions of the times of occurrence of traffic accidents and of the time elapsing between two consecutive accidents. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our modelling approach by means of numerical simulations, which address also a comparison with real data of weekly trends of traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>What Leads to Administrative Bloat? A Dynamic Model of Administrative Cost and Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Administrative burden has been growing in organizations despite many counterproductive effects. We develop a system dynamics model to explain why this phenomenon occurs and to explore potential remedies. Prior literature has identified behavioral mechanisms leading to process creation, obsolescence, and removal, but typically examines them individually. Here, we integrate these mechanisms in the context of an organization allocating limited resources to competing priorities. We show that their interaction -- via accumulation and feedback loops -- leads to two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium, where administrative costs stabilizes, and runaway administrative bloat, where administrative costs and waste accumulate in a self-reinforcing cycle. The two outcomes are separated by a critical threshold in management behavioral parameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and the propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative burden. Rapid environmental change worsens the threshold, making bloat more likely. We evaluate several intervention strategies using simulation and find that lasting reductions in administrative costs and waste require two key commitments: a permanent shift in organizational priorities, and investment in discerning obsolete processes from useful ones. In contrast, temporary shifts and indiscriminate process cuts offer only short-lived relief. Counterintuitively, we find that prioritizing direct production can increase administrative waste. Our findings suggest that while dynamic environments make administrative bloat more likely, administrative bloat is not inevitable -- managers play a critical role in preventing or reversing it.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the role of heterogeneity and hyperedge overlap in explosive contagion on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce group-based compartmental modeling (GBCM), a mean-field framework for irreversible contagion in higher-order networks that captures structural heterogeneity and correlations across group sizes. Validated through numerical simulations, GBCM analytically disentangles the role of each interaction order to the global epidemic dynamics, revealing how heterogeneity and inter-order correlations jointly shape the onset of outbreaks and the emergence of explosive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.</description>
