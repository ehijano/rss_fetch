      <title>Unlocking new capabilities in the analysis of GC$\times$GC-TOFMS data with shift-invariant multi-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deconvolution algorithm, shift-invariant multi-linearity (SIML), which significantly enhances the analysis of data from a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometric detector (GC$\times$GC-TOFMS). Designed to address the challenges posed by retention time shifts and high noise levels, SIML incorporates wavelet-based smoothing and Fourier-Transform based shift-correction within the multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) framework. We benchmarked the SIML algorithm against traditional methods such as MCR-ALS and Parallel Factor Analysis 2 with flexible coupling (PARAFAC2$\times$N) using both simulated and real GC$\times$GC-TOFMS datasets. Our results demonstrate that SIML provides unique solutions with significantly improved robustness, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, where it maintains high accuracy in estimating mass spectra and concentrations. The enhanced reliability of quantitative analyses afforded by SIML underscores its potential for broad application in complex matrix analyses across environmental science, food chemistry, and biological research.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Detection of Risk Factors to Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Youth Athletes: A Smartwatch-Based Screening Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death among athletes of all age levels worldwide. Current prescreening methods for cardiac risk factors are largely ineffective, and implementing the International Olympic Committee recommendation for 12-lead ECG screening remains prohibitively expensive. To address these challenges, a preliminary comprehensive screening system (CSS) was developed to efficiently and economically screen large populations for risk factors to SCA. A protocol was established to measure a 4-lead ECG using an Apple Watch. Additionally, two key advances were introduced and validated: 1) A decomposition regression model to upscale 4-lead data to 12 leads, reducing ECG cost and usage complexity. 2) A deep learning model, the Transformer Auto-Encoder System (TAES), was designed to extract spatial and temporal features from the data for beat-based classification. TAES demonstrated an average sensitivity of 95.3% and specificity of 99.1% respectively in the testing dataset, outperforming human physicians in the same dataset (Se: 94%, Sp: 93%). Human subject trials (n = 30) validated the smartwatch protocol, with Bland-Altman analysis showing no statistical difference between the smartwatch vs. ECG protocol. Further validation of the complete CSS on a 20-subject cohort (10 affected, 10 controls) did not result in any misidentifications. This paper presents a mass screening system with the potential to achieve superior accuracy in high-throughput cardiac pre-participation evaluation compared to the clinical gold standard.</description>

      <title>3D Rigid Body Localization and Motion Estimation via Gaussian Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel solution to the moving rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) rotation angles and the translation distances, as well as the angular and translational velocities are estimated by only utilizing the relative range and Doppler measurements between the "anchor" sensors at the observer and "target" sensors of the rigid body. The proposed method is based on a bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework, employed to estimate the absolute sensor positions and velocities using a range- and Doppler-based received signal model, which is then utilized in the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized under a small-angle approximation. The method further incorporates a second bivariate GaBP designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation distances, including an interference cancellation (IC) refinement stage to improve the angle estimation performance, followed by the estimation of the angular and the translational velocities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via simulations, which confirms its improved performance compared to equivalent state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques.</description>

      <title>ECGtizer: a fully automated digitizing and signal recovery pipeline for electrocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiac pathologies, yet traditional paper-based ECG storage poses significant challenges for automated analysis. This study introduces ECGtizer, an open-source, fully automated tool designed to digitize paper ECGs and recover signals lost during storage. ECGtizer facilitates automated analyses using modern AI methods. It employs automated lead detection, three pixel-based signal extraction algorithms, and a deep learning-based signal reconstruction module. We evaluated ECGtizer on two datasets: a real-life cohort from the COVID-19 pandemic (JOCOVID) and a publicly available dataset (PTB-XL). Performance was compared with two existing methods: the fully automated ECGminer and the semi-automated PaperECG, which requires human intervention. ECGtizer's performance was assessed in terms of signal recovery and the fidelity of clinically relevant feature measurement. Additionally, we tested these tools on a third dataset (GENEREPOL) for downstream AI tasks. Results show that ECGtizer outperforms existing tools, with its ECGtizerFrag algorithm delivering superior signal recovery. While PaperECG demonstrated better outcomes than ECGminer, it required human input. ECGtizer enhances the usability of historical ECG data and supports advanced AI-based diagnostic methods, making it a valuable addition to the field of AI in ECG analysis.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Based Receivers for the Bistatic Sensing and Communication Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose receivers for bistatic sensing and communication that exploit a tensor modeling of the received signals. We consider a hybrid scenario where the sensing link knows the transmitted data to estimate the target parameters while the communication link operates semi-blindly in a direct data decoding approach without channel knowledge. We show that the signals received at the sensing receiver and communication receiver follow PARATUCK and PARAFAC tensor models, respectively. These models are exploited to obtain accurate estimates of the target parameters (at the sensing receiver) and the transmitted symbols and channels (at the user equipment). We discuss uniqueness conditions and provide some simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed receivers. Our experiments show that the sensing parameters are well estimated at moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while keeping good symbol error rate (SER) and channel normalized mean square error (NMSE) results for the communication link.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Receiver: Next Frontier of Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement. RAREs utilize the electron transition phenomenon of highly-excited atoms to interact with EM waves, thereby enabling wireless signal detection. Operating at the quantum scale, such new receivers have the potential to breakthrough the sensitivity limit of classical receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-aided communication systems. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classical receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, coverage, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the state-of-the-art design in RARE-aided wireless communications, exploring the latest progresses in frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Finally, we highlight several wireless-communication related open problems as important research directions.</description>

      <title>A Dipole Antenna with a Dynamic Balun for Wireless Security via Amplitude Based Directional Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to secure wireless operations using a simple dipole antenna with a dynamic unbalanced feeding structure. By rapidly switching between two states, a dynamic radiation pattern is generated, resulting in directional modulation. The current distribution on the arms of the dipole antenna are made asymmetric by the balun, which changes the relative phase between the feed currents. By rapidly switching between two mirrored states, the relative phase shift changes sign, causing the current distribution to manifest asymmetrically on the arms of the dipole antenna. The resultant far field radiation pattern is therefore asymmetric in both states, but mirrored between the two states. Rapid switching between the two states results in a far-field pattern that is dynamic in amplitude at all angles except for a narrow region of space, which is referred to as the information beam. The dynamic radiation pattern causes additional modulation on any transmitted or received signals, thereby obscuring the information at all angles outside the information beam. The proposed directional modulation technique is separate from both the antenna and the rest of the wireless system, and can thus be implemented in a black box form in wireless communications or sensing systems. We demonstrate the concept in a 1.86 GHz printed dipole antenna, demonstrating the transmission of 256-QAM signals.</description>

      <title>A Measurement-Based Spatially Consistent Channel Model for Distributed MIMO in Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless communication systems are envisioned to support ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), which will enable new applications such as compute offloading, wireless real-time control, and reliable monitoring. Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) is one of the most promising technologies for delivering URLLC. This paper classifies obstruction and derives a channel model from a D-MIMO measurement campaign carried out at a carrier frequency of 3.75 GHz with a bandwidth of 35 MHz using twelve distributed fully coherent dipole antennas in an industrial environment. Channel characteristics are investigated, including statistical measures such as small-scale fading, large-scale fading, delay spread, and transition rates between line-of-sight and obstructed line-of-sight conditions for the different antenna elements, laying the foundations for an accurate channel model for D-MIMO systems in industrial environments. Furthermore, correlations of large-scale fading between antennas, spatial correlation, and tail distributions are included to enable proper evaluations of reliability and rare events. Based on the results, a channel model for D-MIMO in industrial environments is presented together with a recipe for its implementation.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Algorithm for Joint Real-Time Synchronization, NLoS Identification, and Multi-Agent Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time, high-precision localization in large-scale wireless networks faces two primary challenges: clock offsets caused by network asynchrony and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a low-complexity real-time algorithm for joint synchronization and NLoS identification-based localization. For precise synchronization, we resolve clock offsets based on accumulated time-of-arrival measurements from all the past time instances, modeling it as a large-scale linear least squares (LLS) problem. To alleviate the high computational burden of solving this LLS, we introduce the blockwise recursive Moore-Penrose inverse (BRMP) technique, a generalized recursive least squares approach, and derive a simplified formulation of BRMP tailored specifically for the real-time synchronization problem. Furthermore, we formulate joint NLoS identification and localization as a robust least squares regression (RLSR) problem and address it by using an efficient iterative approach. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-nanosecond synchronization accuracy and centimeter-level localization precision, while maintaining low computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation from partial entries of random quantized samples. To balance trade-offs among the number of samples, the number of entries observed per sample, and the data resolution, we propose a ruler-based quantized Toeplitz covariance estimator. We derive non-asymptotic error bounds and analyze the convergence rates of the proposed estimator. Our results show that the estimator is near-optimal and imply that reducing data resolution within a certain range has a limited impact on the estimation accuracy. Numerical experiments are provided that validate our theoretical findings and show effectiveness of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensing Based Residual Recovery Algorithms and Hardware for Modulo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are essential components in modern data acquisition systems. A key design challenge is accommodating high dynamic range (DR) input signals without clipping. Existing solutions, such as oversampling, automatic gain control (AGC), and compander-based methods, have limitations in handling high-DR signals. Recently, the Unlimited Sampling Framework (USF) has emerged as a promising alternative. It uses a non-linear modulo operator to map high-DR signals within the ADC range. Existing recovery algorithms, such as higher-order differences (HODs), prediction-based methods, and beyond bandwidth residual recovery (B2R2), have shown potential but are either noise-sensitive, require high sampling rates, or are computationally intensive. To address these challenges, we propose LASSO-B2R2, a fast and robust recovery algorithm. Specifically, we demonstrate that the first-order difference of the residual (the difference between the folded and original samples) is sparse, and we derive an upper bound on its sparsity. This insight allows us to formulate the recovery as a sparse signal reconstruction problem using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Numerical simulations show that LASSO-B2R2 outperforms prior methods in terms of speed and robustness, though it requires a higher sampling rate at lower DR. To overcome this, we introduce the bits distribution mechanism, which allocates 1 bit from the total bit budget to identify modulo folding events. This reduces the recovery problem to a simple pseudo-inverse computation, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical simulations and a hardware prototype that captures 1-bit folding information, demonstrating its practical feasibility.</description>

      <title>Two-stage memetic algorithm for blind equalization in direct-sequence/code-division multiple-access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel memetic algorithm (MA) for the blind equalization of digital multiuser channels with Direct-Sequence / Code-Division Multiple-Access (DS/CDMA) sharing scheme. Equalization involves two different tasks, the estimation of: (1) channel response and (2) transmitted data. The corresponding channel model is first analyzed and then the MA is developed for this specific communication system. Convergence, population diversity and near-far resistance have been analyzed. Numerical experiments include comparative results with traditional multiuser detectors as well as with other nature-inspired approaches. Proposed receiver is proved to allow higher transmission rates over existing channels, while supporting stronger interferences as well as fading and time-variant effects. Required computation requisites are kept moderate in most cases. Proposed MA saves approximately 80% of computation time with respect to a standard genetic algorithm and about 15% with respect to a similar two-stage memetic algorithm, while keeping a statistically significant higher performance. Besides, complexity increases only by a factor of 5, when the number of active users doubles, instead of 32x found for the optimum maximum likelihood algorithm. The proposed method also exhibits high near-far resistance and achieves accurate channel response estimates, becoming an interesting and viable alternative to so far proposed methods.</description>

      <title>CovNet: Covariance Information-Assisted CSI Feedback for FDD Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel covariance information-assisted channel state information (CSI) feedback scheme for frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike most existing CSI feedback schemes, which rely on instantaneous CSI only, the proposed CovNet leverages CSI covariance information to achieve high-performance CSI reconstruction, primarily consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architecture. To efficiently utilize covariance information, we propose a covariance information processing procedure and sophisticatedly design the covariance information processing network (CIPN) to further process it. Moreover, the feed-forward network (FFN) in CovNet is designed to jointly leverage the 2D characteristics of the CSI matrix in the angle and delay domains. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed network effectively leverages covariance information and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scheme across the full compression ratio (CR) range.</description>

      <title>Shift-invariant spaces, bandlimited spaces and reproducing kernel spaces with shift-invariant kernels on undirected finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of graph shift-invariant space (GSIS) on an undirected finite graph, which is the linear space of graph signals being invariant under graph shifts, and we study its bandlimiting, kernel reproducing and sampling properties.
  Graph bandlimited spaces have been widely applied where large datasets on networks need to be handled efficiently. In this paper, we show that every GSIS is a bandlimited space, and every bandlimited space is a principal GSIS.
  Functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with shift-invariant kernel could be learnt with significantly low computational cost. In this paper, we demonstrate that every GSIS is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with a shift-invariant kernel.
  Based on the nested Krylov structure of GSISs in the spatial domain, we propose a novel sampling and reconstruction algorithm with finite steps, with its performance tested for well-localized signals on circulant graphs and flight delay dataset of the 50 busiest airports in the USA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles, necessitating a revolutionary architecture to support the growing demands for computational power. Cloud computing has become the driving force behind this transformation. However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Predicting Workload in Virtual Flight Simulations using EEG Features (Including Post-hoc Analysis in Appendix)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective cognitive workload management has a major impact on the safety and performance of pilots. Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from immersive, high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations enhances ecological validity and allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios based on individual cognitive states. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into inter-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. EEG data were collected from 52 non-pilot participants conducting flight tasks in an aircraft simulation, after which they reported cognitive workload using the NASA Task Load Index. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload using two feature sets extracted from the EEG data: 1) spectral features (Baseline model), and 2) a combination of spectral and connectivity features (Connectivity model), both within the alpha, beta, and theta band ranges. Results showed that the performance of the Connectivity model surpassed the Baseline model. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) provided insights into the most influential workload-predicting features, highlighting the potential dominance of parietal-directed connectivity in managing cognitive workload during simulated flight. Further research on other connectivity metrics and alternative models (such as deep learning) in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the possibility of a real-time BCI for the prediction of workload under safety-critical operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Aided NOMA: Joint Antenna Positioning, Precoding, and Decoding Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for multi-user downlink communication, where the base station (BS) is equipped with a fixed-position antenna (FPA) array to serve multiple MA-enabled users. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all the users by jointly optimizing the MA positioning of each user, the precoding matrix at the BS, and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding indicator matrix at the users, subject to a set of constraints including the limited movement area of the MAs, the maximum transmit power of the BS, and the SIC decoding condition. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a two-loop iterative optimization algorithm that combines the hippopotamus optimization (HO) method with the alternating optimization (AO) method to obtain a suboptimal solution efficiently. Specifically, in the inner loop, the complex-valued precoding matrix and the binary decoding indicator matrix are optimized alternatively by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique with customized greedy search to maximize the minimum achievable rate for the given positions of the MAs. In the outer loop, each user's antenna position is updated using the HO algorithm, following a novel nature-inspired intelligent optimization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively avoid local optimum for highly coupled variables and significantly improve the rate performance of the NOMA system compared to the conventional FPA system as well as other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous Edge Content Caching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proactive caching is essential for minimizing latency and improving Quality of Experience (QoE) in multi-server edge networks. Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) is a promising approach for developing cache policies tailored to dynamic content requests. However, FDRL faces challenges such as an expanding caching action space due to increased content numbers and difficulty in adapting global information to heterogeneous edge environments. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Caching, called PF-DRL-Ca, with the aim to maximize system utility while satisfying caching capability constraints. To manage the expanding action space, we employ a new DRL algorithm, Multi-head Deep Q-Network (MH-DQN), which reshapes the action output layers of DQN into a multi-head structure where each head generates a sub-dimensional action. We next integrate the proposed MH-DQN into a personalized federated training framework, employing a layer-wise approach for training to derive a personalized model that can adapt to heterogeneous environments while exploiting the global information to accelerate learning convergence. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MH-DQN over traditional DRL algorithms on a single server, as well as the advantages of the personal federated training architecture compared to other frameworks.</description>

      <title>A MARL Based Multi-Target Tracking Algorithm Under Jamming Against Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an increasingly important role in military operations and social life. Among all application scenarios, multi-target tracking tasks accomplished by UAV swarms have received extensive attention. However, when UAVs use radar to track targets, the tracking performance can be severely compromised by jammers. To track targets in the presence of jammers, UAVs can use passive radar to position the jammer. This paper proposes a system where a UAV swarm selects the radar's active or passive work mode to track multiple differently located and potentially jammer-carrying targets. After presenting the optimization problem and proving its solving difficulty, we use a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to solve this control problem. We also propose a mechanism based on simulated annealing algorithm to avoid cases where UAV actions violate constraints. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications in Downlink FDD MIMO without CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a precoding framework for frequency division duplex (FDD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Specifically, we aim to maximize ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) while satisfying a sensing beam pattern constraint defined by the mean squared error (MSE). Our method reconstructs downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from uplink (UL) training signals using partial reciprocity, eliminating the need for CSI feedback. To mitigate interference caused by imperfect DL CSI reconstruction and sensing operations, we adopt rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We observe that the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed channel effectively compensates for CSI imperfections, affecting both communication and sensing performance. To obtain this, we devise an observed Fisher information-based estimation technique. We then optimize the precoder by solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, jointly updating the precoding vector and Lagrange multipliers, and solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency to maximize SE. The numerical results show that the proposed design achieves precise beam pattern control, maximizes SE, and significantly improves the sensing-communication trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art methods in FDD ISAC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Shared Attention-based Autoencoder with Hierarchical Fusion-based Graph Convolution Network for sEEG SOZ Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagnosing seizure onset zone (SOZ) is a challenge in neurosurgery, where stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) serves as a critical technique. In sEEG SOZ identification, the existing studies focus solely on the intra-patient representation of epileptic information, overlooking the general features of epilepsy across patients and feature interdependencies between feature elements in each contact site. In order to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the shared attention-based autoencoder (sATAE). sATAE is trained by sEEG data across all patients, with attention blocks introduced to enhance the representation of interdependencies between feature elements. Considering the spatial diversity of sEEG across patients, we introduce graph-based method for identification SOZ of each patient. However, the current graph-based methods for sEEG SOZ identification rely exclusively on static graphs to model epileptic networks. Inspired by the finding of neuroscience that epileptic network is intricately characterized by the interplay of sophisticated equilibrium between fluctuating and stable states, we design the hierarchical fusion-based graph convolution network (HFGCN) to identify the SOZ. HFGCN integrates the dynamic and static characteristics of epileptic networks through hierarchical weighting across different hierarchies, facilitating a more comprehensive learning of epileptic features and enriching node information for sEEG SOZ identification. Combining sATAE and HFGCN, we perform comprehensive experiments with sATAE-HFGCN on the self-build sEEG dataset, which includes sEEG data from 17 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The results show that our method, sATAE-HFGCN, achieves superior performance for identifying the SOZ of each patient, effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges, providing an efficient solution for sEEG-based SOZ identification.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty, and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computation by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) has emerged as a promising tool for real-time traffic monitoring in densely populated areas. In this paper, we present a novel concept that integrates DAS data with co-located visual information. We use YOLO-derived vehicle location and classification from camera inputs as labeled data to train a detection and classification neural network utilizing DAS data only. Our model achieves a performance exceeding 94% for detection and classification, and about 1.2% false alarm rate. We illustrate the model's application in monitoring traffic over a week, yielding statistical insights that could benefit future smart city developments. Our approach highlights the potential of combining fiber-optic sensors with visual information, focusing on practicality and scalability, protecting privacy, and minimizing infrastructure costs. To encourage future research, we share our dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video streaming services depend on the underlying communication infrastructure and available network resources to offer ultra-low latency, high-quality content delivery. Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) provides a dynamic, programmable, and flexible RAN architecture that can be configured to support the requirements of time-critical applications. This work considers a setup in which the constrained network resources are supplemented by \gls{GAI} and \gls{MEC} {techniques} in order to reach a satisfactory video quality. Specifically, we implement a novel semantic control channel that enables \gls{MEC} to support low-latency applications by tight coupling among the ORAN xApp, \gls{MEC}, and the control channel. The proposed concepts are experimentally verified with an actual ORAN setup that supports video streaming. The performance evaluation includes the \gls{PSNR} metric and end-to-end latency. Our findings reveal that latency adjustments can yield gains in image \gls{PSNR}, underscoring the trade-off potential for optimized video quality in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>AoI in Context-Aware Hybrid Radio-Optical IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the surge in IoT devices ranging from wearables to smart homes, prompt transmission is crucial. The Age of Information (AoI) emerges as a critical metric in this context, representing the freshness of the information transmitted across the network. This paper studies hybrid IoT networks that employ Optical Communication (OC) as a reinforcement medium to Radio Frequency (RF). We formulate a quadratic convex optimization that adopts a Pareto optimization strategy to dynamically schedule the communication between devices and select their corresponding communication technology, aiming to balance the maximization of network throughput with the minimization of energy usage and the frequency of switching between technologies. To mitigate the impact of dominant sub-objectives and their scale disparity, the designed approach employs a regularization method that approximates adequate Pareto coefficients. Simulation results show that the OC supplementary integration alongside RF enhances the network's overall performances and significantly reduces the Mean AoI and Peak AoI, allowing the collection of the freshest possible data using the best available communication technology.</description>

      <title>System-Level Experimental Evaluation of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for NextG Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are a promising technique for enhancing the performance of Next Generation (NextG) wireless communication systems in terms of both spectral and energy efficiency, as well as resource utilization. However, current RIS research has primarily focused on theoretical modeling and Physical (PHY) layer considerations only. Full protocol stack emulation and accurate modeling of the propagation characteristics of the wireless channel are necessary for studying the benefits introduced by RIS technology across various spectrum bands and use-cases. In this paper, we propose, for the first time: (i) accurate PHY layer RIS-enabled channel modeling through Geometry-Based Stochastic Models (GBSMs), leveraging the QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa) open-source statistical ray-tracer; (ii) optimized resource allocation with RISs by comprehensively studying energy efficiency and power control on different portions of the spectrum through a single-leader multiple-followers Stackelberg game theoretical approach; (iii) full-stack emulation and performance evaluation of RIS-assisted channels with SCOPE/srsRAN for Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) applications in the worlds largest emulator of wireless systems with hardware-in-the-loop, namely Colosseum. Our findings indicate (i) the significant power savings in terms of energy efficiency achieved with RIS-assisted topologies, especially in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band; and (ii) the benefits introduced for Sub-6 GHz band User Equipments (UEs), where the deployment of a relatively small RIS (e.g., in the order of 100 RIS elements) can result in decreased levels of latency for URLLC services in resource-constrained environments.</description>

Abstract: We aim at the solution of inverse problems in imaging, by combining a penalized sparse representation of image patches with an unconstrained smooth one. This allows for a straightforward interpretation of the reconstruction. We formulate the optimization as a bilevel problem. The inner problem deploys classical algorithms while the outer problem optimizes the dictionary and the regularizer parameters through supervised learning. The process is carried out via implicit differentiation and gradient-based optimization. We evaluate our method for denoising, super-resolution, and compressed-sensing magnetic-resonance imaging. We compare it to other classical models as well as deep-learning-based methods and show that it always outperforms the former and also the latter in some instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents DISC, a dataset of millimeterwave channel impulse response measurements for integrated human activity sensing and communication. This is the first dataset collected with a software-defined radio testbed that transmits 60 GHz IEEE 802-11ay-compliant packets and estimates the channel response including reflections of the signal on the moving body parts of subjects moving in an indoor environment. The provided data consists of three parts, for more than 2 hours of channel measurements with high temporal resolution. DISC contains the contribution of 7 subjects performing 5 different activities, and includes data collected from two distinct environments. Differently from available radar-based millimeterwave sensing datasets, our measurements are collected using both uniform packet transmission times and sparse traffic patterns from real Wi-Fi deployments. We develop, train, and release open-source baseline algorithms to perform human sensing tasks based on DISC. Our results demonstrate that DISC can serve as a multi-purpose benchmarking tool for machine learning-based human activity recognition, radio frequency gait analysis, and sparse sensing algorithms for next-generation integrated sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Static Background Removal in Vehicular Radar: Filtering in Azimuth-Elevation-Doppler Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-collision assistance, integral to the current drive towards increased vehicular autonomy, relies heavily on precise detection and localization of moving targets in the vehicle's vicinity. A crucial step towards achieving this is the removal of static objects from the scene, thereby enhancing the detection and localization of dynamic targets - a pivotal aspect in augmenting overall system performance. In this paper, we propose a static background removal algorithm tailored for automotive scenarios, designed for common frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. This algorithm effectively eliminates reflections corresponding to static backgrounds from radar images through a two-step process: 4-dimensional (4D) radar imaging and filtering in the azimuth-elevation-Doppler domain. Our proposed approach is underpinned by a model customized for FMCW radar signals, incorporating a time-division multiplexing-based multiple-input multiple-output scheme on the non-uniform radar array. Furthermore, our filtering process requires knowledge of the 3-dimensional (3D) radar ego-motion velocity, typically obtained from an external sensor. To address scenarios where such sensors are unavailable, we introduce a self-contained 3D ego-motion estimation approach. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm using both simulated and real-world data, analyzing its sensitivity and time complexity in comparison to established baselines.</description>

      <title>Individual Identification Using Radar-Measured Respiratory and Heartbeat Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a method for radar-based identification of individuals using a combination of their respiratory and heartbeat features. In the proposed method, the target individual's respiratory features are extracted using the modified raised-cosine-waveform model and their heartbeat features are extracted using the mel-frequency cepstral analysis technique. To identify a suitable combination of features and a classifier, we compare the performances of nine methods based on various combinations of three feature vectors with three classifiers. The accuracy of the proposed method in performing individual identification is evaluated using a 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar system with an antenna array in two experimental scenarios and we demonstrate the importance of use of the combination of the respiratory and heartbeat features in achieving accurate identification of individuals. The proposed method achieves accuracy of 96.33% when applied to a five-day dataset of six participants and 99.39% when applied to a public one-day dataset of thirty participants.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel Optimization for UAV Video Coding and Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video coding and transmission in scenarios such as emergency rescue and environmental monitoring. Unlike existing methods of modeling UAV video source coding and channel transmission separately, we investigate the joint source-channel optimization issue for video coding and transmission. Particularly, we design eight-dimensional delay-power-rate-distortion models in terms of source coding and channel transmission and characterize the correlation between video coding and transmission, with which a joint source-channel optimization problem is formulated. Its objective is to minimize end-to-end distortion and UAV power consumption by optimizing fine-grained parameters related to UAV video coding and transmission. This problem is confirmed to be a challenging sequential-decision and non-convex optimization problem. We therefore decompose it into a family of repeated optimization problems by Lyapunov optimization and design an approximate convex optimization scheme with provable performance guarantees to tackle these problems. Based on the theoretical transformation, we propose a Lyapunov repeated iteration (LyaRI) algorithm. Both objective and subjective experiments are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of LyaRI. The results indicate that, compared to its counterparts, LyaRI achieves better video quality and stability performance, with a 47.74% reduction in the variance of the obtained encoding bitrate.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning of Transmitter and Receiver Filters in Bandwidth Limited Fiber Optic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of end-to-end (E2E) learning for joint optimization of pulse-shaper and receiver filter to reduce intersymbol interference (ISI) in bandwidth-limited communication systems. We investigate this in two numerical simulation models: 1) an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with bandwidth limitation and 2) an intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) link employing an electro-absorption modulator. For both simulation models, we implement a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme to ensure that the learned filters adhere to the bandwidth constraints of the WDM channels. Our findings reveal that E2E learning greatly surpasses traditional single-sided transmitter pulse-shaper or receiver filter optimization methods, achieving significant performance gains in terms of symbol error rate with shorter filter lengths. These results suggest that E2E learning can decrease the complexity and enhance the performance of future high-speed optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion for Regional Sea-Level Data Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Analysis for CR-NOMA Aided Uplink Systems with Randomly Arrived Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the application of cognitive radio inspired non-orthogonal multiple access (CR-NOMA) to reduce age of information (AoI) for uplink transmission. In particular, a time division multiple access (TDMA) based legacy network is considered, where each user is allocated with a dedicated time slot to transmit its status update information. The CR-NOMA is implemented as an add-on to the TDMA legacy network, which enables each user to have more opportunities to transmit by sharing other user's time slots. A rigorous analytical framework is developed to obtain the expressions for AoIs achieved by CR-NOMA with and without re-transmission, by taking the randomness of the status update generating process into consideration. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the developed analysis. It is shown that the AoI can be significantly reduced by applying CR-NOMA compared to TDMA. Moreover, the use of re-transmission is helpful to reduce AoI, especially when the status arrival rate is low.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

      <title>Joint Node Selection and Resource Allocation Optimization for Cooperative Sensing with a Shared Wireless Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a cooperative sensing framework in the context of future multi-functional network with both communication and sensing ability, where one base station (BS) serves as a sensing transmitter and several nearby BSs serve as sensing receivers. Each receiver receives the sensing signal reflected by the target and communicates with the fusion center (FC) through a wireless multiple access channel (MAC) for cooperative target localization. To improve the localization performance, we present a hybrid information-signal domain cooperative sensing (HISDCS) design, where each sensing receiver transmits both the estimated time delay/effective reflecting coefficient and the received sensing signal sampled around the estimated time delay to the FC. Then, we propose to minimize the number of channel uses by utilizing an efficient Karhunen-Lo\'eve transformation (KLT) encoding scheme for signal quantization and proper node selection, under the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) constraint and the capacity limits of MAC. A novel matrix-inequality constrained successive convex approximation (MCSCA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the wireless backhaul resource allocation, together with a greedy strategy for node selection. Despite the high non-convexness of the considered problem, we prove that the proposed MCSCA algorithm is able to converge to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions of a relaxed problem obtained by relaxing the discrete variables. Besides, a low-complexity quantization bit reallocation algorithm is designed, which does not perform explicit node selection, and is able to harvest most of the performance gain brought by HISDCS. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to show that the proposed HISDCS design is able to significantly outperform the baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform Square Index Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is a cornerstone for several signal processing applications. Many of these applications operate in real-time, making the computational complexity of the DFT a critical performance indicator to be optimized. Unfortunately, whether the $\mathcal{O}(N\log_2 N)$ time complexity of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be outperformed remains an unresolved question in the theory of computation. However, in many applications of the DFT -- such as compressive sensing, image processing, and wideband spectral analysis -- only a small fraction of the output signal needs to be computed because the signal is sparse. This motivates the development of algorithms that compute specific DFT coefficients more efficiently than the FFT algorithm. In this article, we show that the number of points of some DFT coefficients can be dramatically reduced by means of elementary mathematical properties. We present an algorithm that compacts the square index coefficients (SICs) of DFT (i.e., $X_{k\sqrt{N}}$, $k=0,1,\cdots, \sqrt{N}-1$, for a square number $N$) from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$ points at the expense of $N-1$ complex sums and no multiplication. Based on this, any regular DFT algorithm can be straightforwardly applied to compute the SICs with a reduced number of complex multiplications. If $N$ is a power of two, one can combine our algorithm with the FFT to calculate all SICs in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}\log_2\sqrt{N})$ time complexity.</description>

      <title>Towards joint graph learning and sampling set selection from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the problem of sampling graph signals in scenarios where the graph structure is not predefined and must be inferred from data. In this scenario, existing approaches rely on a two-step process, where a graph is learned first, followed by sampling. More generally, graph learning and graph signal sampling have been studied as two independent problems in the literature. This work provides a foundational step towards jointly optimizing the graph structure and sampling set. Our main contribution, Vertex Importance Sampling (VIS), is to show that the sampling set can be effectively determined from the vertex importance (node weights) obtained from graph learning. We further propose Vertex Importance Sampling with Repulsion (VISR), a greedy algorithm where spatially -separated "important" nodes are selected to ensure better reconstruction. Empirical results on simulated data show that sampling using VIS and VISR leads to competitive reconstruction performance and lower complexity than the conventional two-step approach of graph learning followed by graph sampling.</description>
