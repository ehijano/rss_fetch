      <title>Long-Term Causal Inference with Many Noisy Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for estimating long-term treatment effects with many short-term proxy outcomes: a central challenge when experimenting on digital platforms. We formalize this challenge as a latent variable problem where observed proxies are noisy measures of a low-dimensional set of unobserved surrogates that mediate treatment effects. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that regularized regression methods substantially outperform naive proxy selection. We show in particular that the bias of Ridge regression decreases as more proxies are added, with closed-form expressions for the bias-variance tradeoff. We illustrate our method with an empirical application to the California GAIN experiment.</description>

      <title>The Promise of Time-Series Foundation Models for Agricultural Forecasting: Evidence from Marketing Year Average Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting agricultural markets remains a core challenge in business analytics, where nonlinear dynamics, structural breaks, and sparse data have historically limited the gains from increasingly complex econometric and machine learning models. As a result, a long-standing belief in the literature is that simple time-series methods often outperform more advanced alternatives. This paper provides the first systematic evidence that this belief no longer holds in the modern era of time-series foundation models (TSFMs). Using USDA ERS data from 1997-2025, we evaluate 17 forecasting approaches across four model classes, assessing monthly forecasting performance and benchmarking against Market Year Average (MYA) price predictions. This period spans multiple agricultural cycles, major policy changes, and major market disruptions, with substantial cross-commodity price volatility. Focusing on five state-of-the-art TSFMs, we show that zero-shot foundation models (with only historical prices and without any additional covariates) consistently outperform traditional time-series methods, machine learning models, and deep learning architectures trained from scratch. Among them, Time-MoE delivers the largest accuracy gains, improving forecasts by 45% (MAE) overall and by more than 50% for corn and soybeans relative to USDA benchmarks. These results point to a paradigm shift in agricultural forecasting: while earlier generations of advanced models struggled to surpass simple benchmarks, modern pre-trained foundation models achieve substantial and robust improvements, offering a scalable and powerful new framework for highstakes predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>Sign Accuracy, Mean-Squared Error and the Rate of Zero Crossings: a Generalized Forecast Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting entails a complex estimation challenge, as it requires balancing multiple, often conflicting, priorities and objectives. Traditional forecast optimization criteria typically focus on a single metric -such as minimizing the mean squared error (MSE)- which may overlook other important aspects of predictive performance. In response, we introduce a novel approach called the Smooth Sign Accuracy (SSA) framework, which simultaneously considers sign accuracy, MSE, and the frequency of sign changes in the predictor. This addresses a fundamental trade-off (the so-called accuracy-smoothness (AS) dilemma) in prediction. The SSA criterion thus enables the integration of various design objectives related to AS forecasting performance, effectively generalizing conventional MSE-based metrics. We further extend this methodology to accommodate non-stationary, integrated processes, with particular emphasis on controlling the predictor's monotonicity. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach through an application to, and customization of, established business cycle analysis tools, highlighting its versatility across diverse forecasting contexts.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Estimation in Heterogeneous Coefficient Panel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an empirical Bayes (EB) G-modeling framework for short-panel linear models with multidimensional heterogeneity and nonparametric prior. Specifically, we allow heterogeneous intercepts, slopes, dynamics, and a non-spherical error covariance structure. We establish identification and consistency of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) under general conditions, and provide low-level sufficient conditions for several models of empirical interest. Conditions for regret consistency of the resulting EB estimators are also established. The NPMLE is computed using a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow algorithm adapted to panel regressions. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that the slope coefficient for potential experience is substantially heterogeneous and negatively correlated with the random intercept, and that error variances and autoregressive coefficients vary significantly across individuals. The EB estimates reduce mean squared prediction errors relative to individual maximum likelihood estimates.</description>

      <title>Riesz Representer Fitting under Bregman Divergence: A Unified Framework for Debiased Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the Riesz representer is a central problem in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation. Various methods for Riesz representer estimation have been proposed, including Riesz regression and covariate balancing. This study unifies these methods within a single framework. Our framework fits a Riesz representer model to the true Riesz representer under a Bregman divergence, which includes the squared loss and the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as special cases. We show that the squared loss corresponds to Riesz regression, and the KL divergence corresponds to tailored loss minimization, where the dual solutions correspond to stable balancing weights and entropy balancing weights, respectively, under specific model specifications. We refer to our method as generalized Riesz regression, and we refer to the associated duality as automatic covariate balancing. Our framework also generalizes density ratio fitting under a Bregman divergence to Riesz representer estimation, and it includes various applications beyond density ratio estimation. We also provide a convergence analysis for both cases where the model class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and where it is a neural network.</description>

      <title>Crypto Pricing with Hidden Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate risk premia in the cross-section of cryptocurrency returns using the Giglio-Xiu (2021) three-pass approach, allowing for omitted latent factors alongside observed stock-market and crypto-market factors. Using weekly data on a broad universe of large cryptocurrencies, we find that crypto expected returns load on both crypto-specific factors and selected equity-industry factors associated with technology and profitability, consistent with increased integration between crypto and traditional markets. In addition, we study non-tradable state variables capturing investor sentiment (Fear and Greed), speculative rotation (Altcoin Season Index), and security shocks (hacked value scaled by market capitalization), which are new to the literature. Relative to conventional Fama-MacBeth estimates, the latent-factor approach yields materially different premia for key factors, highlighting the importance of controlling for unobserved risks in crypto asset pricing.</description>

      <title>Forecasted Treatment Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider estimation and inference of the effects of a policy in the absence of an untreated or control group. We obtain unbiased estimators of individual (heterogeneous) treatment effects and a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the average treatment effect. Our estimator averages, across individuals, the difference between observed post-treatment outcomes and unbiased forecasts of their counterfactuals, based on a (short) time series of pre-treatment data. The paper emphasizes the importance of focusing on forecast unbiasedness rather than accuracy when the end goal is estimation of average treatment effects. We show that simple basis function regressions ensure forecast unbiasedness for a broad class of data generating processes for the counterfactuals. In contrast, forecasting based on a specific parametric model requires stronger assumptions and is prone to misspecification and estimation bias. We show that our method can replicate the findings of some previous empirical studies but it does so without using an untreated or control group.</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Effects in Information Provision Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11387v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard estimators in information provision experiments place more weight on individuals who update their beliefs more in response to new information. This paper shows that, in practice, these individuals who update the most have the weakest causal effects of beliefs on outcomes. Standard estimators therefore understate these causal effects. I propose an alternative local least squares (LLS) estimator that recovers a representative unweighted average effect in a broad class of learning rate models that generalize Bayesian updating. I reanalyze six published studies. In five, estimates of the causal effects of beliefs on outcomes increase; in two, they more than double.</description>

      <title>A Kernelization-Based Approach to Nonparametric Binary Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new estimator for nonparametric binary choice models that does not impose a parametric structure on either the systematic function of covariates or the distribution of the error term. A key advantage of our approach is its computational scalability in the number of covariates. For instance, even when assuming a normal error distribution as in probit models, commonly used sieves for approximating an unknown function of covariates can lead to a large-dimensional optimization problem when the number of covariates is moderate. Our approach, motivated by kernel methods in machine learning, views certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces as special sieve spaces, coupled with spectral cut-off regularization for dimension reduction. We establish the consistency of the proposed estimator and asymptotic normality of the plug-in estimator for weighted average partial derivatives. Simulation studies show that, compared to parametric estimation methods, the proposed method effectively improves finite sample performance in cases of misspecification, and has a rather mild efficiency loss if the model is correctly specified. Using administrative data on the grant decisions of US asylum applications to immigration courts, along with nine case-day variables on weather and pollution, we re-examine the effect of outdoor temperature on court judges' ``mood'', and thus, their grant decisions.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference for Experiments with Latent Outcomes: Key Results and Their Implications for Design and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How should researchers analyze randomized experiments in which the main outcome is latent and measured in multiple ways but each measure contains some degree of error? We first identify a critical study-specific noncomparability problem in existing methods for handling multiple measurements, which often rely on strong modeling assumptions or arbitrary standardization. Such approaches render the resulting estimands noncomparable across studies. To address the problem, we describe design-based approaches that enable researchers to identify causal parameters of interest, suggest ways that experimental designs can be augmented so as to make assumptions more credible, and discuss empirical tests of key assumptions. We show that when experimental researchers invest appropriately in multiple outcome measures, an optimally weighted scaled index of these measures enables researchers to obtain efficient and interpretable estimates of causal parameters by applying standard regression. An empirical application illustrates the gains in precision and robustness that multiple outcome measures can provide.</description>

      <title>Making Interpretable Discoveries from Unstructured Data: A High-Dimensional Multiple Hypothesis Testing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social scientists are increasingly turning to unstructured datasets to unlock new empirical insights, e.g., estimating descriptive statistics of or causal effects on quantitative measures derived from text, audio, or video data. In many such settings, unsupervised analysis is of primary interest, in that the researcher does not want to (or cannot) pre-specify all important aspects of the unstructured data to measure; they are interested in "discovery." This paper proposes a general and flexible framework for pursuing discovery from unstructured data in a statistically principled way. The framework leverages recent methods from the literature on machine learning interpretability to map unstructured data points to high-dimensional, sparse, and interpretable "dictionaries" of concepts; computes statistics of dictionary entries for testing relevant concept-level hypotheses; performs selective inference on these hypotheses using algorithms validated by new results in high-dimensional central limit theory, producing a selected set ("discoveries"); and both generates and evaluates human-interpretable natural language descriptions of these discoveries. The proposed framework has few researcher degrees of freedom, is fully replicable, and is cheap to implement -- both in terms of financial cost and researcher time. Applications to recent descriptive and causal analyses of unstructured data in empirical economics are explored. An open source Jupyter notebook is provided for researchers to implement the framework in their own projects.</description>

      <title>Quantile Selection in the Gender Pay Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to estimate selection-corrected quantiles of the gender wage gap. Our method employs instrumental variables that explain variation in the latent variable but, conditional on the latent process, do not directly affect selection. We provide semiparametric identification of the quantile parameters without imposing parametric restrictions on the selection probability, derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator based on constrained selection probability weighting, and demonstrate how the approach applies to the Roy model of labor supply. Using German administrative data, we analyze the distribution of the gender gap in full-time earnings. We find pronounced positive selection among women at the lower end, especially those with less education, which widens the gender gap in this segment, and strong positive selection among highly educated men at the top, which narrows the gender wage gap at upper quantiles.</description>

      <title>Testing Monotonicity in a Finite Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the extent to which we can learn from a completely randomized experiment whether all individuals have treatment effects that are weakly of the same sign, a condition we call monotonicity. From a classical sampling perspective, it is well-known that monotonicity is not falsifiable. By contrast, we show from the design-based perspective -- in which the units in the population are fixed and only treatment assignment is stochastic -- that the distribution of treatment effects in the finite population (and hence whether monotonicity holds) is formally identified. We argue, however, that the usual definition of identification is unnatural in the design-based setting because it imagines knowing the distribution of outcomes over different treatment assignments for the same units. We thus evaluate the informativeness of the data by the extent to which it enables frequentist testing and Bayesian updating. We show that frequentist tests can have nontrivial power against some alternatives, but power is generically limited. Likewise, we show that there exist (non-degenerate) Bayesian priors that never update about whether monotonicity holds. We conclude that, despite the formal identification result, the ability to learn about monotonicity from data in practice is severely limited.</description>

      <title>Ordinary Least Squares as an Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that ordinary least squares (OLS) predictions can be rewritten as the output of a restricted attention module, akin to those forming the backbone of large language models. This connection offers an alternative perspective on attention beyond the conventional information retrieval framework, making it more accessible to researchers and analysts with a background in traditional statistics. It falls into place when OLS is framed as a similarity-based method in a transformed regressor space, distinct from the standard view based on partial correlations. In fact, the OLS solution can be recast as the outcome of an alternative problem: minimizing squared prediction errors by optimizing the embedding space in which training and test vectors are compared via inner products. Rather than estimating coefficients directly, we equivalently learn optimal encoding and decoding operations for predictors. From this vantage point, OLS maps naturally onto the query-key-value structure of attention mechanisms. Building on this foundation, I discuss key elements of Transformer-style attention and draw connections to classic ideas from time series econometrics.</description>

      <title>The heterogeneous causal effects of the EU's Cohesion Fund</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper estimates the causal effect of EU cohesion policy on regional output and investment, focusing on the Cohesion Fund (CF), a comparatively understudied instrument. Departing from standard approaches such as regression discontinuity (RDD) and instrumental variables (IV), we use a recently developed causal inference method based on matrix completion within a factor model framework. This yields a new framework to evaluate the CF and to characterize the time-varying distribution of its causal effects across EU regions, along with distributional metrics relevant for policy assessment. Our results show that average treatment effects conceal substantial heterogeneity and may lead to misleading conclusions about policy effectiveness. The CF's impact is front-loaded, peaking within the first seven years after a region's initial inclusion. During this first seven-year funding cycle, the distribution of effects is right-skewed with relatively thick tails, indicating generally positive but uneven gains across regions. Effects are larger for regions that are relatively poorer at baseline, and we find a non-linear, diminishing-returns relationship: beyond a threshold, the impact declines as the ratio of CF receipts to regional gross value added (GVA) increases.</description>
