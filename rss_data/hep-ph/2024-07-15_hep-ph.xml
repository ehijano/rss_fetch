      <title>Analysis of the hidden-charm-hidden-strange tetraquark mass spectrum via the QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we construct the diquark-antidiquark type currents to study the mass spectrum of the ground state hidden-charm-hidden-strange tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ via the QCD sum rules in a comprehensive way. We update old calculations and perform new calculations rigorously, and take account of the light flavor $SU(3)$ breaking effects in a consistent way. And we make possible assignments for the $X(3960)$, $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$, $X(4685)$ and $X(4700)$. Furthermore, we consider our previous works, and make possible assignments of the new LHCb states $h_c(4000)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4010)$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $C$ and $CP$ Violation in $\eta \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay $\eta\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is an ideal process in which to study flavor-conserving $C$ and $CP$ violation beyond the Standard Model. We deduce the $C$- and $CP$-odd quark operators that contribute to $\eta\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ originating from the mass-dimension 6 Standard Model effective field theory. The corresponding hadron-level operators that generate a non-vanishing $I=0$ amplitude at order $p^6$ in the chiral effective theory are presented for the first time, in addition to the leading order operatorsascribed to the $I=2$ final state. By fitting the KLOE-2 and the most recent BESIII experimental data, we determine the coefficients of the lowest order $I=0$ and $I=2$ amplitudes and estimate the potential new physics energy scale. We also perform an impact study of the future $\eta\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <title>A particle's perspective on screening mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms are a natural method for suppressing long-range forces in scalar-tensor theories as they link the local background density to their strength. Focusing on Brans-Dicke theories, those including a non-minimal coupling between a scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar, we study the origin of these screening mechanisms from a field theory perspective, considering the influence of the Standard Model on the mechanisms. Additionally, we further consider the role of scale symmetries on screening, demonstrating that only certain sectors, those obtaining their mass via the Higgs mechanism, contribute to screening the fifth forces. This has significant implications for baryons, which obtain most of their mass from the gluon's binding energy. Given that the Planck mass is related to the vacuum expectation value of the non-minimally coupled field, we find an extensive region of the parameter space where screening mechanisms create a spatially dependent gravitational constant. We say that the field over-screens when this effect is more significant than the fifth forces suppressed by screening mechanisms, as we illustrate for the chameleon and symmetron models.</description>

      <title>NNLO+PS predictions for Higgs production through bottom-quark fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD corrections for Higgs production through bottom-quark annihilation (\bbH{}) matched to parton showers (NNLO+PS) using the \minnlo{} technique. The \minnlo{} method is adapted for the extra scale dependence due to the Yukawa coupling renormalized in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme. The computation has been carried out in the five flavour scheme (5FS) neglecting the bottom mass. Results are compared against fixed-order predictions at NNLO and resummed predictions at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. We also present preliminary results within the four-flavour scheme (4FS) setup, reaching a new level of precision in the massive scheme.</description>

      <title>Polarized Dipole Scattering Amplitudes meet the Valence Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently revised small-$x$ helicity evolution, resumming the double-logarithmic factor, $\alpha_s\ln^2(1/x)$, allows for the study of helicity distributions of quarks and gluons at small Bjorken $x$, corresponding to high center-of-mass energy. In this work, we calculate the moderate-$x$ initial conditions in the regime, $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)\sim 1$, for the small-$x$ helicity evolution using a light-front valence quark model of the proton, which provides additional physical information about the target. The perturbative emission and absorption of a gluon by the valence quarks are also included. The results, given in Eqs. (35), provide a new set of initial conditions with a significantly reduced number of free parameters than conventional models. Consequently, the predictive power of small-$x$ helicity evolution is expected to improve once the initial conditions from this work are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Observational bounds on a possible electron-to-proton mass ratio variation and constraints in the lepton-specific 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test a possible redshift variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, $\mu = m_e/m_p$, directly from galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements and type Ia Supernovae observations. Our analysis is completely independent of any cosmological model. Our result reveals no variation of $\mu$ within 1 $\sigma$ confidence level. From the point of view of Particle Physics, we can use the precision on these results to constrain the parameter space of models beyond the Standard Model of electroweak interactions. We exemplify this by focusing in a specific Two Higgs Doublet model (2HDM), where the second scalar doublet couples exclusively to leptons. An important parameter in the model concerns the ratio between its vacuum expectation values, defined by $\tan\beta$. In our approach we can constrain the inverse parameter (cot$\beta$) to an optimal value, (tan$\beta)^{-1}=$ 0.02127 $\pm$ 0.0029, with the largest vacuum expectation value for 2HDM, $v_2$, estimated at around 240.033 $\pm$ 0.21~GeV. Also, by taking into account the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy found between theory and experiment, we can reduce the validity region for this model and establish bounds on the scalar masses, in the light of our findings from galaxy clusters data for $\mu$. This study contributes valuable insights to the understanding of Particle Physics and Astrophysics interface, establishing a new interplay between data from large scale structure of the Universe and subatomic Physics.</description>

      <title>Solving recurrence relations for multiloop integrals in the limit of large values of the dimensional regularization parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for calculating the $1/d$ expansion coefficients for solutions of the integration by parts relations for Feynman integrals is presented. The idea is to use linear substitutions to transform these relations to an explicitly recursive form. The possibility of such a transformation is demonstrated for several families of massless (with one massive line) vacuum integrals up to the 7-loop level.</description>

      <title>Disentangling SMEFT and UV contributions in $h\to Z\gamma$ and $h\to\gamma\gamma$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LHC searches have revealed that the Higgs boson decay to a photon pair is nearly consistent with the Standard Model (SM), whereas recently, there is evidence for the decay of the Higgs boson to a $Z$-boson and a photon. These decays are governed by the same set of Wilson-coefficients at the tree level in Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). In this study, we aim to explain this potential discrepancy between the decays $h\to \gamma \gamma$ and $h\to Z\gamma$. We conduct a model-independent analysis in SMEFT to determine the magnitude and features of the Wilson coefficients required to account for the observed distinction between the two signal strengths. Following this, we adopt a top-down approach, considering all single and two field extensions of the SM, including scalars and fermions, as candidates for new interactions. We perform the matching of these models to one loop using automated packages and compare the models' predictions regarding $h\to Z\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the low-$p_{\rm T}$ pion excess in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and top RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bayesian inference analysis is performed to quantify the pion excess in the low transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) regime in heavy-ion collisions. This quantification is conducted across centrality classes and collision systems at the LHC and top RHIC energy. The analysis is based on the relativistic fluid dynamics description of $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of identified charged hadrons. A $p_{\rm T}$ range scan investigation to determine the optimal range for the pion $p_{\rm T}$ spectra with respect to a fluid dynamic description is performed, finding 0.5~$&lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; $~2.0~GeV$/c$. A significant low-$p_{\rm T}$ pion excess is computed across all centrality classes and collision systems investigated, indicating that a clear low-$p_{\rm T}$ component arises from different physics mechanisms, rather than thermal production. Further comparison with measurements by the PHOBOS Collaboration confirms the persistence of the pion excess into very low-$p_{\rm T}$, with no enhancement observed in kaons and protons within the current experimental precision.</description>

      <title>SU(3) symmetry analysis in charmed baryon two body decays with penguin diagram contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of experimental measurements from the BESIII, Belle, and Belle-II collaborations encourage investigations into charmed baryon two-body decay processes. By including contributions from the penguin diagrams that are ignored in previous studies, we perform a global analysis with SU(3) flavor symmetry. Assuming all form factors are real, we achieve a remarkable minimal $\chi^{2}/d.o.f = 0.788$ and find that the contribution of the amplitude proportional to $V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ is of the order $\sim 0.01$, comparable with the contribution of the tree-level diagram. Additionally, by using the KPW theorem to reduce the number of amplitudes from 13 to 7 in the leading contribution, it becomes possible to consider the complex form factor case for the leading IRA amplitude in the global analysis. However, the analysis of complex form factors significantly conflicts with the experimental data $Br(\Xi_c^0\to\Xi^-\pi^+)$, and by excluding this data, $\chi^2/d.o.f$ is reduced from 5.95 to 1.19. Although the analysis of complex form factors shows a significant central value of the penguin diagram contribution, the large errors from the corresponding form factors make it a challenge to precisely determine its true contribution. Consequently, the direct CP violation in decay processes is predicted to be approximately zero. With more data in future experiments, the penguin diagram contribution with the amplitude proportional to $V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ will be precisely determined, allowing for a more accurate prediction of CP violation. Our analysis necessitates further theoretical investigations and experimental measurements in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings, I review recent precision calculations relevant for the LHC, all related to the electroweak, Higgs or top sector of the Standard Model. These applications range from triboson production to the production of a top-antitop pair in association with a W boson and to Higgs production in association with another Higgs boson, a top-antitop pair or a W boson. These proceedings reflect a presentation given at DIS2024 and provide a snapshot of the current frontier for theoretical predictions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Finding flavon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the flavour phenomenology and collider signatures of flavon of $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M}$ flavour symmetries for the soft symmetry-breaking scenario and a new symmetry-conserving mechanism at the high-luminosity LHC, high energy LHC, and a 100 TeV hadron collider. The flavour physics of quark and leptonic observables places different bounds on the parameter space of flavons of $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M}$ flavour symmetries. On the collider side, the decay $t \rightarrow c a$ can be probed by the high-luminosity LHC, high energy LHC, and a 100 TeV hadron collider for the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm 8} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm 22}$ flavour symmetry. The inclusive production signatures can be used to probe the flavon of all the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M} $ flavour symmetries for the soft symmetry-breaking scenario for a heavy flavon at a 100 TeV collider. Flavons of all the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M} $ flavour symmetries can be probed at high energy LHC and a 100 TeV collider for a low mass in the case of soft symmetry-breaking. The di-flavon production is within reach of the high-luminosity LHC, high energy LHC, and a 100 TeV collider only for a light flavon. The 14 TeV high-luminosity LHC can probe only the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm 2} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm 5}$ and $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm 8} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm 22}$ flavour symmetries for a few specific inclusive signatures. The symmetry-conserving scenario remains beyond the detection capabilities of any collider.</description>

      <title>All order factorization for virtual Compton scattering at next-to-leading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss all-order factorization for the virtual Compton process at next-to-leading power (NLP) in the $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/Q$ and $\sqrt{-t}/Q$ expansion (twist-3), both in the double-deeply-virtual case and the single-deeply-virtual case. We use the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) as the main theoretical tool. We conclude that collinear factorization holds in the double-deeply virtual case, where both photons are far off-shell. The agreement is found with the known results for the hard matching coefficients at leading order $\alpha_s^0$, and we can therefore connect the traditional approach with SCET. In the single-deeply-virtual case, commonly called deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS), the contribution of non-target collinear regions complicates the factorization. These include momentum modes collinear to the real photon and ultrasoft interactions between the photon-collinear and target-collinear modes. Indeed, we identify a potentially problematic non-perturbative contribution, which might violate the universality of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at NLP accuracy.</description>

      <title>Novel structures and collapse of solitons in nonminimally gravitating dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter simulations predict Bose-Einstein condensations with short-range correlation, known as solitons or boson stars, at the centers of dark matter halos. This paper investigates the formation and collapse of dark matter solitons influenced by nonminimal gravitational effects, characterized by gradient-dependent self-interactions of dark matter and an additional source in Poisson's equation for gravity. Our simulations suggest that the initial evolution of dark matter resembles that without nonminimal gravitational effects. However, regions with negative mass density may develop, and solitons will collapse when their densities reach certain critical values for both positive and negative coupling constants. With strong nonminimal coupling, structure growth could be significantly enhanced.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda\, l^+\nu_\ell$ weak decay including new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda \ell^{+} \nu_\ell$ decay with a focus on potential new physics (NP) effects in the $\ell = \mu$ channel. We employ an effective Hamiltonian within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to consider generalized dimension-6 semileptonic $c\to s$ operators of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor types. We rely on Lattice QCD (LQCD) for the hadronic transition form factors, using heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) to determine those that have not yet been obtained on the lattice. Uncertainties due to the truncation of the NP Hamiltonian and different implementations of HQSS are taken into account. As a result, we unravel the NP discovery potential of the $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda$ semileptonic decay in different observables. Our findings indicate high sensitivity to NP in lepton flavour universality ratios, probing multi-TeV scales in some cases. On the theoretical side, we identify LQCD uncertainties in axial and vector form factors as critical for improving NP sensitivity, alongside better SMEFT uncertainty estimations.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to Higgs boson production and $H \to b \bar{b}$ decay in weak boson fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study QCD corrections to the process where a Higgs boson is produced in weak boson fusion and then decays into a pair of massive $b$ quarks. We find that typical experimental criteria used to identify $b$ jets in this process affect QCD corrections to the decay, making it necessary to account for them in the proper description of this process. Indeed, if corrections to the production and decay are combined, the fiducial cross section of the weak boson fusion process $p p \to H(\to b \bar{b}) j j$ is reduced by about $40\%$ relative to leading-order predictions, compared to just about $8\%$ if only corrections to the production process are considered. We investigate the origin of these large corrections through next-to-next-to-leading-order and conclude that they appear because a number of independent moderately-large effects conspire to significantly reduce the fiducial cross section for this process.</description>

      <title>On-shell Renormalization with Vector-like Leptons, One-loop Muon-Higgs Coupling and Muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models with vector-like leptons can strongly modify the lepton mass generation mechanism and lead to correlated effects in lepton-Higgs couplings and lepton dipole moments. Here we begin an analysis of higher-order corrections in such models by setting up a renormalization scheme with full on-shell conditions on the lepton self energies, masses and fields. A minimal set of fundamental parameters is renormalized in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme. We provide a detailed discussion of lepton mixing and redundancies at higher orders, show how the relevant counterterms can be obtained from the renormalization conditions, and determine the $\beta$-functions corresponding to the scheme. As a first application we calculate the one-loop effective muon--Higgs coupling and analyse its correlation with the muon anomalous magnetic moment $\Delta a_\mu^{\text{VLL}}$. In the interesting case of large masses and opposite-sign coupling, the lowest-order correlation implies a fixed value of $\Delta a_\mu^{\text{VLL}}$ around $22.5\times 10^{-10}$, while the higher-order corrections significantly reduce this value to the interval $(10...18)\times 10^{-10}$.</description>

      <title>Collider Tests of Flavored Resonant Leptogenesis in the $U(1)_X$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generation of baryon asymmetry through the flavored resonant leptogenesis in the $U(1)_X$ extension of the Standard Model. Being a generalization of the $U(1)_{B\text{-}L}$, $U(1)_X$ is an ultraviolet-complete model of the right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), whose CP violating out-of-equilibrium decays lead to the generation of baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. We can also explain the neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism in this model. We consider three different cases for different $U(1)_X$ charges of the scalar particle responsible for $U(1)_X$ breaking at TeV-scale. These include the popular $U(1)_{B\text{-}L}$ and $U(1)_{R}$ models, as well as a $U(1)_C$ model which maximizes the collider signal. We numerically solve the flavored Boltzmann transport equations to calculate the total baryon asymmetry. We show that all three cases considered here can naturally explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe in a large portion of the available parameter space, while satisfying the neutrino oscillation data. We find that the $U(1)_C$ case offers successful leptogenesis in a larger portion of the parameter space as compared to $U(1)_{B\text{-}L}$ and $U(1)_{R}$. We also perform a comparative study between the flavored and unflavored leptogenesis parameter space. Finally, we also study the collider prospects for all these scenarios using the lepton number violating signal of $pp\to \ell^\pm \ell^\pm+$jets mediated by the $Z'$ boson associated with $U(1)_X$. We find that HL-LHC may be able to probe a small portion of the relevant parameter space having successful leptogenesis, if neutrinos have normal mass ordering, while a $\sqrt s=100$ TeV future collider can access a much larger region of the parameter space, thereby offering an opportunity to test resonant leptogenesis in the $U(1)_X$ model.</description>

      <title>Induced Domain Walls of QCD Axion, and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that heavy axion domain walls induce domain walls of the QCD axion through a mixing between the heavy axion and the QCD axion, even when the pre-inflationary initial condition is assumed for the QCD axion. The induced domain walls arise because the effective $\theta$ parameter changes across the heavy axion domain walls, shifting the potential minimum of the QCD axion. When the heavy axion domain walls collapse, the induced QCD axion domain walls collapse as well. This novel mechanism for producing the QCD axions can explain dark matter even with the axion decay constant as small as ${\cal O}(10^{9})$ GeV. In particular, this scenario requires domain wall collapse near the QCD crossover, potentially accounting for the stochastic gravitational wave background suggested by recent pulsar timing array observations, including NANOGrav. Using this mechanism, it is also possible to easily create induced domain walls for string axions or axions with a large decay constant, which would otherwise be challenging. We also comment on the implications for cosmic birefringence using induced axion domain walls.</description>

      <title>TCC in the interior of moduli space and its implications for the string landscape and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions that describe a universe undergoing a transition from an accelerating expansion phase in the past to an eternal decelerating expansion phase in the future, driven by a scalar field evolving in a potential energy landscape. We show that any solution for which the accelerating phase violates the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), even in the interior of moduli space, never approaches the asymptotic vacuum with zero particles. Based on the assumption that the effective field theory must be valid for the vacuum on the asymptotic boundary, as motivated by holography and string theory, we argue that (multi-field) scalar potentials with such solutions are disallowed, thus strengthening the case for TCC. In particular, the results imply a new set of complex and highly-nonlinear constraints across the entire string landscape which may make realizing inflation impossible.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>String Geometry Theory and The String Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is a candidate of the non-perturvative formulation of string theory. In this theory, strings constitute not only particles but also the space-time. In this review, we identify perturbative vacua, and derive the path-integrals of all order perturbative strings on the corresponding string backgrounds by considering the fluctuations around the vacua. On the other hand, the most dominant part of the path-integral of string geometry theory is the zeroth order part in the fluctuation of the action, which is obtained by substituting the perturbative vacua to the action. This part is identified with the effective potential of the string backgrounds and obtained explicitly. The global minimum of the potential is the string vacuum. The urgent problem is to find the global minimum. We introduce both analytical and numerical methods to solve it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binder-cumulant analysis of the critical point in the heavy-quark region of QCD is performed by Monte-Carlo simulations with the hopping-parameter expansion at $N_t=6$. We extend our previous analysis at $N_t=4$ to finer lattices and perform high-precision analyses on large spatial volumes up to the aspect ratio $LT=N_s/N_t=18$. Higher order terms in the hopping-parameter expansion are incorporated effectively up to 14th order. The numerical results show that the violation of the finite-size scaling becomes more prominent on the finer lattice at a given aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Understanding the approach to thermalization from the eigenspectrum of non-Abelian gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of SU(3) gauge theory with and without dynamical quarks (QCD) at thermal equilibrium using lattice gauge theory techniques. By measuring eigenstates of a massless overlap Dirac operator on the gauge configurations, we provide a gauge invariant method to study spectral properties of non-Abelian gauge theories. Whereas the majority of these eigenstates below the magnetic scale have universal nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations consistent with certain class of random matrix theories at temperatures away from the chiral crossover transition in QCD, a few among them start to become prominent just above the crossover forming clusters percolating over the entire volume. By matching the non-perturbative magnetic scales in a high temperature thermal state and a particular non-equilibrium chaotic state of QCD, we provide an estimate of thermalization time $\sim 1.44$ fm/c.</description>

      <title>Strangeness-Correlations on the pseudo-critical line in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present some lattice QCD results on first ($\chi_1^i$) and second ($\chi_2^i$) cumulants of and correlations ($\chi_{11}^{ij}$) among net baryon-number ($B$), strangeness ($S$) and electric charge ($Q$) along the pseudo-critical line ($T_{pc}(\mu_B)$) in the temperature ($T$)--baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) phase diagram of (2+1)-flavor QCD. We point out that violations of the isospin symmetric limit of vanishing electric charge chemical potential are small along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ for the entire range of $\mu_B$ covered in the RHIC beam energy scan. For the strangeness neutral matter produced in heavy-ion collisions this leads to a close relation between $\chi_{11}^{BS}$ and $\chi_{11}^{QS}$. We compare lattice QCD results for $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ line with preliminary experimental measurements of $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ for collision energies $7.7~{\rm GeV}\le \sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\le 62.4~{\rm GeV}$. While we find good agreements for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\ge 39$~GeV, differences are sizeable at smaller values of $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$. Moreover, we compare lattice QCD results for the ratio of the strangeness ($\mu_S$) to baryon ($\mu_B$) chemical potentials, which define a strangeness neutral system with fixed electric charge to baryon number density, with experimental results obtained by the STAR collaboration for $\mu_S/\mu_B$ using strange baryon yields on the freeze-out line. Finally, we determine the baryon chemical potential at the freeze-out ($\mu_B^f$) by comparing $\chi_1^B/\chi_2^B$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ with the experimentally measured net-proton cumulants $\chi_1^p/\chi_2^p$. We find that $\{\mu_B^f, T_{pc}(\mu_B^f) \}$ are consistent with the freeze-out parameters of the statistical-model fits to experimentally measured hadron yields for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} \geq 11.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Longer-Lived Mediators from Charged Mesons and Photons at Neutrino Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since many of the dark-sector particles interact with Standard Model (SM) particles in multiple ways, they can appear in experimental facilities where SM particles appear in abundance. In this study, we explore a particular class of longer-lived mediators that are produced from photons, charged mesons, neutral mesons, and $e^\pm$ that arise in proton-beam fixed-target-type neutrino experiments. This class of mediators encompasses light scalars that appear in theories like extended Higgs sectors, muon(electro)philic scalars, etc. We evaluate the sensitivities of these mediators at beam-based neutrino experiments such as the finished ArgoNeuT, ongoing MicroBooNE, SBND, ICARUS, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. We realize that scalars are more enhanced while produced from three-body decay of charged mesons, especially if they are muonphilic in nature. For scenarios that contain muonphilic scalars, these experiments can probe unexplored regions of parameter space that can explain the current discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of muons. The sensitivity of electrophilic scalars at the DUNE Near Detector can explore new regions. We also show that Bethe-Heitler scattering processes can be used to probe flavor-specific lepton final states even for the mediator masses below twice the lepton mass.</description>

      <title>When a complementarity in the neutrino and the quark mixing meets a parameter symmetry and its implications to the unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complementarity that addresses relationships among the parameters in the neutrino and the quark mixing matrix, use it to estimate the size of the uncertainty among the elements in the matrix and address its implications to the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix and Wolfenstein parameterization and the tension in the first row. First, we describe how a complementarity with a phase being introduced as an extra parameter can be held in the nine independent schemes of parameterizing the matrix introducing a discrete parameter symmetry within a certain size of uncertainty and how it can be related to a combination of sine functions. With that, for the first time, we describe a method that we can use to constrain the size of the uncertainty associated with the parameters, not the central values, complementing that among the diagonal elements in the neutrino mixing matrix. Then we do the same for the quark sector and discuss its implication in the relation to the size of the uncertainty among the elements. Seeing that our estimation is larger than that was reported by running the global fit in the quark sector, our result could be an indication that we may need to be cautious when addressing the tension in the first row of the matrix in the quark sector and when running global fit to constrain the size of the uncertainty, where Wolfenstein parameterization, one that is not unitarity guaranteed, is used, as opposed to the combination of the three rotational matrix. Given that the size of the uncertainty for the individual diagonal element in the second and the third row, our result also could be an indication that we may need to wait until the size of uncertainty for the second and the third row goes down further before addressing the tension. It could be an opening of considering the possibility of a mixing between the neutrino and the quark sector too.</description>

We calculate the rate of electron excitation resulting from the Migdal effect and observe a substantial coherent enhancement compared to ordinary neutrino-electron scattering. Furthermore, we provide numerical sensitivities for detecting the Migdal effect and constraints on the neutrino magnetic moment, utilizing an experimental setup with reactor neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Dark matter production accompanied by gravitational wave signals during cosmological phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature-dependent production of feebly interacting massive dark matter particle (FIMP DM) within a $Z_2$ model, incorporating two $Z_2$-odd scalar fields. In specific parameter regions, three distinct mechanisms individually dominate the production of the FIMP DM. These mechanisms include the semi-production process, commonly known as the ``exponential growth'' process, the production from pair annihilations of the bath particles, and the three-body decay process. It is crucial to consider the thermal history during the evolution of FIMPs, as it involves multiple phase transitions occurring prior to the freeze-in of dark matter. Consequently, the scalar masses experience thermal variations, leading to a distinctive evolutionary trajectory for FIMPs when compared to scenarios without accounting for the thermal effects. Notably, the unique pattern of FIMP evolution is accompanied by the production of gravitational waves, presenting promising opportunities for detection using forthcoming interferometers.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm to Parallelise Parton Showers on a GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) paradigm of GPU programming does not support the branching nature of a parton shower algorithm by definition. However, modern GPUs are designed to schedule threads with diverging processes independently, allowing them to handle such branches. With regular thread synchronisation and careful treatment of the individual steps, one can simulate a parton shower on a GPU. We present a Sudakov veto algorithm designed to simulate parton branching on multiple events in parallel. We also release a CUDA C++ program that generates matrix elements, showers partons and computes jet rates and event shapes for LEP at 91.2 GeV on a GPU. To benchmark its performance, we also provide a near-identical C++ program designed to simulate events serially on a CPU. While the consequences of branching are not absent, we demonstrate that a GPU can provide the throughput of a many-core CPU. As an example, we show that the time taken to shower 10^6 events on one NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPU is equivalent to that of 295 Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPU cores.</description>

      <title>Open charm tetraquarks in broken SU(3)_F symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompted by a recent lattice QCD calculation, we review the SU(3) light quark flavor structure of charmed tetraquarks with spin-0 diquarks. Fermi statistics forces the three light quarks to be in the representation 3*x3*= 3+6*. This agrees with the weak repulsion in the 15 of the 3x8 in Dbar K scattering studied on the lattice. We analyze the 3+6* multiplet broken by the strange quark mass and determine the five independent masses from the known masses of diquarks. The mass of D^* _{s0}(2317) is predicted within 50 MeV accuracy. The recently observed D_s^{--}(2900) and D_s^{0}(2900), likely part of a I=1 multiplet, with flavor composition c* q* q' s and X_0(2900), an isosinglet with flavor composition c*s* ud, fit naturally in a 3+6* structure as the first radial excitations. We discuss also the decay modes of D^* _{s0}(2317), of the radial excitations and of the predicted particles.</description>

      <title>Factorization of photon induced processes in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-Collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the influence of initial photons polarization and recoil effects from final state soft photons.</description>

      <title>Unregulated Divergences of Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman integrals can be expanded asymptotically with respect to some small parameters at the integrand level, a technique known as the expansion by regions. A naive expansion by regions may break down due to divergences not regulated by the spacetime dimension, exemplified by the rapidity divergences. A criterion to identify unregulated divergences is provided in this article. The analysis is conducted using both parametric and Mellin-Barnes representations, leading to a consistent conclusion. Based on this analysis, it is proven that the presence of unregulated divergences implies the degeneracies of regions, which may help to explain phenomena like the collinear anomaly.</description>

      <title>Refinable modeling for unbinned SMEFT analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present techniques for estimating the effects of systematic uncertainties in unbinned data analyses at the LHC. Our primary focus is constraining the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT), but the methodology applies to broader parametric models of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). We elevate the well-established procedures for binned Poisson counting experiments to the unbinned case by utilizing machine-learned surrogates of the likelihood ratio. This approach can be applied to various theoretical, modeling, and experimental uncertainties. By establishing a common statistical framework for BSM and systematic effects, we lay the groundwork for future unbinned analyses at the LHC. Additionally, we introduce a novel tree-boosting algorithm capable of learning highly accurate parameterizations of systematic effects. This algorithm extends the existing toolkit with a versatile and robust alternative. We demonstrate our approach using the example of an SMEFT interpretation of highly energetic top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Ab initio investigation of the $^7$Li($p,e^+e^-$)$^8$Be process and the X17 boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of anomalies in the electron-positron angular correlations in high-energy decays in $^4$He, $^8$Be, and $^{12}$C have been reported recently by the ATOMKI collaboration. These could be explained by the creation and subsequent decay of a new boson with a mass of ${\sim}17$ MeV. Theoretical understanding of pair creation in the proton capture reactions used in these experiments is important for the interpretation of the anomalies. We apply the ab initio No-Core Shell Model with Continuum (NCSMC) to the proton capture on $^7$Li. The NCSMC describes both bound and unbound states in light nuclei in a unified way with chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions as the only input. We investigate the structure of $^8$Be, the $p+^7$Li elastic scattering, the $^7$Li($p,\gamma$)$^8$Be cross section and the internal pair creation $^7$Li($p,e^+ e^-$)$^8$Be. We discuss the impact of a proper treatment of the initial scattering state on the electron-positron angular correlation spectrum and compare our results to available ATOMKI data sets. Finally, we calculate $^7$Li($p,X$)$^8$Be cross sections for several proposed models of the hypothetical X17 particle.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic particle production scenario in algebraically coupled quintessence field with dark matter fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an algebraically coupled quintessence field with a dark matter fluid, considering a scenario involving non-adiabatic particle production through the action principle by modifying the interaction Lagrangian. The interaction parameter serves as the source of dark matter particles and entropy production. As particle creation occurs due to the interaction between the field and fluid sectors, the system manifests additional pressure. Our analysis includes studying the system's dynamics by considering an exponential type of interaction corresponding to the field's exponential potential. We assess the system's background dynamics using the dynamical system stability technique and obtain the necessary constraints on the model parameters. We also determine the best-fit values of the model parameters against OHD+Pantheon+ data by adopting a data analysis technique and compare the evidence to $\Lambda$CDM. Based on the AIC information criterion, the current model shows strong support; however, the BIC does not show very strong support.</description>

      <title>Accelerating universe at early and late times in extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario that can explain the early-time inflation and the late-time dark energy within a unified framework. A scalar potential combining power-law and exponential type in a context of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity is critically important for this realization. A realistic scenario can be achieved in a two-field model in which one directional motion in field space realizes the slow-roll inflation. The inflaton ends up with oscillatory period and turns its direction to another direction that is identified as the quintessence field, giving rise to the dark energy at late times. The inflaton oscillation is expected to realize efficient heating if parametric amplification works. Along the quintessence direction, the present universe is on the way to reach the asymptotic fixed point. We search for successful parameter region, taking potential function in the form of low-order field powers times decreasing exponential in two dimensional field space.</description>
