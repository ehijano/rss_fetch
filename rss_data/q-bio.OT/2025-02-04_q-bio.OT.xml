      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Bioactive Peptides from Cuminum cyminum L. Seeds: Sequence Identification and Pharmacological Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuminum cyminum L. (cumin) is a medicinal and edible plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating various ailments, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, inflammation, asthma, and diabetes. While previous research has primarily focused on its essential oils, studies on its protein-derived bioactive peptides remain limited. In this study, we employed an innovative extraction method to isolate peptides from cumin seeds for the first time and screened their biological activities, revealing significant antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic properties. Guided by bioactivity, we utilized advanced separation and structural identification techniques, including Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS), to systematically purify and characterize cumin-derived peptides. A total of 479 unique peptide sequences were identified using Mascot software and the SwissProt/UniProt_Bos databases. Among these, 15 highly bioactive peptides were selected for further analysis based on bioactivity and toxicity predictions using PeptideRanker and ToxinPred. Structural characterization revealed key features, such as {\alpha}-helices and \b{eta}-sheets, associated with their multifunctional activities. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of bioactive peptides from Cuminum cyminum L. seeds, elucidating their potential as antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic agents. These findings not only clarify the pharmacological basis of cumin's traditional uses but also lay a theoretical foundation for the development of novel therapeutic agents from this medicinal plant.</description>
