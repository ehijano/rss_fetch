      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>

      <title>The Decision Problem for Regular First-Order Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical `decision problem' asks whether a given formula of first-order logic is satisfiable. In this work we consider an extension of this problem to regular first-order theories, i.e. (infinite) regular sets of formulae. Building on the beautiful classification of syntactic classes as decidable or undecidable for the classical decision problem, we show that some classes (the EPR and Gurevich classes) which are decidable in the classical setting are undecidable for regular theories; on the other hand for each we show a subclass which remains decidable in our setting, leaving a complete classification as a challenge for future work. Finally, we observe that our problem generalises prior work on verification of uninterpreted programs, and give a semantic class of existential formulae for which the problem is decidable.</description>

      <title>Invariants and Home Spaces in Transition Systems and Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This lecture note focuses on comparing the notions of invariance and home spaces in Transition Systems and more particularly, in Petri Nets. We also describe how linear algebra relates to these basic notions in Computer Science, how it can be used for extracting invariant properties from a parallel system described by a Labeled Transition System in general and a Petri Net in particular. We endeavor to regroup a number of algebraic results dispersed throughout the Petri Nets literature with the addition of new results around the notions of semiflows and generating sets. \newline Several extensive examples are given to illustrate how the notion of invariants and home spaces can be methodically utilized through basic arithmetic and algebra to prove behavioral properties of a Petri Net. Some additional thoughts on invariants and home spaces will conclude this note.</description>

      <title>Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic for Branching Bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Labelled transitions systems can be studied in terms of modal logic and in terms of bisimulation. These two notions are connected by Hennessy-Milner theorems, that show that two states are bisimilar precisely when they satisfy the same modal logic formulas. Recently, apartness has been studied as a dual to bisimulation, which also gives rise to a dual version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem: two states are apart precisely when there is a modal formula that distinguishes them.
  In this paper, we introduce "directed" versions of Hennessy-Milner theorems that characterize when the theory of one state is included in the other. For this we introduce "positive modal logics" that only allow a limited use of negation. Furthermore, we introduce directed notions of bisimulation and apartness, and then show that, for this positive modal logic, the theory of $s$ is included in the theory of $t$ precisely when $s$ is directed bisimilar to $t$. Or, in terms of apartness, we show that $s$ is directed apart from $t$ precisely when the theory of $s$ is not included in the theory of $t$. From the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem, the original result follows.
  In particular, we study the case of branching bisimulation and Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until (HMLU) as a modal logic. We introduce "directed branching bisimulation" (and directed branching apartness) and "Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until" (PHMLU) and we show the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorems. In the process, we show that every HMLU formula is equivalent to a Boolean combination of Positive HMLU formulas, which is a very non-trivial result. This gives rise to a sublogic of HMLU that is equally expressive but easier to reason about.</description>
