      <title>RiboDiffusion: Tertiary Structure-based RNA Inverse Folding with Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA design shows growing applications in synthetic biology and therapeutics, driven by the crucial role of RNA in various biological processes. A fundamental challenge is to find functional RNA sequences that satisfy given structural constraints, known as the inverse folding problem. Computational approaches have emerged to address this problem based on secondary structures. However, designing RNA sequences directly from 3D structures is still challenging, due to the scarcity of data, the non-unique structure-sequence mapping, and the flexibility of RNA conformation. In this study, we propose RiboDiffusion, a generative diffusion model for RNA inverse folding that can learn the conditional distribution of RNA sequences given 3D backbone structures. Our model consists of a graph neural network-based structure module and a Transformer-based sequence module, which iteratively transforms random sequences into desired sequences. By tuning the sampling weight, our model allows for a trade-off between sequence recovery and diversity to explore more candidates. We split test sets based on RNA clustering with different cut-offs for sequence or structure similarity. Our model outperforms baselines in sequence recovery, with an average relative improvement of $11\%$ for sequence similarity splits and $16\%$ for structure similarity splits. Moreover, RiboDiffusion performs consistently well across various RNA length categories and RNA types. We also apply in-silico folding to validate whether the generated sequences can fold into the given 3D RNA backbones. Our method could be a powerful tool for RNA design that explores the vast sequence space and finds novel solutions to 3D structural constraints.</description>

      <title>Tensor Factorisation for Polypharmacy Side Effect Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adverse reactions caused by drug combinations are an increasingly common phenomenon, making their accurate prediction an important challenge in modern medicine. However, the polynomial nature of this problem renders lab-based identification of adverse reactions insufficient. Dozens of computational approaches have therefore been proposed for the task in recent years, with varying degrees of success. One group of methods that has seemingly been under-utilised in this area is tensor factorisation, despite their clear applicability to this type of data. In this work, we apply three such models to a benchmark dataset in order to compare them against established techniques. We find, in contrast to previous reports, that for this task tensor factorisation models are competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network models and we recommend that future work in this field considers cheaper methods with linear complexity before running costly deep learning processes.</description>
