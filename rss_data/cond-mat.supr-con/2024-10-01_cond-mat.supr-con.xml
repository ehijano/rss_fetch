      <title>Buried Dirac points in Quantum Spin Hall Insulators: Implications for edge transport and Majorana Kramer Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge and end states in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistors for Logic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junction field-effect transistors (JJFETs) have recently re-emerged as promising candidates for superconducting computing. For JJFETs to perform Boolean logic operations, the so-called gain factor $\alpha_{R}$ must be larger than 1. In a conventional JJFET made with a classical channel material, due to a gradual dependence of superconducting critical current on the gate bias, $\alpha_{R}$ is much smaller than 1. In this Letter, we propose a new device structure of quantum enhanced JJFETs in a zero-energy-gap InAs/GaSb heterostructure. We demonstrate that, due to an excitonic insulator quantum phase transition in this zero-gap heterostructure, the superconducting critical current displays a sharp transition as a function of gate bias, and the deduced gain factor $\alpha_{R}$ ~ 0.06 is more than 50 times that (~ 0.001) reported in a classical JJFET. Further optimization may allow achieving a gain factor larger than 1 for logic applications.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ferroelectricity and superconductivity in a two-dimensional monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of ferroelectricity (FE) and superconductivity (SC) becomes the frontier of condensed matter research recently especially in the realm of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Identifying a general strategy to realize coexistence of FE and SC in a single material is extremely important for this active field, but quite challenging thus far. We show in this work that coexistence of robust FE and metallicity/SC can be realized by hole-doping a ferroelectric insulator which hosts antibonding highest valence bands (HVB). Using typical 2D ferroelecrtic SnS monolayer as a concrete example, we demonstrate that 0.30 hole/cell doping leads to enhancement of total polarization mainly ascribed to the increasing of polar displacement and ionic polarization. In addition, due to the strong Fermi surface nesting and prominent softening of out-of-plane acoustic phonon upon hole-doping, SnS can be turned into a single gap superconductor with an unexpectedly high transition temperature (Tc) of ~7 K, whereas the polar phonon mode gives negligible contribution to electron-phonon couplings. Our work provides general principle and realistic material for realizing metallic FE and superconducting FE, which paves the way for reversible and nonvolatile superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Noise scaling in SQUID arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the noise scaling in high-Tc commensurate 1D and 2D SQUID arrays. We show that the voltage noise spectral density in 1D arrays violates the scaling rule of ~1/Np for the number Np of Josephson junctions in parallel. In contrast, in 2D arrays with Ns 1D arrays in series, the voltage noise spectral density follows more closely the expected scaling behaviour of ~Ns/Np. Additionally, we reveal how the flux and magnetic field rms noise spectral densities deviate from their expected ~(NsNp)^(-1/2) scaling and discuss their implications for designing low noise magnetometers.</description>

      <title>Doping Dependence of Upper Critical Field of High-Tc Cuprate Bi2+xSr2-xCaCu2O8+d Estimated from Irreversibility Field at Zero Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the temperature (T) dependence of the irreversibility field Hirr(T) in high-critical-temperature cuprate Bi2+xSr2-xCa1-yYyCu2O8+d (Bi-2212) single crystals over a wide range of hole doping level (p). Hirr(T) was evaluated by measuring the magnetization hysteresis loop. The value of Hirr(T) extrapolated to T = 0 K [Hirr(0)], is either equal to or sets the lower boundary for the upper critical field at T = 0 K [Hc2(0)]. Tc shows a parabolic p-dependence (peak at p = 0.16), whereas Hirr(0) increases monotonically with p by approximately one order of magnitude, from 19 T for the most underdoped sample (p = 0.065, Tc = 24 K) to 209 T for the most overdoped sample (p = 0.200, Tc = 75 K). The present results qualitatively agree with Hc2(0) values evaluated from the specific heat measurements. The observed p-dependence of Hirr(0) in Bi-2212 is distinct from those in YBa2Cu3O7-d and HgBa2CuO6+d, in which a pronounced dip structure appears in the underdoped region. Considering that the dip structures observed in these two systems are likely associated with the formation of competing orders (most likely field-induced charge orders), the present results indicate that the influence of the competing order in Bi-2212 is less prominent than that in the other two systems.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance and Type-I Superconductivity in $\beta$-IrSn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered material $\beta$-IrSn$_4$ ($I4_1/acd$, $D^{20}_{4h}$, #142), whose electron bands have symmetry-enforced Dirac points, was investigated using high-quality single crystals. It exhibits a pronounced linear field-dependence of magnetoresistance (LMR), which cannot be explained by currently existing models. Structures in the field-angle dependence of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity are attributable to the Fermi surface topology; the presence of open orbits is inferred. At the superconducting (SC) transition, the specific-heat jump exhibits a significant increase in applied fields, revealing the type-I SC nature. This feature is attributable to the high Fermi velocity of linearly dispersive multibands. To clarify the mechanism of the puzzling LMR, investigations into the topological nature of those multibands in applied fields are highly desired.</description>

      <title>Orbital-FFLO State and Josephson Vortex Lattice Melting in Layered Ising Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of in-plane magnetic fields on the superconducting state in layered Ising superconductors, resulting in the emergence of the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state coupled with Josephson vortices. Recent experiments have revealed an unexpected first-order phase transition in these superconductors under strong in-plane magnetic fields. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this phase transition is primarily driven by the formation and subsequent melting of a Josephson vortex lattice within the superconducting layers. As the magnetic field increases, the vortex lattice undergoes a transition from a solid to a liquid state, triggering the observed first-order phase transition. We calculate both the melting line and the in-plane critical field in the phase diagram, showing strong agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Poor-man's Majorana edge mode enabled by specular Andreev reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D TI) supports a chiral Majorana edge mode at the interface between a superconductor and a magnetic insulator. The complexity of the materials combination is such that this state has not yet been observed. Here we show that a helical Majorana edge mode appears even in the absence of the magnetic insulator, if the Fermi level of the massless surface electrons is at the Dirac point. Specular Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions is at the origin of the effect. The simplified geometry may favor experimental observation of the helical Majorana mode, although it lacks the topological protection of its chiral counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body interactions in metal-organic frameworks are fundamental for emergent quantum physics. Unlike their solution counterpart, magnetization at surfaces in low-dimensional analogues is strongly influenced by magnetic anisotropy induced by the substrate and still not well understood. Here, we use on-surface coordination chemistry to synthesize on Ag(111) and superconducting Pb(111) an iron-based spin chain by using pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone precursors as ligands. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy, we compare their structures and low-energy spin excitations of coordinated Fe atoms with high S = 2 spin-state. Although the chain and coordination centers are identical on both substrates, the long-range spin-spin coupling due to a superexchange through the ligand observed on Ag is absent on Pb(111). We ascribe this reduction of spin-spin interactions on Pb to the depletion of electronic states around the Fermi level in the Pb(111) superconductor as compared to silver.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of linear-in-temperature scattering rate in three-orbital Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental demonstration of the doping dependence of the linear-in-temperature resistivity coefficient in cuprates, we numerically investigated the three-orbital Emery model focusing on the slope of the $T$-linear electronic and quasiparticle scattering rates by adopting dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our exploration discovered that the slope of electronic scattering rate evolves linearly with the electron-doping; while it is inversely proportional to the hole-doping level at intermediate doping regime and then crossovers to the linear-like dependence on further hole doping. These features remarkably match with the experimental findings qualitatively. We further discuss the doping-dependent slope of the quasiparticle scattering rate and also estimate the resistivity coefficient. Our presented work provides promising insight on the three-orbital Emery model, particularly its doping evolution and connection to the underlying mechanism of the $T$-linear resistivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

      <title>Superfluid transition temperature of bond bipolarons with Coulomb interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing an exactly sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo method, we explore the influence of long-range Coulomb interaction on the superfluid transition temperature of bipolarons in a two dimensional square lattice. The model studied here is the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with phonon-modulated electron hopping. Previously, in the absence of long-range Coulomb interaction, this model demonstrated the emergence of small-size, light-mass bipolarons that undergo a superfluid transition at high values of the transition temperature $T_c$ [Physical Review X 13, 011010, (2023)]. Our findings indicate that with the long-range Coulomb interaction, $T_c$ remains relatively high, even in the deep adiabatic regime where the phonon frequency $\omega/t = 0.5$ and the Coulomb interaction $V = U/10$. This result suggests a relatively high superfluid transition temperature for bond bipolarons with long range Coulomb interaction in the low-density regime, which could provide a new insights for the future experiments on dilute superconductors.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive investigations concerning its paring mechanism and a correct description of its effective low-energy physics. Notable experimental observations include the right-triangle-shaped superconducting dome with the maximum $T_c$ of about 80 K and the strange metal behavior in the normal state above $T_c$. Here we apply the Schwinger boson approach to the bilayer $t$-$V$-$J$ model, which allows us to treat well both the magnetic correlations and the superconducting instability. We obtain a global phase diagram with both metallic and superconducting ground states separated by a quantum phase transition, and predict a minimal interlayer superexchange $J$ and a minimal $d_{z^2}$-hole concentration necessary for the superconductivity, with a highly asymmetric right-triangle-like shape for the $T_c$ curve as well as a maximum $T_c$ comparable with experiments. The normal state is featured with a pseudogap in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ spectra associated with preformed Cooper pairs and non-Fermi liquid strange metal behavior due to hybridization-induced spinon-holon-electron scattering. Our work clarifies the key difference of the two-component scenario of the superconductivity from other mechanisms, and provides a consistent understanding of the high-temperature superconductivity and strange metallic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric superfluid weight in multiband superconductors: A microscopic interpretation</title>

Abstract: Even in non-interacting limit, electrons on different Bloch bands of a multiband system do not move as if they are oblivious to the presence of one another. Instead, they move in concert by virtue of a non-Abelian interband Berry connection. While the impact of this quantum geometric attribute manifests most famously through the Hall response of topological bands, the geometric effects in superconductors have attracted significant recent attention. In particular, much has been discussed about the quantum-metric-induced superfluid weight (SW) in flatband superconductors. In this study, we revisit the geometric SW in generic multiband superconductors and trace its origin to a series of microscopic processes. We separately derive the SW of models containing only intraband Cooper pairing and those involving interband pairing. Two classes of processes enabled by the so-called interband velocity (or the closely related interband Berry connection) are identified: one resembles the transfer of Cooper pairs between different bands, and the other corresponds to virtual single-electron back-and-forth tunneling between the bands. The former contribution manifests as effective Josephson coupling between the multiband superconducting order parameters, while the latter constitutes the only source of SW for a superconducting flatband well isolated from other bands. We further numerically evaluate the SW of a simple two-band superconductor with trivial band topology, showcasing how the geometric contribution is sensitive to the details of the multiband pairing configuration. In particular, we highlight an intriguing scenario of negative SW, which may pave way for the formation of novel pair density wave order. Our study provides deeper and more intuitive insight into the origin and nature of the SW induced by the quantum geometry of paired Bloch states.</description>
