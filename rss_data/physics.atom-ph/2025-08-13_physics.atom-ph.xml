      <title>Production and spectroscopy of cold radioactive molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules with heavy, radioactive nuclei promise extreme sensitivity to fundamental nuclear and particle physics. However, these nuclei are available in limited quantities, which challenges their use in precision measurements. Here we demonstrate the gas-phase synthesis, cryogenic cooling, and high-resolution laser spectroscopy of radium monohydroxide, monodeuteroxide, and monofluoride molecules ($^{226}$RaOH, $^{226}$RaOD, and $^{226}$RaF) in a tabletop apparatus by combining novel radioactive target production protocols, optically driven chemistry in a cryogenic buffer gas, and low-background spectroscopic detection methods. The molecules are cooled in the lab frame, creating conditions that are the same starting points as many current molecular precision measurement and quantum information experiments. This approach is readily applied to a wide range of species and establishes key capabilities for molecular quantum sensing of exotic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Wigner representation enables the exact derivation of the atom interferometer phase, unlike the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact expression for the phase of an atomic interferometer located in a non-inertial reference frame (platform) moving along an arbitrary trajectory and with an orientation that changes arbitrarily over time is obtained. This expression takes into account precisely gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, and gravity-gradient forces, which arise during the rotation of the gravity source at a permanent rate. To achieve this result, we utilized the equations for the atomic density matrix in the Wigner representation. Starting from the exact formula, we derived three new terms in the well-known limit of small rotation angles and short interrogation time, which are attributed to the rotation and translational motion of the platform.</description>

      <title>Probing spin-motion coupling of two Rydberg atoms by a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol to measure the state-dependent motion of Rydberg atoms induced by dipole-dipole interactions. Our setup enables simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</description>

      <title>Rigorous quantum calculations for atom-molecule chemical reactions in electric fields: from single to multiple partial wave regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for rigorous quantum calculations of cross sections for atom-molecule reactive scattering in the presence of a dc electric field. The wavefunction of the reaction complex is expanded in an overcomplete set of arrangement-dependent Fock-Delves hyperspherical basis functions and the interactions of the reactants and products with electric fields are accounted for in the total angular momentum representation. A significant computational challenge affecting our previously developed approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{115}$, 023201 (2015)] is addressed by an efficient asymptotic frame transformation between the hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates in the presence of an external field. Using accurate {\it ab initio} potential energy surfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical reactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$ $\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field strength. The field dependence of the cross sections for the LiF + H chemical reaction exhibits resonance structure mediated by tunneling-driven interactions between reactants and products. No significant field effects are found for the F + HD $\to$ HF + D, DF + H chemical reaction at 1 Kelvin, even for state-resolved transitions and with field magnitudes reaching 200 kV/cm. Our calculations illustrate the essential role of basis set convergence for the proper interpretation of external field effects on chemical reaction dynamics. While reduced-basis calculations for the F + HD reaction indicate significant effects of electric fields on product state distributions, these effects vanish when the number of total angular momentum basis states is increased.</description>

      <title>Effects of finite trapping on the decay, recoil, and decoherence of dark states of quantum emitter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective interaction of electronic excitations with the electromagnetic field in atomic arrays can lead to reduced decay rates, forming subradiant states with applications in quantum information and memories. By including quantized vibrational excitations, we examine the effects of finite trap strength and light-mediated forces on highly subradiant singly-excited states for two, three, and many atoms in a 1D waveguide or free space. For waveguide-coupled and tightly trapped atoms, the recoil energy from photon emission can reach a vibrational quantum, even in the Lamb-Dicke regime. For weakly trapped atoms, the vibrational wavepackets are shifted or distorted due to induced forces and uneven decay. These effects lead to a time-dependent decay rate, extra vibrational energy transfer, and mixing of different electronic and vibrational states. The resulting entanglement entropy and infidelity can be mitigated by decreasing the induced forces or increasing trap strength. For quantum information storage, these findings suggest optimal array configurations in geometry and polarization. Our results provide insights for quantum memories and atom array experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of polarisation on two-photon resonance in a large Zeeman manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present numerical investigations on a large Zeeman manifold in an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) medium, focusing on the D1 and D2 lines of 87 Rb as our model system. We examine two distinct models comprising 13 and 16 energy levels, respectively, using pump-probe spectroscopy with varying polarization of the light fields. A longitudinal magnetic field is used, and the ellipticity of both light fields is varied with the constraint that both lights have orthogonal polarization. We discover that in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field, the change in ellipticity of light polarization induces optical anisotropy. This anisotropy results from the uneven distribution of population among the ground Zeeman levels, leading to the absorption of weak probe light. For a large number of states interacting with different field components, the existence of a steady state depends upon the multi-photon resonance and phase matching conditions. A comment is made on why such conditions are not required in our model, and the assumptions and limitations of the model are also discussed. To validate our numerical findings, we perform experimental measurements at two different magnetic field strengths in the D2 line of 87 Rb. The experimental results align well with our numerical simulations. Specifically, we conclude that the probe transmission spectra at lower magnetic field values (up to 20 G) exhibit similarity for both the D1 and D2 lines of 87 Rb, effectively described by the 13-level model. However, at higher magnetic field values, a more complicated 16-level (or higher) system is necessary to accurately capture the response of the probe in D2 line.</description>

      <title>Exact perturbative expansion of the transport coefficients of a normal low-temperature Fermi gas with contact interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity. The inclusion of the correction linear in $k_{\rm F}a$ greatly improves the agreement with the recent measurement of the viscosity by the Yale group.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>
