      <title>Increased antimicrobial activity of ZnO nanoparticle thin films: Effect of surface structuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the antimicrobial efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) films with varying microstructure, crystallographic orientation and surface roughness.  Thin films with different microstructures were obtained by varying precursor concentrations (0.1 M, 0.25 M, and 0.4 M) and solvent types (Ethanol, Propanol, and Butanol). The characterization of the films by X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed films with varying degrees of orientation along the c-axis, which increased with the concentration of the precursor and with the decrease in the carbon chain length of the alcohol. Raman spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of a hexagonal wurtzite ZnO. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dense and homogeneous films with a thickness of 93 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed changes in surface irregularity and an increase in surface roughness with the carbon length of solvent and a maximum roughness at a precursor concentration of 0.25 M in propanol. The antimicrobial activity was assessed following ISO 22196:2011 standards with few modifications. Results indicated that ZnO NPs films with rougher surfaces reduced coli (gram(-)), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram(-)) and Staphylococcus aureus (gram(+) ) bacteria populations due to an increase of contact surface between NPs with bacteria. Their effectiveness against Candida albicans was moderate, with a maximum reduction of 0.72 Log10 CFU/cm$^2$ with rougher film.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic uniform 2D moir\'e superlattices with controllable angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices, engineered through precise stacking of van der Waals (vdW) layers, hold immense promise for exploring strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, these applications have been held back by the common preparation method: tear-and-stack of Scotch tape exfoliated monolayers. It has low efficiency and reproducibility, along with challenges of twist angle inhomogeneity, interfacial contamination, micrometer sizes, and a tendency to untwist at elevated temperatures. Here we report an effective strategy to construct highly consistent vdW moir\'e structures with high production throughput, near-unity yield, pristine interfaces, precisely controlled twist angles, and macroscopic scale (up to centimeters) with enhanced thermal stability. We further demonstrate the versatility across various vdW materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, graphene, and hBN. The expansive size and high quality of moir\'e structures enables high-resolution mapping of the reciprocal space back-folded lattices and moir\'e mini band structures with low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique will have broad applications in both fundamental studies and mass production of twistronic devices.</description>

      <title>Your Clean Graphene is Still Not Clean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts aimed at scaling fabrication processes to the level of single atoms, dubbed atom-by-atom fabrication or atomic fabrication, invariably encounter the obstacle of atomic scale cleanliness. When considering atomic fabrication, cleanliness of the base material and purity of the source reservoir from which atomic structures will be built are invariable constraints imposed by laws of physics and chemistry. As obvious as such statements may be, and regardless of the inevitable consequences for successful atomic fabrication, there is a poignant lack of understanding of the "dirt" (contamination/impurities). Here, we examine hydrocarbon contamination on graphene. Graphene has formed the base substrate for many e-beam-based atomic fabrication studies and many strategies for cleaning graphene have been presented in the literature. One popular method is heating to high temperatures (&gt;500 {\deg}C). It is usually inferred that volatile hydrocarbons evaporate into the microscope vacuum system leaving behind pristine graphene. Here, we show through direct image intensity analysis that what appears to be clean graphene can be coated with a thin layer of dynamically diffusing hydrocarbons. This result holds significant implications for approaches to e-beam based atomic fabrication, updates the conceptual model of e-beam induced hydrocarbon deposition, and may extend to hot surfaces generally.</description>

      <title>Interplay of trimerization, chirality and ferroelecticity in multiferroic BaCoSiO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials combine multiple ferroic orders that may enable cross-functionalities, e.g. control of one ferroic order by the field conjugate to the other one. BaCoSiO$_4$, a recently proposed multiferroic combines multiple unit cell-tripling modes, structural chirality and ferroelectric polarization, whose interactions result in a peculiar ground state. We derive the Landau free energy for interacting trimerization, electric polarization and structural chiral modes and find the corresponding coefficients from first-principles calculations. This results in a quantitative model for the description of domain walls and vortices, observed in recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Electronic Structure of NiPS$_3$ through Synchrotron-Based ARPES and Alkali Metal Dosing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the band structure in NiPS$_3$, a van der Waals layered antiferromagnet, utilizing high-resolution synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and corroborative density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By tuning the parameters of the light source, we obtained a very clear and wide energy range band structure of NiPS$_3$. Comparison with DFT calculations allows for the identification of the orbital character of the observed bands. Our DFT calculations perfectly match the experimental results, and no adaptations were made to the calculations based on the experimental outcomes. The appearance of novel electronic structure upon alkali metal dosing (AMD) were also obtained in this ARPES study. Above valence band maximum, structure of conduction bands and bands from defect states were firstly observed in NiPS$_3$. We provide the direct determination of the band gap of NiPS$_3$ as 1.3 eV from the band structure by AMD. In addition, detailed temperature dependent ARPES spectra were obtained across a range that spans both below and above the N\'eel transition temperature of NiPS$_3$. We found that the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states have almost identical spectra, indicating the highly localized nature of Ni $d$ states.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Short-Range Order in GeSn Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy and Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic short-range order (SRO) in direct-bandgap GeSn for infrared photonics has recently attracted attention due to its notable impact on band structures. However, the SRO in GeSn thin films grown by different methods have hardly been compared. This paper compares SRO in GeSn thin films of similar compositions grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using atom probe tomography. An $\sim$15% stronger preference for Sn-Sn 1$^{st}$ nearest neighbor (1NN) is observed in MBE GeSn than CVD GeSn for both thin film and quantum well samples with Sn composition ranging from 7 to 20%. Interestingly, samples grown by different deposition tools under the same method (either MBE or CVD) showed remarkable consistency in Sn-Sn 1NN SRO, while MBE vs. CVD showed clear differences. Supported by theoretical modeling, we consider that this difference in SRO originates from the impact of surface termination, where MBE surfaces are exposed to ultrahigh vacuum while CVD surfaces are terminated by H to a good extent. This finding not only suggests engineering surface termination or surfactants during the growth as a potential approach to control SRO in GeSn, but also provides insight into the underlying reasons for very different growth temperature between MBE and CVD that directly impact the strain relaxation behavior.</description>

      <title>Identifying Direct Bandgap Silicon Structures with High-throughput Search and Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizations of silicon-based luminescent devices are restricted by the indirect-gap nature of diamond silicon. In this study, the high-throughput method is employed to expedite discoveries of direct-gap silicon crystals. The machine learning (ML) potential is utilized to construct a dataset comprising 2637 silicon allotropes, which is subsequently screened using an ML Hamiltonian model and density functional theory calculations, resulting in identification of 47 direct-gap Si structures. We calculate transition dipole moments (TDM), energies, and phonon bandstructures of these structures to validate their performance. Additionally, we recalculate bandgaps of these structures employing the HSE06 functional. 22 silicon allotropes are identified as potential photovoltaic materials. Among them, the energy per atom of Si22-Pm, which has a direct bandgap of 1.27 eV, is 0.026 eV/atom higher than diamond silicon. Si18-C2/m, which has a direct bandgap of 0.796 eV, exhibits the highest TDM among identified structures. Si16-P21/c, which has a direct bandgap of 0.907 eV, has the mass density of 2.316 g/cm3, which is the highest among identified structures and higher than that of diamond silicon. The structure Si12-P1, which possesses a direct bandgap of 1.69 eV, exhibits the highest spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) among identified structures at 32.28%, surpassing that of diamond silicon. This study offers insights into properties of silicon crystals while presenting a systematic high-throughput method for material discovery.</description>

      <title>Origin of Interstitial Doping Induced Coercive Field Reduction in Ferroelectric Hafnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnia-based ferroelectrics hold promise for nonvolatile ferroelectric memory devices. However, the high coercive field required for polarization switching remains a prime obstacle to their practical applications. A notable reduction in coercive field has been achieved in ferroelectric Hf(Zr)$_{1+x}$O$_2$ films with interstitial Hf(Zr) dopants [Science 381, 558 (2023)], suggesting a less-explored strategy for coercive field optimization. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate the $Pca2_1$ phase, with a moderate concentration of interstitial Hf dopants, serves as a minimal model to explain the experimental observations, rather than the originally assumed rhombohedral phase. Large-scale deep potential molecular dynamics simulations suggest that interstitial defects promote the polarization reversal by facilitating $Pbcn$-like mobile 180$^\circ$ domain walls. A simple pre-poling treatment could reduce the switching field to less than 1 MV/cm and enable switching on a subnanosecond timescale. High-throughput calculations reveal a negative correlation between the switching barrier and dopant size and identify a few promising interstitial dopants for coercive field reduction.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Carrier Transport and Interfacial Recombination at Perovskite-Transport Layer Interfaces Using Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In perovskite solar cells, photovoltaic action is created by charge transport layers (CTLs) either side of the light-absorbing metal halide perovskite semiconductor. Hence, the rates for desirable charge extraction and unwanted interfacial recombination at the perovskite-CTL interfaces play a critical role for device efficiency. Here, the electrical properties of perovskite-CTL bilayer heterostructures are obtained using ultrafast THz and optical studies of the charge carrier dynamics after pulsed photoexcitation, combined with a physical model of charge carrier transport that includes the prominent Coulombic forces that arise after selective charge extraction into a CTL, and cross-interfacial recombination. The charge extraction velocity at the interface and the ambipolar diffusion coefficient within the perovskite are determined from the experimental decay profiles for heterostructures with three of the highest performing CTLs, namely C$_{60}$, PCBM and Spiro-OMeTAD. Definitive targets for the further improvement of devices are deduced: fullerenes deliver fast electron extraction, but suffer from a large rate constant for cross-interface recombination or hole extraction. Conversely, Spiro-OMeTAD exhibits slow hole extraction but does not increase the perovskite's surface recombination rate, likely contributing to its success in solar cell devices.</description>

      <title>Designing Superionic Conductors Using Tetrahedrally Packed Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advanced energy storage solutions, the crystal structure of ionic conductors plays a pivotal role in facilitating ion transport. The conventional structural design principle that compounds with the body-centered cubic (BCC) anionic frameworks have high ionic conductivity is well known. We have extended the conventional design principle by uncovering that many of the anionic frameworks of Ag-ion conductors are characterized by tetrahedrally packed (TP) structures. Leveraging our findings, we have virtually screened TP framework compounds, uncovering their intrinsic potential for superior ionic conductivity through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our design principle is applicable to Ag$^+$ and other mobile ions, including Li$^+$ and F$^-$. We proposed the Met2Ion method to generate ionic crystal structures using metal crystal structures as templates and demonstrated that new ionic conductors with TP frameworks can be discovered. This work paves the way for the discovery and development of next-generation energy storage materials with enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Nesting Driving the RKKY Interaction in the Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Magnet Gd2PdSi3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic skyrmions generated in a centrosymmetric crystal were recently first discovered in Gd2PdSi3. In light of this, we observe the electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and unveil its direct relationship with the magnetism in this compound. The Fermi surface and band dispersions are demonstrated to have a good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried out with careful consideration of the crystal superstructure. Most importantly, we find that the three-dimensional Fermi surface has extended nesting which matches well the q-vector of the magnetic order detected by recent scattering measurements. The consistency we find among ARPES, DFT, and the scattering measurements suggests the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction involving itinerant electrons to be the formation mechanism of skyrmions in Gd2PdSi3.</description>

      <title>Simulating anharmonic crystals: Lights and shadows of first-principles approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Two powerful methodologies have emerged as frontrunners in this exploration: the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) with its counterpart, Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked, and the absence of a formal derivation for the TDEP has led to significant missteps that hamper its predictive accuracy.
  Here, the theoretical foundations of both SCHA and TDEP are revised, unveiling their profound interconnection. This work introduces formal derivation for TDEP, dispelling misconceptions about how to improve its accuracy and refining best practices. The perturbative limit of these methods uncovers that both SCHA and TDEP fall short in reproducing the lowest-order perturbative free energy. While TDEP excels in providing an exact treatment of the static susceptibility, its dynamical extension violates the perturbative regime by overcounting anharmonicity. Conversely, SCHA delivers an approximate static susceptibility but maintains correct static and dynamic response functions within the perturbative limit.
  This work introduces a corrective strategy for TDEP's dynamical extension to address these shortcomings. All the claims provided here are benchmarked against the exact (numerical) solution on a simple one-dimensional anharmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Magnetic nutation induced by anisotropic RKKY interaction in magnetic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system with both charge and spin degrees of freedom, such as a magnetic semiconductor, composed of two subsystems: 1) a gas of noninteracting conduction electrons and 2/ a ferromagnet of localized spins, the two being coupled by the Vonsovskii (sd) local interaction. The whole system is subjected to external electrical and magnetic disturbances. Using the Feynman-Schwinger approach to integrate out the faster (Grassmann) charge degrees of freedom associated with the conduction electrons, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the localized spins. The effective field responsible for the conduction-band splitting induces an anisotropic effective exchange coupling in the form of an XXZ spin model. As an application of this general formalism, we study the dynamics of the net magnetic moment of the effective spin model and show that the anisotropy of the exchange coupling leads to a nutational motion of the magnetization with much higher frequencies (GHz-THz) than the usual precession, which is also modified by the same token. We have derived analytical expressions for the modified precession and low-lying nonuniform modes and compared them with numerical simulations for the effective spin model. We have shown that the frequency (amplitude) of the nutation modes decreases (increases) with the band-splitting field. Further characterization of this phenomenon in magnetic semiconductors should open up new routes for new control in spin-based electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a candidate with unique advantages in the cultivation of solid-state nuclear clock material, Th:SrF2 crystal. It not only has a segregation coefficient close to 1, which can achieve highly efficient and uniform doping of Th, but also ensures a high transmittance (~69% at 150 nm) while achieving extremely high doping concentration (232Th&gt;6*10^20 cm^(-3). In addition, SrF2 crystal will not be irradiated-colored under strong {\alpha} radiation like CaF2 crystal, Th:SrF2 crystal is expected to fully unleash its high concentration doping characteristics while ensuring its transmission performance in nuclear transition band not be severely affected by 229Th radiation damage.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a novel frontier in metallurgical advancements, offering exceptional mechanical properties owing to their unique multicomponent nature. This study explores a novel strategy utilising commodity powders - Ni625, Invar36, and CoCrF75 - to tailor HEAs via metal injection moulding (MIM). The objective is to achieve cost-effective manufacturing while maintaining desired properties. The research involves mixing these powders in a specific proportion, integrating them with a sustainable polyethylene glycol-cellulose acetate butyrate binder system, and characterising the resulting feedstocks for MIM processing. Subsequent debinding and sintering steps were executed to densify and form a single face-centered cubic (FCC) phase HEA, followed by comprehensive analyses to evaluate the suitability of the developed HEA compositions. In addition, all MIM stages were thoroughly characterised to control the porosity of the final parts and to ensure a single FCC solid solution with promising mechanical properties in the developed non-equiatomic CoCrFeNiMox-type HEAs.</description>

      <title>Controlling Plasmonic Catalysis via Strong Coupling with Electromagnetic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic excitations decay within femtoseconds, leaving non-thermal (often referred to as "hot") charge carriers behind that can be injected into molecular structures to trigger chemical reactions that are otherwise out of reach -- a process known as plasmonic catalysis. In this Letter, we demonstrate that strong coupling between resonator structures and plasmonic nanoparticles can be used to control the spectral overlap between the plasmonic excitation energy and the charge injection energy into nearby molecules. Our atomistic description couples real-time density-functional theory self-consistently to Maxwell's equations via the radiation-reaction potential. Control over the resonator provides then an additional knob for non-intrusively enhancing plasmonic catalysis and dynamically reacting to deterioration of the catalyst -- a new facet of modern catalysis.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Engineering of Magnetic Anisotropy from Anomalous Hall Effect in Synthetic SrRuO3 Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in atomically thin correlated heterostructures is essential for exploring quantum magnetic phases for next-generation spintronics. Whereas previous studies have mostly focused on van der Waals systems, here, we investigate the impact of dimensionality of epitaxially-grown correlated oxides down to the monolayer limit on structural, magnetic, and orbital anisotropies. By designing oxide superlattices with a correlated ferromagnetic SrRuO3 and nonmagnetic SrTiO3 layers, we observed modulated ferromagnetic behavior with the change of the SrRuO3 thickness. Especially, for three-unit-cell-thick layers, we observe a significant 1,500% improvement of coercive field in the anomalous Hall effect, which cannot be solely attributed to the dimensional crossover in ferromagnetism. The atomic-scale heterostructures further reveal the systematic modulation of anisotropy for the lattice structure and orbital hybridization, explaining the enhanced magnetic anisotropy. Our findings provide valuable insights into engineering the anisotropic hybridization of synthetic magnetic crystals, offering a tunable spin order for various applications.</description>

      <title>Picosecond lifetimes of hydrogen bonds in the halide perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structures and properties of organic-inorganic perovskites are influenced by the hydrogen bonding between the organic cations and the inorganic octahedral networks. This study explores the dynamics of hydrogen bonds in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$ across a temperature range from 70 K to 350 K, using molecular dynamics simulations with machine-learning force fields. The results indicate that the lifetime of hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing temperature from 7.6 ps (70 K) to 0.16 ps (350 K), exhibiting Arrhenius-type behaviour. The geometric conditions for hydrogen bonding, which include bond lengths and angles, maintain consistency across the full temperature range. The relevance of hydrogen bonds for the vibrational states of the material is also evidenced through a detailed analysis of the vibrational power spectra, demonstrating their significant effect on the physical properties for this class of perovskites.</description>

      <title>Improvement of the perovskite photodiodes performance via advanced interface engineering with polymer dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskite-based photodiodes are promising for efficient detection across a broad spectral range. Perovskite absorber thin-films have a microcrystalline morphology, characterized by a high density of surface states and defects at inter-grain interfaces. In this work, we used dielectric-ferroelectric poly(vinylidene-fluoride-trifluoroethylene-P(VDF-TrFE) to modify the bulk interfaces and electron transport junction in p-i-n perovskite photodiodes. Our complex work demonstrates that interface engineering with P(VDF-TrFE) induces significant Fermi level pinning, reducing from 4.85 eV for intrinsic perovskite to 4.28 eV for the configuration with dielectric interlayers. The integration of P(VDF-TrFE) into the perovskite film did not affect the morphology and crystal structure, but significantly changed the charge transport and device performance. IV curve analysis and 2-diode model calculations showed enhanced shunt properties, a decreased non-ideality factor, and reduced saturation dark current. We have shown that the complex introduction of P(VDF-TrFE) into the absorbers bulk and on its surface is essential to reduce the impact of the trapping processes. For P(VDF-TrFE) containing devices, we increased the specific detectivity from 10^11 to 10^12 Jones, expanded the linear dynamic range up to 100 dB, and reduced the equivalent noise power to 10^-13 W*Hz^-0.5. Reducing non-radiative recombination contributions significantly enhanced device performance, improving rise/fall times from 6.3/10.9 us to 4.6/6.5 us. The cut-off frequency (3dB) increased from 64.8 kHz to 74.8 kHz following the introduction of the dielectric. These results provide new insights into the use of organic dielectrics and an improved understanding of trap-states and ion defect compensation for detectors based on perovskite heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Insulator-to-Metal Transition and Isotropic Gigantic Magnetoresistance in Layered Magnetic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotransport, the response of electrical conduction to external magnetic field, acts as an important tool to reveal fundamental concepts behind exotic phenomena and plays a key role in enabling spintronic applications. Magnetotransport is generally sensitive to magnetic field orientations. In contrast, efficient and isotropic modulation of electronic transport, which is useful in technology applications such as omnidirectional sensing, is rarely seen, especially for pristine crystals. Here we propose a strategy to realize extremely strong modulation of electron conduction by magnetic field which is independent of field direction. GdPS, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor with resistivity anisotropies, supports a field-driven insulator-to-metal transition with a paradoxically isotropic gigantic negative magnetoresistance insensitive to magnetic field orientations. This isotropic magnetoresistance originates from the combined effects of a near-zero spin-orbit coupling of Gd3+-based half-filling f-electron system and the strong on-site f-d exchange coupling in Gd atoms. Our results not only provide a novel material system with extraordinary magnetotransport that offers a missing block for antiferromagnet-based ultrafast and efficient spintronic devices, but also demonstrate the key ingredients for designing magnetic materials with desired transport properties for advanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Thermal and mechanical properties and the structural phase transition under pressure in $A$In$_2$As$_2$ ($A$ = Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental results that BaIn2As2 and Ca(Sr)In2As2, which are the same class of alkali metal compounds, belong to different structural phases have puzzled the current materials physics community. Here, we investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition of AIn2As2 and its accompanying improvement in mechanical and thermal properties. Firstly, the structural stability of the materials and their structural phase transitions under pressure are characterized by enthalpy and double checking by phonon dispersion spectrum. We also confirm the structural phase transitions of the hexagonal and monoclinic phases from a group-theoretic point of view, associating their symmetry operations using transformation matrices. In terms of mechanical properties, we propose an effective scheme for pressure modulation of the anisotropy of AIn2As2 materials and to induce the transformation of AIn2As2 from isotropic to anisotropic (hexagonal) and from brittle to ductile (hexagonal and monoclinic). Meanwhile, we find the negative Poisson's ratio phenomenon under compression and tension, which is favorable for a wide range of applications of this series of materials in aerospace, medicine, sensors, etc. In terms of thermal properties, applying pressure will enhance the structural phase transition temperature of AIn2As2 materials to near room temperature. We further give direct evidence of phonon softening based on group velocity calculations and reveal that phonon softening prevents the heat capacity from reaching the Dulong-Petit limit. Our study provides a theoretical basis for selecting stable structural phases and pioneering thermodynamic property studies of the thermoelectric topological candidate material AIn2As2.</description>

Abstract: The manipulation of mechanical waves is a long-standing challenge for scientists and engineers, as numerous devices require their control. The current forefront of research in the control of classical waves has emerged from a seemingly unrelated field, namely, non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. By drawing analogies between this theory and those of classical systems, researchers have discovered phenomena that defy conventional intuition and have exploited them to control light, sound, and elastic waves. Here, we provide a brief perspective on recent developments, challenges and intricacies that distinguish non-Hermitian elastodynamics from optics and acoustics. We close this perspective with an outlook on potential directions such as topological phases in non-Hermitian elastodynamics and broken Hermitian symmetry in materials with electromomentum couplings.</description>

      <title>Supercell Wannier functions and faithful low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a minimal low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene and related rhombohedral graphene multilayers at low electronic densities by constructing Wannier orbitals defined in real-space supercells of the original primitive cell. Starting from an ab-initio electronic structure theory comprising the atomic carbon $p_z$-orbitals, momentum locality of the Fermi surface pockets around $K,K'$ is circumvented by backfolding the $\pi$-bands to the concomitant mini-Brillouin zone of the supercell, reminiscent of their (twisted) moir\'e counterparts. The supercell Wannier functions reproduce the spectral weight and Berry curvature of the microscopic model and offer an intuitive real-space picture of the emergent physics at low electronic densities being shaped by flavor-polarized wave packets with mesoscopic extent. By projecting an orbital-resolved, dual-gated Coulomb interaction to the effective Wannier basis, we find that the low-energy physics of Bernal bilayer graphene is governed by weak electron-electron interactions. Our study bridges between existing continuum theories and ab-initio studies of small Fermi pocket systems like rhombohedral graphene stacks by providing a symmetric lattice description of their low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Growth of Rutile GeO$_2$ via MOCVD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rutile Germanium Dioxide (r-GeO$_2$) has been identified as an ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor recently, featuring a bandgap of 4.68 eV, comparable to Ga$_2$O$_3$ but offering bipolar dopability, higher electron mobility, higher thermal conductivity, and higher Baliga's figure of merit (BFOM).These superior properties position GeO$_2$ as a promising material for various semiconductor applications. However, the epitaxial growth of r-GeO$_2$, particularly in its most advantageous rutile polymorph, is still at an early stage. This work explores the growth of r-GeO$_2$ using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on an r-TiO$_2$ (001) substrate, utilizing tetraethyl germane (TEGe) as the precursor. Our investigations reveal that higher growth temperatures significantly enhance crystalline quality, achieving a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.181 degree at 925 degree C, compared to 0.54 degree at 840 degree C and amorphous structures at 725 degree C. Additionally, we found that longer growth durations increase surface roughness due to the formation of faceted crystals. Meanwhile, adjusting the susceptor rotation speed from 300 RPM to 170 RPM plays a crucial role in optimizing crystalline quality, effectively reducing surface roughness by approximately 15 times. This study offers a foundational guide for optimizing MOCVD growth conditions of r-GeO$_2$ films, emphasizing the crucial need for precise control over deposition temperature and rotation speed to enhance adatom mobility and effectively minimize the boundary layer thickness.</description>

Abstract: Interfacing the quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a conventional superconductor is known to be a promising manner for realizing a topological superconductor, which has been continuously pursued for years. Such a proximity route depends to a great extent on the control of the delicate interfacial coupling of the two constituents. However, a recent experiment reported the failure to reproduce such a topological superconductor, which is ascribed to the negligence of the electrical short by the superconductor in the theoretical proposal. Here, we reproduce this topological superconductor with attention to the interface control. The resulted conductance matrix under a wide magnetic field range agrees with the fingerprint of this topological superconductor. This allows us to develop a phase diagram that unveils three regions parameterized by various coupling limits, which not only supports the feasibility to fabricate the topological superconductor by proximity but also fully explains the origin of the previous debate. The present work provides a comprehensible guide on fabricating the topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>GW effects on the topology of type-II Dirac cones in NiTe$_2$, PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body correlations are known to be responsible for a broad range of fascinating physical phenomena, introducing corrections that appear elusive at the mean-field level. An example of this is the Lifshitz transition that occurs as the Fermi surface topology changes when {\it e.g.} Coulomb interaction effects break into the picture. In particular, the Fermi velocity renormalization can lead a type-II Weyl semimetal at mean-field level to become a trivial or a type-I Dirac material when correlations are accounted for, which is far from being obvious. In this work we scrutinize the band structure of NiTe$_2$, a material that features a type-II Dirac point near the Fermi level within the mean-field approach. Including GW-level correlations, our findings showcase anisotropic corrections on the Dirac carrier velocity exceeding $100 \, \%$ enhancements, underscoring the nuanced influence of electronic interactions in the band structure. We also consider type-II Dirac crossings in PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$ and observe that including many-body effects via GW the band topology changes, featuring trivial topology and type-I Dirac crossings, respectively. Our findings highlights the necessity to evaluate the many-body effects on non-trivial bands, contributing essential insights to the broader exploration of many-body correlation effects in type-II Dirac points of condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling heterogeneity and disorder during ultrafast surface melting of orbital order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how light modifies long-range order is key to improve our ability to control material functionality on an ultrafast timescale. Transient spatial heterogeneity has been proposed in many materials, but isolating the dynamics of different regions experimentally has been challenging. Here we address this issue and measure the dynamics of orbital order melting in the layered manganite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4, and isolate the surface dynamics from the bulk for the first time. Bulk measurements show orbital order is rapidly suppressed, but the correlation length surprisingly increases. However, the surface dynamics, show a stronger suppression and a significant decrease in correlation length. By isolating the surface changes, we find that light preferentially melts a less ordered surface and the loss of long-range order is likely driven by the formation of local and disordered polarons. Melting the disordered surface effectively increases the average correlation of the bulk probed volume, resolving the contradictory response. These results show that surface scattering methods are necessary to understand both surface and bulk dynamics in heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of band connectivity is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. Here, we develop a new method for analyzing band connectivity, which completely solves the outstanding questions of the reducibility and decomposition of band complexes. By translating the symmetry conditions into a set of band balance equations, we show that all possible band structure solutions can be described by a positive affine monoid structure, which has a unique minimal set of generators, called Hilbert basis. We show that Hilbert basis completely determine whether a band complex is reducible and how it can be decomposed. The band complexes corresponding to Hilbert basis vectors, termed as Hilbert band complexes (HBCs), can be regarded as elementary building blocks of band structures. We develop algorithms to construct HBCs, analyze their graph features, and merge them into large complexes. We find some interesting examples, such as HBCs corresponding to complete bipartite graphs, and complexes which can grow without bound by successively merging a HBC.</description>

Abstract: Multiple anomalous features in electronic spectra of metals with kagome lattice structure -- van Hove singularities, Dirac points, and flat bands -- imply that materials containing this structural motif may lie at a nexus of topological and correlated electron physics. Due to the prospects of such exceptional electronic behavior, the recent discovery of superconductivity coexisting with charge-density wave (CDW) order in the layered kagome metals AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) has attracted considerable attention. Notably, these kagome metals express unconventional magnetotransport behavior, including a linear-in-H diagonal resistivity at low fields, and an even more peculiar, nonmonotonic sign-changing behavior of the Hall resistivity, which has been speculated to arise from a chiral CDW. We argue here that this unusual magnetotransport derives not from such unconventional phenomena, but rather from the unique fermiology of the AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ materials. Specifically, it is caused by a large, concave hexagonal Fermi surface sheet formed in the close proximity to the van Hove singularities, which is backfolded into a small hexagonal sheet and two large triangular sheets in the CDW state. We introduce a model of the electronic structure of these Fermi surface sheets that allows for a full analytical treatment within Boltzmann kinetic theory and that enables semi-quantitative fits of our transport data. Specifically, we find that the anomalous magnetotransport behavior is caused by the confluence of strong reduction of the Fermi velocity near the van Hove singularities located near the vertices of the hexagonal sheet and sharp corners in Fermi surface generated by the CDW reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Streaming Large-Scale Electron Microscopy Data to a Supercomputing Facility</title>

Abstract: Data management is a critical component of modern experimental workflows. As data generation rates increase, transferring data from acquisition servers to processing servers via conventional file-based methods is becoming increasingly impractical. The 4D Camera at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) generates data at a nominal rate of 480 Gbit/s (87,000 frames/s) producing a 700 GB dataset in fifteen seconds. To address the challenges associated with storing and processing such quantities of data, we developed a streaming workflow that utilizes a high-speed network to connect the 4D Camera's data acquisition (DAQ) system to supercomputing nodes at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), bypassing intermediate file storage entirely. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our streaming pipeline in a production setting through an hour-long experiment that generated over 10 TB of raw data, yielding high-quality datasets suitable for advanced analyses. Additionally, we compare the efficacy of this streaming workflow against the conventional file-transfer workflow by conducting a post-mortem analysis on historical data from experiments performed by real users. Our findings show that the streaming workflow significantly improves data turnaround time, enables real-time decision-making, and minimizes the potential for human error by eliminating manual user interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Probed by Chiral Excitonic Optical Response of Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically derive the sum rule for the negative first moment of the absorptive optical conductivity with excitonic effects and establish its connection to the quantum weight $K$ and Chern number $C$ of the ground state. Applying this framework, we investigate the excitonic optical response of the Chern insulator at hole filling factor $\nu=1$ in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. A single chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized light of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral exciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions, which cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum shows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to the nearly saturated bound $K \ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our work illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe quantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$.</description>

      <title>`Interaction annealing' to determine effective quantized valence and orbital structure: an illustration with ferro-orbital order in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, the superposition principle of quantum mechanics ensures that, upon absorbing quantum fluctuation, these rich low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbitals structure. Such a powerful and simple description is, however, difficult to access through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, since in terms of bare particles the quantum fluctuation would heavily smear the quantized quantities. To address this difficulty, we propose an `interaction annealing' approach to decipher the dominant valence and orbital structure by suppressing the charge fluctuation through enhancing ionic charging energy. Applying this approach to ferroelectric semi-metal WTe${_2}$ as a demonstration, we identify a dominant ferro-orbital ordered structure with W ion in a $d^2$ spin-0 configuration. The proposed approach is straightforward to implement in standard DFT calculations to grant additional access to essential low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Dynamic Disproportionation in LiNiO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nickelate materials offer diverse functionalities for energy and computing applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_2$) is an archetypal layered nickelate, but the electronic structure of this correlated material is not yet fully understood. Here we investigate the temperature-dependent speciation and spin dynamics of Ni ions in LiNiO$_2$. Our ab initio simulations predict that Ni ions disproportionate into three states, which dynamically interconvert and whose populations vary with temperature. These predictions are verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Ni L$_{3,2}$-edge. Charge-transfer multiplet calculations consistent with disproportionation reproduce all experimental features. Together, our experimental and computational results support a model of dynamic disproportionation that explains diverse physical observations of LiNiO$_2$, including magnetometry, thermally activated electronic conduction, diffractometry, core-level spectroscopies, and the stability of ubiquitous antisite defects. This unified understanding of the fundamental material properties of LiNiO$_2$ is important for applications of nickelate materials as battery cathodes, catalysts, and superconductors.</description>

Abstract: An analysis of the processes of plastic deformation and acoustic relaxation in a high-entropy alloy Al$_{0.5}$CoCrCuFeNi was carried out. The following have been established: dominant dislocation defects; types of barriers that prevent the movement of dislocations; mechanisms of thermally activated movement of various elements of dislocation lines through barriers at room and low temperatures. Based on modern dislocation theory, quantitative estimates have been obtained for the most important characteristics of dislocations and their interaction with barriers.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Influence of Hydrogen on BCC Iron Grain Boundaries using the Kinetic Activation Relaxation technique (k-ART)</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge in the mechanical integrity of iron and its alloys. This study explores the influence of hydrogen atoms on two distinct grain boundaries (GBs), $\Sigma37$ and $\Sigma3$, in body-centered-cubic (BCC) iron. Using the kinetic activation-relaxation technique (k-ART), an off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo approach, we examine diffusion barriers and mechanisms associated with these GBs. Our findings reveal distinct behaviors of hydrogen in different GB environments, emphasizing the elastic deformation that arises around the GB in the presence of H that leads to either the predominance of new pathways and diffusion routes or a pinning effect of H atoms. We find that, for these systems, while GB is energetically favorable for H, this element diffuses more slowly at the GBs than in the bulk. Moreover, with detailed information about the evolution landscape around GB, we find that the saturation of a GB with hydrogen both stabilizes the GB by shifting barriers associated with Fe diffusion to higher energies and smooths the energy landscape, reducing the number of diffusion events. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of hydrogen's role in GB behavior, contributing valuable insights for the design and optimization of materials in hydrogen-related applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting BN analogue of 8-16-4 graphyne: \textit{In silico} insights into its structural, electronic, optical, and thermal transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boron nitride (BN) analogue of 8-16-4 graphyne, termed SBNyne, is proposed for the first time. Its physical properties were explored using first-principles calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Thermal stability assessments reveal that SBNyne maintains structural integrity up to 1000 K. We found that SBNyne exhibits a wide indirect bandgap of 4.58 eV using HSE06 and 3.20 eV using PBE. It displays strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region while remaining transparent in the infrared and visible regions. Additionally, SBNyne exhibits significantly lower thermal conductivity compared to h-BN. Phonon spectrum analysis indicates that out-of-plane phonons predominantly contribute to the vibrational density of states only at very low frequencies, explaining its low thermal conductivity. These findings expand the knowledge of BN-based 2D materials and open new avenues for their design and advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Dendrites Nucleation in Li Metal Battery by Machine Learning Accelerated Molecular Simulations under Realistic Electrochemical Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncontrollable dendrites growth during electrochemical cycles leads to low Coulombic efficiency and critical safety issues in Li metal batteries. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the dendrite formation mechanism is essential for further enhancing the performance of Li metal batteries. Machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide atomic-scale resolution for various key processes at an ab-initio level accuracy. However, traditional MD simulation tools hardly capture Li electrochemical depositions, due to lack of an electrochemical constant potential (ConstP) condition. In this work, we propose a ConstP approach that combines a machine learning force field with the charge equilibration method to reveal the dynamic process of Li dendrites nucleation at Li metal anode surfaces. Our results show that both dead Li cluster formation and inhomogeneous Li electro-depositions can induce Li dendrites nucleation. We further reveal that the local aggregation of Li atoms in amorphous inorganic components of solid electrolyte interphase is the key factor triggering the nucleation process. Overall, our simulations provide microscopic insights for Li dendrites formations in Li metal anodes. More importantly, we present an efficient and accurate simulation method for modeling realistic ConstP conditions, which holds considerable potential for broader applications in modeling of complex electrochemical interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are important devices for a range of emerging technologies, but most existing compact models capture only their mean switching rates. Capturing qualitatively accurate analog dynamics of these devices will be important as the technology scales up. Here we present results using a one-dimensional overdamped Langevin equation that captures statistical properties of measured time traces, including voltage histograms, drift and diffusion characteristics as measured with Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and dwell times distributions. While common macrospin models are more physically-motivated magnetic models than the Langevin model, we show that for the device measured here, they capture even fewer of the measured experimental behaviors.</description>

Abstract: In the field of magnonics, which uses magnons, the quanta of spin waves, for energy-efficient data processing, significant progress has been made leveraging the capabilities of the inverse design concept. This approach involves defining a desired functionality and employing a feedback-loop algorithm to optimise the device design. In this study, we present the first experimental demonstration of a reconfigurable, lithography-free, and simulation-free inverse-design device capable of implementing various RF components. The device features a square array of independent direct current loops that generate a complex reconfigurable magnetic medium atop a Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) rectangular film for data processing in the gigahertz range. Showcasing its versatility, the device addresses inverse problems using two algorithms to create RF notch filters and demultiplexers. Additionally, the device holds promise for binary, reservoir, and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating non-wetting fluid invasion in volumetric images of porous materials is of broad interest in applications as diverse as electrochemical devices and CO2 sequestration. Among available methods, image-based algorithms offer much lower computational cost compared to direct numerical simulations. Recent work has extended image-based method to incorporate more physics such as gravity and volume-controlled invasion. The present work combines these two developments to develop an image-based invasion percolation algorithm that incorporates the effect of gravity. Additionally, the presented algorithm was developed using a priority queue algorithm to drastically reduce the computational cost of the simulation. The priority queue-based method was validated against previous image-based methods both with and without the effect of gravity, showing identical results. It was also shown that the new method provides a speedup of 20X over the previous image-based methods. Finally, comparison with experimental results at three Bond numbers showed that the model can predict the real invasion process with a high accuracy with and without gravitational effects.</description>
