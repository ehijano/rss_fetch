      <title>Characterizing the negative triangularity reactor core operating space with integrated modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NT experiments have demonstrated core performance on par with positive triangularity (PT) H-mode without edge-localized modes (ELMs), encouraging further study of an NT reactor core. In this work, we use integrated modeling to scope the operating space around two NT reactor strategies: a high-field, compact fusion pilot plant concept and a low field, high aspect ratio concept. By integrating equilibrium, core transport, and edge ballooning instability models, we establish a range of operating points with less than 50 MW scrape-off layer power and fusion power comparable to positive triangularity (PT) H-mode reactor concepts. Heating and seeded impurities are leveraged to accomplish the same fusion performance and scrape-off layer exhaust power for various pressure edge boundary conditions. Scans over these pressure edge conditions accommodate any current uncertainty of the properties of the NT edge and show that the performance of an NT reactor will be extremely dependent on the edge pressure. The high-field case is found to enable lower scrape-off layer power because it is capable of reaching high fusion powers at a relatively compact size, which allows increased separatrix density without exceeding the Greenwald density limit. An increase in fusion power density is seen at weaker NT. Infinite-n ballooning instability models indicate that an NT reactor core can reach fusion powers comparable to leading PT H-mode reactor concepts while remaining ballooning-stable. Seeded krypton is leveraged to further lower scrape-off layer power since NT does not have a requirement to remain in H-mode. We contextualize the NT reactor operating space by comparing to popular PT H-mode reactor concepts, and find that NT exhibits competitive ELM-free performance with these concepts for a variety of edge conditions while maintaining relatively low scrape-off layer power.</description>

      <title>Biermann-battery driven magnetized collisionless shock precursors in laser produced plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports the first complete observation of magnetized collisionless shock precursors formed through the compression of Biermann-battery magnetic fields in laser produced plasmas. At OMEGA, lasers produce a supersonic CH plasma flow which is magnetized with Biermann-battery magnetic fields. The plasma flow collides with an unmagnetized hydrogen gas jet plasma to create a magnetized shock precursor. The situation where the flowing plasma carries the magnetic field is similar to the Venusian bow shock. Imaging 2$\omega$ Thomson scattering confirms that the interaction is collisionless and shows density and temperature jumps. Proton radiographs have regions of strong deflections and FLASH magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations show the presence of Biermann fields in the Thomson scattering region. Electrons are accelerated to energies of up to 100 keV in a power-law spectrum. OSIRIS particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, initialized with measured parameters, show the formation of a magnetized shock precursor and corroborate the experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Thermo-electron accumulation in light and heavy water during MHz-burst laser ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced water ablation triggers various physical effects, including atom ionization, optical breakdown of the liquid, phase explosion, cavitation, and shockwave propagation. These effects can be further amplified in heavy water by deuterium-deuterium fusion reactions, which require extremely high energy levels. Laser pulses can be grouped in bursts to achieve the necessary energy within the ablation plasma plume. This study aims to compare the ablation plasma glow and thermal effects in light and heavy water under both single-pulse and burst-mode ultrashort laser irradiation. Notably, this research introduces the novel application of burst laser ablation in heavy water for the first time. The ablation was conducted beneath the water surface along a circular, laser-scanned trajectory, with two distinct ablation regimes: burst mode and single-pulse mode, utilizing lenses with varying focal lengths and different pulse durations. Absorption processes and plasma glow were monitored using visible and infrared detectors, a fast silicon detector, and a thermocouple.
  The study revealed that the burst regime in heavy water produced the most intense plasma glow when 1 ps laser pulses were used, with shorter pulses yielding less intense glow and the longest pulses yielding the least. Surprisingly, plasma glow at a lower initial power density of 2.6e13 W/cm2 was four times higher than at a higher power density of 8e13 W/cm2. These findings were compared with existing theories on plasma formation in water by ultrashort laser pulses. The observed increase in pulse-to-pulse plasma glow in burst mode was attributed to thermo-electron accumulation effects. The density of excited and hydrated electrons was calculated using both strong-field ionization and avalanche ionization models. Additionally, the influence of pulse parity on burst ablation glow in heavy water was discussed.</description>

      <title>Formation of high-aspect-ratio nanocavity in LiF crystal using a femtosecond of x-ray FEL pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-picosecond optical laser processing of metals is actively utilized for modification of a heated surface layer. But for deeper modification of different materials a laser in the hard x-ray range is required. Here, we demonstrate that a single 9-keV x-ray pulse from a free-electron laser can form a um-diameter cylindrical cavity with length of ~1 mm in LiF surrounded by shock-transformed material. The plasma-generated shock wave with TPa-level pressure results in damage, melting and polymorphic transformations of any material, including transparent and non-transparent to conventional optical lasers. Moreover, cylindrical shocks can be utilized to obtain a considerable amount of exotic high-pressure polymorphs. Pressure wave propagation in LiF, radial material flow, formation of cracks and voids are analyzed via continuum and atomistic simulations revealing a sequence of processes leading to the final structure with the long cavity. Similar results can be produced with semiconductors and ceramics, which opens a new pathway for development of laser material processing with hard x-ray pulses.</description>

      <title>Emergence of two inertial sub-ranges in solar wind turbulence: dependence on heliospheric distance and solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is highly turbulent, and intermittency effects are observed for fluctuations within the inertial range. By analyzing magnetic field spectra and fourth-order moments, we perform a comparative study of intermittency in different types of solar wind measured during periods of solar minima and a maximum. Using eight fast solar wind intervals measured during solar minima between 0.3 au and 3.16 au, we found a clear signature of two inertial sub-ranges with $f^{-3/2}$ and $f^{-5/3}$ power laws in the magnetic power spectra. The intermittency, measured through the scaling law of the kurtosis of magnetic field fluctuations, further confirms the existence of two different power laws separated by a clear break. A systematic study on the evolution of the said sub-ranges as a function of heliospheric distance shows correlation of the break scale with both the turbulence outer scale and the typical ion scales. During solar maximum, we analyzed five intervals for each of Alfv\'enic fast, Alfv\'enic slow and non-Alfv\'enic slow solar wind. Unlike the case during the solar minima, the two sub-ranges are no longer prominent and the Alfv\'enic slow wind is found to be in an intermediate state of turbulence compared to that of the fast wind and the usual non-Alfv\'enic slow wind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addressing the Department of Energy's April, 2022 announcement of a Bold Decadal Vision for delivering a Fusion Pilot Plant by 2035, associated software tools need to be developed for the integration of real world engineering and supply chain data with advanced science models that are accelerated with Machine Learning. An associated research and development effort has been introduced here with promising early progress on the delivery of a realistic Digital Twin Tokamak that has benefited from accelerated advances by the Princeton University AI Deep Learning innovative near-real-time simulators accompanied by technological capabilities from the NVIDIA Omniverse, an open computing platform for building and operating applications that connect with leading scientific computing visualization software. Working with the CAD files for the GA/DIII-D tokamak including equilibrium evolution as an exemplar tokamak application using Omniverse, the Princeton-NVIDIA collaboration has integrated modern AI/HPC-enabled near-real-time kinetic dynamics to connect and accelerate state-of-the-art, synthetic, HPC simulators to model fusion devices and control systems. The overarching goal is to deliver an interactive scientific digital twin of an advanced MFE tokamak that enables near-real-time simulation workflows built with Omniverse to eventually help open doors to new capabilities for generating clean power for a better future.</description>

      <title>Electron shock drift acceleration at a low-Mach-number, low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock drift acceleration plays an important role in generating high-energy electrons at quasi-perpendicular shocks, but its efficiency in low beta plasmas is questionable. In this article, we perform a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of a low-Mach-number low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock, and find that the electron cyclotron drift instability is unstable at the leading edge of the shock foot, which is excited by the relative drift between the shock-reflected ions and the incident electrons. The electrostatic waves triggered by the electron cyclotron drift instability can scatter and heat the incident electrons, which facilitates them to escape from the shock's loss cone. These electrons are then reflected by the shock and energized by shock drift acceleration. In this way, the acceleration efficiency of shock drift acceleration at low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shocks is highly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Exploring the magnetic and thermal evolution of a coronal jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal jets are the captivating eruptions which are often found in the solar atmosphere, and primarily formed due to magnetic reconnection. Despite their short-lived nature and lower energy compared to many other eruptive events, e.g. flares and coronal mass ejections, they play an important role in heating the corona and accelerating charged particles. However, their generation in the ambience of non-standard flare regime is not fully understood, and warrant a deeper investigation, in terms of their onset, growth, eruption processes, and thermodynamic evolution. Toward this goal, this paper reports the results of a data-constrained three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of an eruptive jet; initialized with a Non-Force-Free-Field (NFFF) extrapolation and carried out in the spirit of Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES). The simulation focuses on the magnetic and dynamical properties of the jet during its onset, and eruption phases, that occurred on February 5, 2015 in an active region NOAA AR12280, associated with a seemingly three-ribbon structure. In order to correlate its thermal evolution with computed energetics, the simulation results are compared with differential emission measurement (DEM) analysis in the vicinity of the jet. Importantly, this combined approach provides an insight to the onset of reconnection in transients in terms of emission and the corresponding electric current profiles from MHD evolutions. The presented study captures the intricate topological dynamics, finds a close correspondence between the magnetic and thermal evolution in and around the jet location. Overall, it enriches the understanding of the thermal evolution due to MHD processes, which is one of the broader aspects to reveal the coronal heating problem.</description>

      <title>Quadrilateral Particle Arrangement within Shocks in a Two-Dimensional Dusty Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic structure within a two-dimensional shock was studied using data from a dusty plasma experiment. A single layer of charged microparticles, levitated in a glow-discharge plasma, was perturbed by an electrically floating wire that was moved at a steady supersonic speed to excite a compressional shock. A rearrangement of particles was observed, from a hexagonal lattice in the preshock into a quadrilateral microstructure within the shock. This quadrilateral structure would not be stable in a monolayer of identical repulsive particles, under equilibrium conditions. Glaser-Clark polygon analysis of the microstructure helped in identifying quadrilaterals. Voronoi analysis was used to characterize the defect fraction behind the shock, as an indication of shock-induced melting.</description>

      <title>Effect of injection conditions on the non-linear behavior of the ECDI and related turbulent transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron-cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) has been proposed as one of the main actors behind the anomalous transport of electrons in Hall plasmas. In this work, we revisit the classical theory of this instability [Forslund et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 25, 1266 (1970)] and perform two-dimensional kinetic simulations under several conditions to analyze the non-linear behavior and the induced transport. Fully-periodic simulations, with conditions faithful to the linear theory are analyzed first. In agreement with existing literature, they show the growth of ECDI modes, ion-wave trapping vortexes and an induced cross-field electron current in early simulation times. However, in contrast with similar works, non-linear saturation is observed and the plasma tends, in the long term, to a new equilibrium with mild oscillations and mild anomalous current. This evolution is consistent to what can be expected from energy conservation. The quenching of the oscillations seem to be highly related with the distortion of ion vortexes in phase space after a long-term interaction with the electrostatic wave. This result suggests that sustained oscillations and turbulent current could thrive if ions are renewed by, e.g., removing and injecting particles through axial boundaries instead of applying periodicity.This second type of simulations shows that injection conditions highly impact the late simulation behavior of ECDI oscillations, where we identify several regimes depending on the value of the ion residence time compared to the characteristic saturation time in the fully periodic case. The intermediate regime, where these two times are close, is the only one providing sustained oscillations and electron transport.</description>

      <title>Tayler Instability Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields $B_\phi$ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of $B_\phi$, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number $Pm\ll 1$ (e.g. the Sun) and $Pm\gg 1$ (e.g. protoneutron stars). The parameter dependence of unstable modes suggests a non-universal scaling of the possible Tayler-Spruit dynamo.</description>

      <title>Force-free wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres: Computational modeling in axisymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfv\'en waves to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves interact in the equatorial region. Alfv\'en waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, Alfv\'en waves convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric Alfv\'en wave crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of 'bouncing' Alfv\'en waves by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long-wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.</description>

Abstract: Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations on large-scale systems play a fundamental role in understanding the complexities of plasma dynamics in fusion devices. Efficient handling and analysis of vast datasets are essential for advancing these simulations. Previously, we addressed this challenge by integrating openPMD with BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo code, streamlining data streaming and storage. This integration not only enhanced data management but also improved write throughput and storage efficiency. In this work, we delve deeper into the impact of BIT1 openPMD BP4 instrumentation, monitoring, and in-situ analysis. Utilizing cutting-edge profiling and monitoring tools such as gprof, CrayPat, Cray Apprentice2, IPM, and Darshan, we dissect BIT1's performance post-integration, shedding light on computation, communication, and I/O operations. Fine-grained instrumentation offers insights into BIT1's runtime behavior, while immediate monitoring aids in understanding system dynamics and resource utilization patterns, facilitating proactive performance optimization. Advanced visualization techniques further enrich our understanding, enabling the optimization of BIT1 simulation workflows aimed at controlling plasma-material interfaces with improved data analysis and visualization at every checkpoint without causing any interruption to the simulation.</description>

Abstract: After leaving the Sun's corona, the solar wind continues to accelerate and cools, but more slowly than expected for a freely expanding adiabatic gas. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecrafts to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, in connection to the presence of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves. Alfv\'en waves are perturbations in the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. Our calculations show the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfv\'en waves is sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.</description>
