      <title>Novel entangled dimer state in the Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL) magnet, with antiferromagnetic intradimer and interdimer Heisenberg exchange, is known to host an antisymmetric singlet ground state when the intradimer exchange is dominant. Rare-earth-based SSL systems with strong spin-orbit coupling offer the opportunity for tuning their magnetic properties by using magnetic anisotropy as a control knob. Here, we present bulk characterization and neutron scattering measurements of the SSL material Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$. We find that the Yb$^{3+}$ ions can be described by an effective spin-1/2 model at low temperatures and the system does not show signs of magnetic order down to 50 mK. The magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron spectroscopy data can be well-described by an isolated dimer model with highly anisotropic exchange that stabilizes a singlet ground state with the symmetric wavefunction up/up - down/down. Our results show that strong spin-orbit coupling can induce novel entangled states of matter on the SSL.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Spin Ice on a Breathing Pyrochlore Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin ice systems represent a prime example of constrained spin systems and exhibit rich low-energy physics. In this study, we explore how introducing a tunable anisotropic spin coupling to the conventional Ising spin ice Hamiltonian on the breathing pyrochlore lattice affects the ground state properties of the system. Significant changes are observed in the ground state structure, reflected in the spin structure factor and in a reduction of residual entropy at low temperatures. We theoretically uncover a rich phase diagram by varying the anisotropy and demonstrate how this modification reduces the ground state degeneracy across different phases. Numerical simulations reveal that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the system either undergoes a crossover into a constrained spin ice manifold, characterized by an entropy density that drops below the Pauling entropy of conventional spin ice, or a phase transition into a symmetry-broken state, depending on the perturbations. Additionally, we compute the spin structure factors for the anisotropic model and compare these results to analytical predictions from a large-$N$ expansion, finding good agreement. This work develops the understanding of spin ice in anisotropic limits, which may be experimentally realized by strain, providing, among others, key signatures in entropy and specific heat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent studies on quantum materials where transition-metal atoms give rise to $d$-bands typical of kagome metals. Using examples from several material families - AV$_3$Sb$_5$, FeGe, RV$_6$Sn$_6$, and LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ - we argue that $p$-bands contributed by elements beyond the kagome network also play a crucial role in the electronic instabilities, including the charge-density-waves and superconductivity in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo assessment of embedding for a strongly-correlated defect: interplay between mean-field and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects are of interest for many applications, from quantum sensing to modifying bulk properties of materials. Because of their localized orbitals, the electronic states are often strongly correlated, which has led to a proliferation of quantum embedding techniques to treat this correlation. In these techniques, a weakly correlated reference such as density functional theory is used to treat most of the one-particle states, while certain states are singled out as an active space to be treated with an effective interaction. We assess these techniques in the context of an iron defect in aluminum nitride by referencing to a fully correlated quantum Monte Carlo description. This comparison allows us to have access to detailed information about the many-body wave functions, which are not available experimentally. We find that errors in the underlying density functional theory calculation, and thus choice of the active space, lead to qualitatively incorrect excited states from the embedded model. These errors are extremely difficult to recover from by adding corrections such as double counting or many-body perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Projectification of point group symmetries with a background flux and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem in two-dimensional spin systems with on-site ${\mathrm U}(1)\rtimes {\mathbb Z}_2$ spin rotation symmetry and point group $C_{2v}$ symmetry about a site. We ``twist" the point group symmetry by introducing a small uniform U(1) flux to obtain a projective symmetry, similarly to the familiar magnetic translation symmetry. The LSM theorem is proved in presence of the flux and then it is demonstrated that the theorem holds also for the flux-free system. Besides, the uniform flux enables us to show the LSM theorem for the time-reversal symmetry and the site-centered $C_2$-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Haldane-Hubbard model: Effective description of an open system with balanced gain and loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the correlated Haldane-Hubbard model with single-particle gain and loss, focusing on its non-Hermitian phase diagram and the ensuing non-unitary dynamic properties. The interplay of interactions and non-hermiticity results in insulating behavior with a phase diagram divided into three distinct regions, exhibiting either topologically gapped or (real) gapless regimes and a trivial phase. The latter is mapped by the emergence of a local order parameter associated with a charge density wave. A ${\cal PT}$-symmetry breaking at the low-lying spectrum occurs when increasing the gain-loss magnitude at a fixed interaction strength, marking the transition from gapped to gapless topological behavior. Further increase leads to the onset of charge ordering in a first-order phase transition in which level crossing takes place in the spectrum's imaginary part. The support that the staggered gain and loss display to robust charge density wave in equilibrium is confirmed in the real-time dynamics in the presence of non-hermiticity, suggesting that engineered gain and loss can be used to tailor an ordered many-body state in experiments.</description>

      <title>Bulk excitations in ultraclean $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$: Quantitative evidence for Majorana dispersions in a Kitaev quantum spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has emerged as a prime candidate for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL), characterized by Majorana quasiparticles, whose edge states exhibit a distinctive half-integer quantized thermal Hall conductivity. However, its van der Waals nature makes its thermal Hall response highly sensitive to structural disorder, leading to sample-dependent variations. Here, we investigate low-energy bulk excitations in the field-induced quantum disordered (FIQD) state of newly available ultraclean single crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. High-resolution specific heat measurements under in-plane magnetic field rotation reveal an anisotropic excitation gap, whose field dependence is consistent with the Majorana gap in the KQSL state. Remarkably, when the field aligns with Ru-Ru bond directions, we observe gapless excitations with Dirac-like dispersions that quantitatively match theoretical predictions of Majorana bands based on the reported Kitaev interactions. Our findings in these ultraclean crystals provide strong evidence that the FIQD state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a robust KQSL, resilient against small disorder perturbations.</description>

      <title>Quasi-local Frustration-Free Free Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that frustration-free models, expressed as sums of finite-range interactions or hoppings, exhibit several properties markedly different from those of frustrated models. In this work, we demonstrate that, by relaxing the finite-range condition to allow for exponentially decaying hoppings, one can build gapped frustration-free systems that realize Chern insulators as well as quasi-degenerate ground states with finite-size splittings. Moreover, by permitting power-law decaying hoppings, we also construct a gapless band metal whose finite-size gap scales inversely with the system size $L$. These findings serve as an important step toward clarifying the general properties of frustration-free systems and those represented by tensor network states.</description>

      <title>Raman spectroscopy of anyons in generic Kitaev spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical probes have emerged as versatile tools for detecting exotic fractionalized phases in quantum materials. We calculate the low-energy Raman response arising from mobile, interacting Ising anyons (or visons) in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid perturbed by symmetry allowed interactions - a phase relevant to \rucl. under a magnetic field. At zero temperature, the two-anyon continuum response shows a leading power-law scaling of the intensity near the onset of the signal: $I(\omega) \sim (\omega-E^0_{2\sigma})^{\frac{1}{8}}$ for linear and parallel-circular polarization channels, where $E^0_{2\sigma}$ is the two-particle gap. Strong corrections due to short-range interactions arise at order $\frac{1}{4}$. For cross-circularly polarized channels, the scaling is given by $I(\omega) \sim (\omega-E^0_{2\sigma})^{|l\pm 1/8|}$, where the value of $l=0,1,2$ is determined by the number of minima in the single anyon dispersion. The exponents are directly related to the topological spin of Ising anyons $\theta_\sigma =\frac{\pi}{8}$, describing their exchange statistics. Our theory generalizes to spectral probes of anyonic quasiparticles with multiple band minima in other quantum liquids. Interaction between anyons may also induce bound-states, resulting in sharp peaks that show strong polarization dependence.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric ferromagnetism by singular saddle point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ferromagnetism that occurs in electrons at a saddle point with band touching, which we call the singular saddle point. At the singular saddle point, the divergent quantum metric induces ferromagnetic correlation, and the logarithmic divergence of the density of states ensures ferromagnetism within Stoner theory. This is a prototypical example of quantum geometric ferromagnetism. The two-dimensional $t_{2g}$-orbital model accommodates the ferromagnetism by this mechanism, which is continuously connected to the exactly proven flat-band ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Towards a critical endpoint in the valence fluctuating Eu(Rh$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_2$Si$_2$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the successful single crystal growth of pure EuRh${_2}$Si${_2}$ and of Eu(Rh$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_2$Si$_2$ with $x\leq0.23$ by the flux method. Through Co substitution, EuRh$_2$Si$_2$ can be tuned from stable antiferromagnetism via a valence-transition state towards the valence-crossover regime. From magnetization measurements, we constructed a $B - T$ phase diagram for EuRh${_2}$Si${_2}$ comprising multiple magnetic phases and showing a sizable magnetic anisotropy within the basal plane of the tetragonal unit cell. This indicates a complex antiferromagnetic ground state for $x=0$. By applying positive chemical pressure through the substitution series Eu(Rh$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_2$Si$_2$, a sharp temperature-induced first-order phase transition is observed in magnetization, resistivity and heat capacity for 0.081 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.119. The critical end point of this valence transition is located in the phase diagram in the vicinity of 0.119 $&lt;x_{\rm EDX}&lt;$ 0.166. At higher substitution level, the system reaches a valence-crossover regime. The obtained results are presented in a temperature-substitition phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Real-space orbital tiling approach for the design of novel superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite substantial advances in the field, we still lack a predictive framework capable of guiding the discovery of new families of superconductors. While momentum-space approaches have advanced the microscopic understanding of superconductivity, they offer limited guidance for materials design based on atomic building blocks. Here, we propose a real-space framework which conceptualizes Cooper pairs as confined standing waves resulting from coherent tilings of atomic orbitals. We call this model the Real-space Orbital Superconducting Pathway (ROSP). Using a tight-binding toy model, we show that the energetics of electron pairing depend on the configuration and overlap of real-space orbitals, which motivates \textit{a priori} design of superconducting families from orbital tiling. We connect the ROSP model to Roald Hoffmann's isolobal analogy to classify families of superconductors based on shared orbital tilings, rather than structure or electron count. As an example, we suggest that superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and LaNiO$_{2}$, despite differing structures and electron counts, may arise from a common ROSP. We introduce a new notation to classify two-dimensional square-net ROSPs and further propose several new families of superconductors on the anti-cuprate lattice. This framework provides a new model for predicting and designing families of high-T$_c$ superconductors from real-space orbital architecture, even without microscopic knowledge of the attractive pairing interaction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-adapted extension of sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) that rigorously embeds space-group symmetry into the many-body subspace sampled by quantum hardware. The method is benchmarked on the two-leg ladder Hubbard model using both molecular orbital and momentum bases. Energy convergence is shown to be improved in the momentum basis compared to the molecular orbital basis for both the spin-quintet ground state and the spin-singlet excited state. We clarify the relationship between the compactness of the many-body wave function and the sparsity of the representation matrices of symmetry operations. Furthermore, the enhancement of the superconducting correlation function due to the Coulomb interaction is demonstrated. Our method highlights the importance of symmetry structure in random-sampling quantum simulation of correlated systems</description>

      <title>Optical properties of a diamond NV color center from capped embedded multiconfigurational correlated wavefunction theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond defects are among the most promising qubits. Modelling their properties through accurate quantum mechanical simulations can further their development into robust units of information. We use the recently developed capped density functional embedding theory (capped-DFET) with the multiconfigurational n-electron valence second-order perturbation theory to characterize the electronic excitation energies for different spin manifolds of the well-characterized negatively charged substitutional N defect adjacent to a vacancy (V$_C$) in diamond (N$_C$V$_C^-$). We successfully reproduce vertical excitation energies for both triplet and singlet states of N$_C$V$_C^-$ with errors &lt; 0.1 eV. Unlike other embedding methods, capped-DFET exhibits robust predictions that are approximately independent of the embedded cluster size: it only requires a cluster to contain the defect atoms and their nearest neighbors (as small as a 40-atom capped cluster). Furthermore, our method is free from slowly converging Coulomb interactions between charged defects, and thus also only weakly dependent on supercell size.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for two-gap superconductivity in hydrogen-intercalated titanium diselenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer an extremely rich material platform in the exploration of unconventional superconductivity. The unconventional aspects include exotic coupling mechanisms such as the Ising pairing, a complex interplay with other electronic orders such as charge-density waves (CDWs), symmetry-breaking and topological effects, and non-trivial gap structures such as multi-gap and possible nodal phases. Among TMDs, titanium diselenide (1$T$-TiSe$_2$) is one of the most studied and debated cases. Hints to an anomalous structure of its superconducting order parameter have emerged over the years, possibly linked to its spatial texturing in real and reciprocal space due to the presence of a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phase, or to a pressure-driven multi-band Fermi surface. However, a direct evidence for a non-trivial structure of the superconducting gap in this material is still lacking. In this work, we bring the first evidence for a two-gap structure in the recently-discovered H-intercalated TiSe$_2$ superconductor (with T$_c \simeq 3.6$ K) by an extensive experimental study that combines magnetotransport measurements, point-contact spectroscopy and scanning tunnel spectroscopy. We show that the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (for $\vec B \parallel c$) as well as the shape of the point-contact and tunneling spectra strongly suggest the existence of two distinct superconducting gaps, and can indeed all be fitted in a self-consistent way with the same gap amplitudes $\Delta_1 = 0.26 \pm 0.12$ meV and $\Delta_2 =0.62 \pm 0.18$ meV.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Interference of Spin-Triplet Superconductors: Application to UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful method to help extract the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by mirror symmetries provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>QCMaquis 4.0: Multi-Purpose Electronic, Vibrational, and Vibronic Structure and Dynamics Calculations with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCMaquis is a quantum chemistry software package for general molecular structure calculations in a matrix product state/matrix product operator formalism of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). It supports a wide range of features for electronic structure, multi-component (pre-Born-Oppenheimer), anharmonic vibrational structure, and vibronic calculations. In addition to the ground and excited state solvers, QCMaquis allows for time propagation of matrix product states based on the tangent-space formulation of time-dependent DMRG. The latest developments include transcorrelated electronic structure calculations, very recent vibrational and vibronic models, and a convenient Python wrapper, facilitating the interface with external libraries. This paper reviews all the new features of QCMaquis and demonstrates them with new results.</description>

      <title>Origin of the classical magnetization discontinuities of the dodecahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the dodecahedron has been shown to have three magnetization discontinuities in an external field. Here it is shown that the highest-field discontinuity can be directly traced back to the strong magnetization jump leading to saturation at the Ising limit, which originates from the magnetic response of an isolated pentagon and the frustrated connectivity of the dodecahedron. This discontinuity survives up to the $XY$ limit and disappears shortly before the ferromagnetic Ising interaction fully polarizes the spins. The two lower-field jumps of the model result from the competition of discontinuities that emerge from the magnetization plateau surviving away from the Ising limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of quantum liquids that are compressible but have vanishing DC conductivity in the absence of disorder. We show that the composite Fermi liquid emerging from strong interaction in a generic Chern band has zero Drude weight, in stark contrast to normal Fermi liquids. Our work establishes the absence of Drude weight as the defining property of the composite Fermi liquid phase, which distinguishes it from the Fermi liquid or other types of non-Fermi liquids. Our findings point to a possibly wide class of gapless quantum phases with unexpected transport and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Truncated Gaussian basis approach for simulating many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Truncated Gaussian Basis Approach (TGBA) for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The approach constructs an effective Hamiltonian within a reduced subspace, spanned by fermionic Gaussian states, and diagonalizes it to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies. Symmetries can be exploited to perform parallel computation, enabling to simulate systems with much larger sizes. As an example, we compute the dynamic structure factor and study quench dynamics in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain, known as ``$E_8$ magnet''. The mass ratios calculated through the dynamic structure factor show excellent agreement with Zamolodchikov's analytical predictions. For quench dynamics we observe that time-evolving wave functions in the truncated subspace facilitates the simulation of long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Layered Multiple Scattering Approach to Hard X-ray Photoelectron Diffraction: Theory and Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoelectron diffraction (PED) is a powerful and essential experimental technique for resolving the structure of surfaces with sub-angstrom resolution. In the high energy regime, researchers in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) observe modulating patterns attributed to X-ray-PED (XPD) effects. This is accompanied by other challenges such as low cross-sections, significant photon momentum transfer, and non-negligible phonon scattering. Overall, XPD is not only an advantageous approach but also exhibits unexpected effects. To disentangle these diffraction influences, we present a PED implementation for the SPRKKR package that utilizes multiple scattering theory and a one-step model in the photoemission process. Unlike real-space implementations of the multiple scattering XPD formalism, we propose a k-space implementation based on the layer KKR method. The main advantage of this method is its ability to address a very broad kinetic energy range (20-8000 eV) without convergence problems related to angular momentum and cluster size. Furthermore, the so-called alloy analogy model can be used to simulate XPD at finite temperatures as well as XPD effects observed in soft and hard X-ray ARPES. For practical applications, we have calculated the circular dichroism in angular distributions (CDAD) associated with core-level photoemission of 2p from Si(100) and 3p from Ge(100). Photoelectrons are excited by hard X-rays (6000 eV) with right and left circularly polarized radiation (RCP and LCP, respectively).</description>

      <title>The Club Sandwich: Gapless Phases and Phase Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework to characterize phase transitions and gapless phases with categorical symmetries. The central tool is the club sandwich, which extends the SymTFT setup to include an interface between two topological orders: there is a symmetry boundary, which is gapped, and a physical boundary that may be gapless, but in addition, there is also a gapped interface in the middle. The club sandwich generalizes so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. Building on the results in [1, 2] on gapped phases with categorical symmetries, we construct gapless theories describing phase transitions with non-invertible symmetries by applying suitable KT transformations on known phase transitions provided by the critical Ising model and the 3-state Potts model. We also describe in detail the order parameters in these gapless theories characterizing the phase transitions, which are generally mixtures of conventional and string-type order parameters mixed together by the action of categorical symmetries. Additionally, removing the physical boundary from the club sandwiches results in club quiches, which characterize all possible gapped boundary phases with (possibly non-invertible) symmetries that can arise on the boundary of a bulk gapped phase. We also provide a mathematical characterization of gapped boundary phases with symmetries as pivotal tensor functors whose targets are pivotal multi-fusion categories.</description>

      <title>From local spin nematicity to altermagnets: Footprints of band topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramer's non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer, and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave, and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting the topology of linear, quadratic and cubic free fermion band dispersions that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$, and $3$ harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a spin-triplet nematic superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in quantum materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and propose spin-disordered alter-valley magnets in these systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian spin Hall insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment reporting the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$, we investigate microscopically the prospects of realizing exotic topologically ordered states beyond conventional quantum Hall physics. We show that a non-Abelian spin Hall insulator, a state of two copies of the non-Abelian Moore-Read state, can be stabilized at half filling of time-reversal conjugate Chern bands. We elucidate that the existence of this phase relies on the reduction of opposite-spin interactions at short distances to overcome the Ising ferromagnetism. Moreover, we demonstrate that band mixing provides a generic mechanism for this reduction to be achieved. Quite remarkably, we find that a renormalization of opposite-spin interactions at short distances as small as 15 % of the moir\'e period is sufficient for a direct transition to a completely spin unpolarized phase which supports the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator. Furthermore, we show that the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator can either break time-reversal symmetry or preserve it depending on the underlying topological order.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Evolution Speed as Indicator of Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In studying the time evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems, a key focus is determining whether the system undergoes relaxation and reaches a steady state at a given point in time. Traditional approaches often rely on specific local operators or a detailed understanding of the stationary state. In this letter, we introduce an alternative method that assesses relaxation directly from the time-dependent state by focusing on the evolution speed of the subsystem. The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the reduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in systems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the evolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably diminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of operators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We apply this approach across various models, including the chaotic Ising chain, XXZ chains with and without many-body localization, and the transverse field Ising chain. Our results confirm the robustness and accuracy of subsystem evolution speed as a reliable indicator for relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to the state of the art. This is obtained by introducing an optimization method that leverages the quadratic dependence of the variational energy on the orbitals of each determinant, enabling an exact iterative optimization, and uses an efficient tensor-contraction algorithm to evaluate the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost that scales as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis.</description>
