      <title>Statistical Patterns in the Equations of Physics and the Emergence of a Meta-Law of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics, as a fundamental science, aims to understand the laws of Nature and describe them in mathematical equations. While the physical reality manifests itself in a wide range of phenomena with varying levels of complexity, the equations that describe them display certain statistical regularities and patterns, which we begin to explore here. By drawing inspiration from linguistics, where Zipf's law states that the frequency of any word in a large corpus of text is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table, we investigate whether similar patterns for the distribution of operators emerge in the equations of physics. We analyse three corpora of formulae and find, using sophisticated implicit-likelihood methods, that the frequency of operators as a function of their rank in the frequency table is best described by an exponential law with a stable exponent, in contrast with Zipf's inverse power-law. Understanding the underlying reasons behind this statistical pattern may shed light on Nature's modus operandi or reveal recurrent patterns in physicists' attempts to formalise the laws of Nature. It may also provide crucial input for symbolic regression, potentially augmenting language models to generate symbolic models for physical phenomena. By pioneering the study of statistical regularities in the equations of physics, our results open the door for a meta-law of Nature, a (probabilistic) law that all physical laws obey.</description>

      <title>Polyrhythmic Harmonies from the Sky: Transforming Satellite Images of Clouds into Musical Compositions through Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a context of increasing scientific specialization and deficiencies in the scientific literacy of the population, there arises a need to broaden the methods of scientific dissemination. This study proposes an approach that combines music with scientific concepts, focusing on the sonification of satellite images as the core. A generative musical composition system is developed that uses visual data to create accessible and emotional auditory experiences, thus enriching the fields of scientific dissemination and artistic expression. It concludes with an example of the algorithm's use in a musical composition.</description>

      <title>Impact of changing the wet deposition schemes in ldx on 137-cs atmosperic deposits after the fukushima accident</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fukushima-Daiichi release of radioactivity is a relevant event to study the atmospheric dispersion modelling of radionuclides. Actually, the atmospheric deposition onto the ground may be studied through the map of measured Cs-137 established consecutively to the accident. The limits of detection were low enough to make the measurements possible as far as 250km from the nuclear power plant. This large scale deposition has been modelled with the Eulerian model ldX. However, several weeks of emissions in multiple weather conditions make it a real challenge. Besides, these measurements are accumulated deposition of Cs-137 over the whole period and do not inform of deposition mechanisms involved: in-cloud, below-cloud, dry deposition. In a previous study (Qu{\'e}rel et al., 2016), a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed in order to understand wet deposition mechanisms. It has been shown that the choice of the wet deposition scheme has a strong impact on assessment of deposition patterns. Nevertheless, a ``best'' scheme could not be highlighted as it depends on the selected criteria: the ranking differs according to the statistical indicators considered (correlation, figure of merit in space and factor 2). A possibility to explain the difficulty to discriminate between several schemes was the uncertainties in the modelling, resulting from the meteorological data for instance. Since the move of the plume is not properly modelled, the deposition processes are applied with an inaccurate activity concentration in the air. In the framework of the SAKURA project, an MRI-IRSN collaboration, new meteorological fields at higher resolution (Sekiyama et al., 2013) were provided and allow to reconsider the previous study. An update including these new meteorology data is presented. In addition, the focus is put on the deposition schemes commonly used in nuclear emergency context.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Comparison Between Independent Cascade and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cascades in social networks with the independent cascade (IC) model and the Susceptible-Infected-recovered (SIR) model. The well-studied IC model fails to capture the feature of node recovery, and the SIR model is a variant of the IC model with the node recovery feature. In the SIR model, by computing the probability that a node successfully infects another before its recovery and viewing this probability as the corresponding IC parameter, the SIR model becomes an "out-going-edge-correlated" version of the IC model: the events of the infections along different out-going edges of a node become dependent in the SIR model, whereas these events are independent in the IC model. In this paper, we thoroughly compare the two models and examine the effect of this extra dependency in the SIR model. By a carefully designed coupling argument, we show that the seeds in the IC model have a stronger influence spread than their counterparts in the SIR model, and sometimes it can be significantly stronger. Specifically, we prove that, given the same network, the same seed sets, and the parameters of the two models being set based on the above-mentioned equivalence, the expected number of infected nodes at the end of the cascade for the IC model is weakly larger than that for the SIR model, and there are instances where this dominance is significant. We also study the influence maximization problem with the SIR model. We show that the above-mentioned difference in the two models yields different seed-selection strategies, which motivates the design of influence maximization algorithms specifically for the SIR model. We design efficient approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees by adapting the reverse-reachable-set-based algorithms, commonly used for the IC model, to the SIR model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of financial stocks network: improving forecasting using network properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying a network analysis to stock return correlations, we study the dynamical properties of the network and how they correlate with the market return, finding meaningful variables that partially capture the complex dynamical processes of stock interactions and the market structure. We then use the individual properties of stocks within the network along with the global ones, to find correlations with the future returns of individual S&amp;P 500 stocks. Applying these properties as input variables for forecasting, we find a 50% improvement on the R2score in the prediction of stock returns on long time scales (per year), and 3% on short time scales (2 days), relative to baseline models without network variables.</description>

      <title>VIRIS: Simulating indoor airborne transmission combining architectural design and people movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Viral Infection Risk Indoor Simulator (VIRIS) has been developed to quickly assess and compare mitigations for airborne disease spread. This agent-based simulator combines people movement in an indoor space, viral transmission modelling and detailed architectural design, and it is powered by topologicpy, an open-source Python library. VIRIS generates very fast predictions of the viral concentration and the spatiotemporal infection risk for individuals as they move through a given space. The simulator is validated with data from a courtroom superspreader event. A sensitivity study for unknown parameter values is also performed. We compare several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) issued in UK government guidance, for two indoor settings: a care home and a supermarket. Additionally, we have developed the user-friendly VIRIS web app that allows quick exploration of diverse scenarios of interest and visualisation, allowing policymakers, architects and space managers to easily design or assess infection risk in an indoor space.</description>

      <title>Probability-turbulence divergence: A tunable allotaxonometric instrument for comparing heavy-tailed categorical distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems often comprise many distinct types of elements as well as many more types of networked interactions between elements. When the relative abundances of types can be measured well, we further observe heavy-tailed categorical distributions for type frequencies. For the comparison of type frequency distributions of two systems or a system with itself at different time points in time -- a facet of allotaxonometry -- a great range of probability divergences are available. Here, we introduce and explore `probability-turbulence divergence', a tunable, straightforward, and interpretable instrument for comparing normalizable categorical frequency distributions. We model probability-turbulence divergence (PTD) after rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). While probability-turbulence divergence is more limited in application than rank-turbulence divergence, it is more sensitive to changes in type frequency. We build allotaxonographs to display probability turbulence, incorporating a way to visually accommodate zero probabilities for `exclusive types' which are types that appear in only one system. We explore comparisons of example distributions taken from literature, social media, and ecology. We show how probability-turbulence divergence either explicitly or functionally generalizes many existing kinds of distances and measures, including, as special cases, $L^{(p)}$ norms, the S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient (the $F_1$ statistic), and the Hellinger distance. We discuss similarities with the generalized entropies of R{\'e}nyi and Tsallis, and the diversity indices (or Hill numbers) from ecology. We close with thoughts on open problems concerning the optimization of the tuning of rank- and probability-turbulence divergence.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Attrition in Science: A Cohort-Based, Longitudinal Study of Scientists in 38 OECD Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how members of the scientific community leave academic science and how attrition (defined as ceasing to publish) differs across genders, academic disciplines, and over time. Our approach is cohort-based and longitudinal: We track individual male and female scientists over time and quantify the phenomenon traditionally referred to as 'leaving science.' Using publication metadata from Scopus - a global bibliometric database of publications and citations - we follow the details of the publishing careers of scientists from 38 OECD countries who started publishing in 2000 (N = 142,776) and 2010 (N = 232,843). Our study is restricted to 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), and we track the individual scholarly output of the two cohorts until 2022. We use survival analysis to compare attrition of men and women scientists. With more women in science and more women within cohorts, attrition is becoming ever less gendered. In addition to the combined aggregated changes at the level of all STEMM disciplines, widely nuanced changes were found to occur at the discipline level and over time. Attrition in science means different things for men versus women depending on the discipline; moreover, it means different things for scientists from different cohorts entering the scientific workforce. Finally, global bibliometric datasets were tested in the current study, opening new opportunities to explore gender and disciplinary differences in attrition.</description>

      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>

      <title>Characterizing limit order books in call auctions of a stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical and dynamical characters of stock markets have been extensively studied, which now is providing the firm basis for econophysics and its application as ``stylized facts''. However, most of those studies are for markets under the continuous auction, i.e. trades are executed sequentially. There has been less research on another major type of auction, call auctions, where orders are accumulated and those are executed at once in the final moment. This study focuses on the structure of the limit order books of stocks under the call auctions. Using the data of all stocks listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we find that the shape of the limit order books in call auctions are well fitted by a simple functional form of hyperbolic tangent. From the fitting, we define the ``median spread'' and the ``width'' of limit orders. The ratio of the ``width'' to the ``median spread'' of most stocks are found to be similar, indicating that the execution ratio (the trading volume relative to the total number of orders) are nearly equal among them. Furthermore, the deviation in this ratio from the majority is found to be a good indicator for finding the stocks of the companies making outstanding profit. Our results demonstrate that those parameters of the structure of the limit order book well characterizes the states of the market under call auctions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical importance and network perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the adjacency matrix of a graph exerts much influence on the behavior of dynamical processes on that graph. It is thus relevant to relate notions of the importance (specifically, centrality measures) of network structures to $\lambda$ and its associated eigenvector. We study a previously derived measure of edge importance known as ``dynamical importance'', which estimates how much $\lambda$ changes when one removes an edge from a graph or adds an edge to it. We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance. Through our analysis and computational experiments, we find that studying dynamical importance can improve understanding of the relationship between network perturbations and dynamical processes on networks.</description>

      <title>State Discretization for Continuous-State MDPs in Infectious Disease Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeated decision-making problems under uncertainty may arise in the health policy context, such as infectious disease control for COVID-19 and other epidemics. These problems may sometimes be effectively solved using Markov decision processes (MDPs). However, the continuous or large state space of such problems for capturing infectious disease prevalence renders it difficult to implement tractable MDPs to identify the optimal disease control policy over time. We therefore develop an algorithm for discretizing continuous states for approximate MDP solutions in this context. We benchmark performance against a uniform discretization using both a synthetic example and an example of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County.</description>

      <title>Diversity and stylization of the contemporary user-generated visual arts in the complexity-entropy plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of computational and numerical methods in recent times has provided new avenues for analyzing art historiographical narratives and tracing the evolution of art styles therein. Here, we investigate an evolutionary process underpinning the emergence and stylization of contemporary user-generated visual art styles using the complexity-entropy (C-H) plane, which quantifies local structures in paintings. Informatizing 149,780 images curated in DeviantArt and Behance platforms from 2010 to 2020, we analyze the relationship between local information of the C-H space and multi-level image features generated by a deep neural network and a feature extraction algorithm. The results reveal significant statistical relationships between the C-H information of visual artistic styles and the dissimilarities of the multi-level image features over time within groups of artworks. By disclosing a particular C-H region where the diversity of image representations is noticeably manifested, our analyses reveal an empirical condition of emerging styles that are both novel in the C-H plane and characterized by greater stylistic diversity. Our research shows that visual art analyses combined with physics-inspired methodologies and machine learning, can provide macroscopic insights into quantitatively mapping relevant characteristics of an evolutionary process underpinning the creative stylization of uncharted visual arts of given groups and time.</description>
