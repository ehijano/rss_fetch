      <title>Superstructure Optimization with Embedded Neural Networks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a multi-objective optimization framework for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, integrating artificial neural networks (ANNs) within a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) formulation. By embedding data-driven surrogate models into the mathematical optimization structure, the proposed methodology addresses key limitations of conventional superstructure-based approaches, enabling simultaneous optimization of discrete process choices and continuous operating parameters. The framework captures variable input and output stream compositions, facilitating the joint optimization of target product composition and system design. Application to Fischer-Tropsch (FT) kerosene production demonstrates that cost-minimizing configurations under unconstrained CO2 emissions are dominated by the fossil-based autothermal reforming (ATR) route. Imposing carbon emission constraints necessitates the integration of biomass gasification and direct air capture coupled with carbon sequestration (DAC-CS), resulting in substantially reduced net emissions but higher production costs. At the zero-emission limit, hybrid configurations combining ATR and biomass gasification achieve the lowest costs (~2.38 \$/kg-kerosene), followed closely by biomass gasification-only (~2.43 \$/kg), both of which outperform the ATR-only pathway with DAC-CS (~2.65 \$/kg). In contrast, DAC-only systems relying exclusively on atmospheric CO2 and water electrolysis are prohibitively expensive (~10.8 \$/kg). The results highlight the critical role of process adaptability: configurations exploiting flexible process parameters, facilitated by embedded ANNs, consistently outperform fixed setups, achieving up to 20% cost savings. Sensitivity analyses elucidate the influence of process conditions, such as FT reactor pressure and gasification temperature, on economic and environmental performance.</description>

      <title>Fraud detection and risk assessment of online payment transactions on e-commerce platforms based on LLM and GCN frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of e-commerce, online payment fraud has become increasingly complex, posing serious threats to financial security and consumer trust. Traditional detection methods often struggle to capture the intricate relational structures inherent in transactional data. This study presents a novel fraud detection framework that combines Large Language Models (LLM) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to effectively identify fraudulent activities in e-commerce online payment transactions. A dataset of 2,840,000 transactions was collected over 14 days from major platforms such as Amazon, involving approximately 2,000 U.S.-based consumers and 30 merchants. With fewer than 6000 fraudulent instances, the dataset represents a highly imbalanced scenario. Consumers and merchants were modeled as nodes and transactions as edges to form a heterogeneous graph, upon which a GCN was applied to learn complex behavioral patterns. Semantic features extracted via GPT-4o and Tabformer were integrated with structural features to enhance detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.98, effectively balancing precision and sensitivity in fraud detection. This framework offers a scalable and real-time solution for securing online payment environments and provides a promising direction for applying graph-based deep learning in financial fraud prevention.</description>

      <title>QuantAgent: Price-Driven Multi-Agent LLMs for High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in financial reasoning and market understanding. Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks, leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, such systems are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT requires rapid, risk-aware decisions based on structured, short-horizon signals, including technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend-based features, distinct from the long-term semantic reasoning typical of traditional financial LLM applications. To this end, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents, Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk, each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. In zero-shot evaluations across ten financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, QuantAgent demonstrates superior performance in both predictive accuracy and cumulative return over 4-hour trading intervals, outperforming strong neural and rule-based baselines. Our findings suggest that combining structured financial priors with language-native reasoning unlocks new potential for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Freight Rail Electrification: A Framework for Charge Station Selection and Battery Charge/Swap Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery electric freight trains are crucial for decarbonization by providing zero-emission transportation alternatives. The proper adoption of battery electric freight trains depends on an efficient battery electrification strategy, involving both infrastructure setup and charge scheduling. The study presents a comprehensive model for the optimal design of charging infrastructure and charge scheduling for each train. To provide more refueling flexibility, we allow batteries to be either charged or swapped in a deployed station, and each train can carry multiple batteries. This problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model. To obtain real-time solutions for a large scale network, we develop three algorithms to solve the optimization problem: (1) a Rectangle Piecewise Linear Approximation technique, (2) a Fixed Algorithm heuristic, and (3) Benders Decomposition algorithm. In computational experiments, we use the three proposed algorithms to solve instances with up to 25 stations. Statistical analysis verifies that Benders Decomposition outperforms the other two algorithms with respect to the objective function value, closely followed by the Rectangle Piecewise Linear Approximation technique, and the Fixed Algorithm provides the least optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Discovering Flow Separation Control Strategies in 3D Wings via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to active flow control (AFC) over a threedimensional SD7003 wing at a Reynolds number of Re = 60,000 and angle of attack of AoA = 14 degrees. In the uncontrolled baseline case, the flow exhibits massive separation and a fully turbulent wake. Using a GPU-accelerated CFD solver and multi-agent training, DRL discovers control strategies that enhance lift (79%), reduce drag (65%), and improve aerodynamic efficiency (408%). Flow visualizations confirm reattachment of the separated shear layer, demonstrating the potential of DRL for complex and turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Active Flow Control around a Three-Dimensional Flow-Separated Wing at Re = 1,000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) to reduce flow separation on wings at high angles of attack. Concretely, here the DRL agent controls the flow over the three-dimensional NACA0012 wing section at the Reynolds number Re = 1,000 and angle of attack AoA = 20 degrees, autonomously identifying optimal control actions through real-time flow data and a reward function focused on improving aerodynamic performance. The framework integrates the GPU-accelerated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver SOD2D with the TF-Agents DRL library via a Redis in-memory database, enabling rapid training. This work builds on previous DRL flow-control studies, demonstrating DRL potential to address complex aerodynamic challenges and push the boundaries of traditional AFC methods.</description>

      <title>TubeBEND: A Real-World Dataset for Geometry Prediction in Rotary Draw Bending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents TubeBEND, a real-world dataset comprising 318 rotary tube bending processes, which were collected and sorted by experts from various fields to evaluate machine learning and signal analysis methods. The dataset addresses the industrial challenge of predicting the geometry of a first-stage bend, which can be beneficial for designing machine clamping molds for the second-stage bend in two-stage rotary draw bending. Some geometry criteria, such as the tube's final bent angle (or springback) and its cross-sectional deformation, are being recorded in this dataset. This dataset gives us the possibility to build and test machine learning models that can predict the geometry and help the machine operators with a better machine setup to optimize the tube's springback and deformation. Moreover, by recording some process parameters, such as tool movements and forces or torques applied to them, we deliver detailed information about their impacts on the final tube geometry. The focus of our work is to discover solutions that can replace traditional methods, such as trial-and-error or simulation-based predictions, by including experimental process variables in ML algorithms. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/zeyneddinoz/tubebend and https://zenodo.org/records/16614082 as a benchmark to improve data-driven methods in this field.</description>

      <title>A Role-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Financial Education Question Answering with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) plays a central role in financial education, yet existing large language model (LLM) approaches often fail to capture the nuanced and specialized reasoning required for financial problem-solving. The financial domain demands multistep quantitative reasoning, familiarity with domain-specific terminology, and comprehension of real-world scenarios. We present a multi-agent framework that leverages role-based prompting to enhance performance on domain-specific QA. Our framework comprises a Base Generator, an Evidence Retriever, and an Expert Reviewer agent that work in a single-pass iteration to produce a refined answer. We evaluated our framework on a set of 3,532 expert-designed finance education questions from Study.com, an online learning platform. We leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual evidence from 6 finance textbooks and prompting strategies for a domain-expert reviewer. Our experiments indicate that critique-based refinement improves answer accuracy by 6.6-8.3% over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines, with the highest performance from Gemini-2.0-Flash. Furthermore, our method enables GPT-4o-mini to achieve performance comparable to the finance-tuned FinGPT-mt_Llama3-8B_LoRA. Our results show a cost-effective approach to enhancing financial QA and offer insights for further research in multi-agent financial LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing understanding and clinical applications of cerebral autoregulation: A novel integrated numerical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a fundamental mechanism that modulates cerebrovascular resistance, primarily by regulating the diameter of small cerebral vessels to maintain stable cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to fluctuations in systemic arterial pressure. However, the clinical understanding of CA remains limited due to the intricate structure of the cerebral vasculature and the challenges in accurately quantifying the hemodynamic and physiological parameters that govern this autoregulatory process. Method: In this study, we introduced a novel numerical algorithm that employs three partial differential equations and one ordinary differential equation to capture both the spatial and temporal distributions of key CA-driving factors, including the arterial pressure (P) and the partial pressures of oxygen (PO_2) and carbon dioxide (PCO_2) within the cerebral vasculature, together with a Windkessel model in turn to regulate the CBF based on the calculated P, PO_2, and PCO_2. This algorithm was sequentially integrated with our previously developed personalized 0D-1D multi-dimensional model to account for the patient-specific effects. Results: The integrated framework was rigorously validated using two independent datasets, demonstrating its high reliability and accuracy in capturing the regulatory effects of CA on CBF across a range of physiological conditions. Conclusion: This work significantly advances our understanding of CA and provides a promising foundation for developing hemodynamic-based therapeutic strategies aimed at improving clinical outcomes in patients with cerebrovascular disorders.</description>

      <title>Toward Open Earth Science as Fast and Accessible as Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is natural-language-driven earth observation data analysis now feasible with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs)? For open science in service of public interest, feasibility requires reliably high accuracy, interactive latencies, low (sustainable) costs, open LLMs, and openly maintainable software -- hence, the challenge. What are the techniques and programming system requirements necessary for satisfying these constraints, and what is the corresponding development and maintenance burden in practice? This study lays the groundwork for exploring these questions, introducing an impactful earth science use-case, and providing a software framework with evaluation data and metrics, along with initial results from employing model scaling, prompt-optimization, and inference-time scaling optimization techniques. While we attain high accuracy (near 100%) across 10 of 11 metrics, the analysis further considers cost (token-spend), latency, and maintainability across this space of techniques. Finally, we enumerate opportunities for further research, general programming and evaluation framework development, and ongoing work for a comprehensive, deployable solution. This is a call for collaboration and contribution.</description>

      <title>Faster Random Walk-based Capacitance Extraction with Generalized Antithetic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 50% in number of walks necessary as well as in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.</description>

      <title>Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04996v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are therefore understood as systems that perceive their environment and execute pre-programmed tasks independently of external input, consistent with the SAE levels of automated driving. Yet recent research and real-world deployments have begun to showcase vehicles that exhibit behaviors outside the scope of this definition. These include natural language interaction with humans, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and the handling of unforeseen ethical dilemmas, enabled in part by multimodal large language models (LLMs). These developments highlight not only a gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capacities required for human-centered mobility, but also the emergence of a form of vehicle intelligence that currently lacks a clear designation. To address this gap, the paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs): vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. It synthesizes recent advances in agentic systems and suggests how AgVs can complement and even reshape conventional autonomy to ensure mobility services are aligned with user and societal needs. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs and their potential role in shaping future agentic transportation systems.</description>

      <title>EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed signals into components (base patterns) and their concentrations (intensity), playing a key role in understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified number of components, usually unknown in real data. Once data or component number increases, the scalability of these MCR approaches face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a data generative process (gMCR), and introduces an Energy-Based solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set and their concentrations for reconstructing the mixed signals faithfully. On synthetic benchmarks with up to 256 components, EB-gMCR attains high reconstruction fidelity and recovers the component count within 5% at 20dB noise and near-exact at 30dB. On two public spectral datasets, it identifies the correct component count and improves component separation over MF-based MCR approaches (NMF variants, ICA, MCR-ALS). EB-gMCR is a general solver for fixed-pattern signal unmixing (components remain invariant across mixtures). Domain priors (non-negativity, nonlinear mixing) enter as plug-in modules, enabling adaptation to new instruments or domains without altering the core selection learning step. The source code is available at https://github.com/b05611038/ebgmcr_solver.</description>
