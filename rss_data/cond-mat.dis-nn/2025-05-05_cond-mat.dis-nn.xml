      <title>Dynamical Cluster Approximation for Disordered Systems with Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) that incorporates Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to investigate the interplay between disorder and SOC on a two-dimensional square lattice. By analyzing the average density of states and the self energy, we demonstrate how Rashba SOC modifies single-particle properties in the presence of nonlocal spatial correlations captured by DCA. The return probability exhibits signatures of SOC induced delocalization at finite times. To assess the accuracy of our approach, we benchmark the DCA results against those obtained from the numerically exact kernel polynomial method. The good agreement between the two methods validates the use of the computationally efficient, mean-field-based DCA framework for studying disordered systems with SOC.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of mirror-symmetric disordered systems for broadband perfect transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for achieving broadband perfect wave transmission in complex systems by optimizing symmetric disordered media via inverse design. We show that leveraging symmetry of complex media reduces the optimization's complexity enabling the incorporation of additional constraints in the parameter space. Starting from a single perfectly transmitting state with predefined input and output wavefronts at a specific frequency, we progressively broaden the bandwidth - from a reflectionless exceptional point with a flattened lineshape to narrowband filters and ultimately to broadband quasi-perfect transmission exhibiting a rainbow effect. Numerical simulations based on the coupled dipole approximation are validated experimentally in a multichannel microwave waveguide with dielectric and metallic scatterers. Finally, we demonstrate broadband enhanced wave transmission through barriers highlighting the potential for advanced wave control applications.</description>

      <title>Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>
