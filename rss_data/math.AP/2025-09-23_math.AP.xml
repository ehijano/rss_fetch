      <title>Large-time Behavior for a Cutoff Level-Set Mean Curvature G-equation with Source term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cutoff level-set mean curvature G-equation with a non-negative source term. In particular, we study the large-time behavior of this fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic partial differential equation in two settings: periodic and radially symmetric. Due to the non-coercivity and non-convexity of the Hamiltonian, we are not able to use the standard Hamilton-Jacobi theory and instead rely on the inherent structure to find a monotonicity property and corresponding uniqueness set. Lastly, we discuss the local regularity of the solutions, as well as a representation formula in the radial symmetric setting.</description>

      <title>A Class of De Giorgi Type and H\"older Continuity for Some Problems in Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of De Giorgi type functions, denoted by \(\mathcal{B}_{G(x,t)}\), and establish the H\"older continuity of its elements under suitable additional assumptions on the generalized \textnormal{N}-function \(G(x,t)\). As an application, we prove the H\"older continuity of solutions to quasilinear equations whose principal part is in divergence form with \(G(x,t)\)-growth conditions, including both critical and standard growth cases. The novelty of our work lies in the generalization of the H\"older continuity results previously known for variable exponent \cite[X, Fan and D. Zhao]{Fan1999} and Orlicz \cite[G. M. Lieberman]{Li1991} problems. Moreover, our results encompass a wide variety of quasilinear equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a special concavity property for positive Hessian quotient operators $\frac{\sigma_n(W)}{\sigma_{n-k}(W)}, \ 1\le k\le n-1$. As a consequence, we prove a Jacobi inequality for general symmetric tensor satisfying positive Hessian quotient equation on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Joint inviscid, incompressible, and continuous phenotype limit in nonlocal models of tissue growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously derive the joint limit of vanishing viscosity, singular pressure, and discrete-to-continuous phenotype structure in a class of tissue growth models. Starting from a viscoelastic (Brinkman-type) system describing multiple interacting phenotypes, where pressure depends nonlinearly on total cell density, we establish convergence to an incompressible Darcy-type model with a continuous phenotypic structure. Our analysis builds upon recent advances on the Brinkman-to-Darcy limit and incompressible transitions by David, Jacob, and Kim [arXiv:2503.18870], and on hydrodynamic limits for phenotype-structured populations by Debiec, Mandal, and Schmidtchen [J. Differential Equations 2025]. A key novelty lies in combining all three singular limits simultaneously, under uniform a priori estimates, compactness in space-phenotype-time, and a generalized entropy-dissipation structure. This provides a unified framework for modeling constrained tissue growth with mechanical feedback and phenotypic plasticity.</description>

      <title>Quantitative weak-BV stability of "wild'' solutions to compressible Euler equations, with a view towards higher systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, including important physical models from continuum mechanics, the question of stability for large data solutions remains a challenging open problem. In recent work (arXiv:2507.23645) the authors introduce a framework for showing H\"older stability of potentially "wild" large data solutions, relative to a class of BV solutions, for systems with two conserved quantities. This is referred to as "weak-BV" stability. In this paper, we give a short introduction to the methods while applying them to the "full" Euler system with three conserved quantities. We discuss applications to future work for higher systems with additional conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Non-isentropic cavity flow for the multi-d compressible Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously construct non-isentropic and self-similar multi-d Euler flows in which a central cavity (vacuum region) collapses. While isentropic flows of this type have been analyzed earlier by Hunter \cite{hun_60} and others, the non-isentropic setting introduces additional complications, in particular with respect to the behavior along the fluid-vacuum interface. The flows we construct satisfy the physical boundary conditions: the interface is a material surface along which the pressure vanishes, and it propagates with a non-vanishing and finite acceleration until collapse.
  We introduce a number of algebraic conditions on the parameters in the problem (spatial dimension, adiabatic index, similarity parameters). With these conditions satisfied, a simple argument based on trapping regions for the associated similarity ODEs yields the existence of non-isentropic cavity flows. We finally verify that the conditions are all met for several physically relevant cases in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>High-capillarity limit and smoothing effect of large solutions for a multi-dimensional generic non-conservative compressible two-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and long-time behavior of large solutions, in the high-capillarity regime, for a general multidimensional non-conservative compressible two-fluid model with the capillary pressure relation \(f(\alpha^{-}\rho^{-})=P^{+}-P^{-}\). Our main contributions are threefold. First, for sufficiently large capillarity coefficients, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions in critical Besov spaces for large initial perturbations, under the sharp stability condition \(-\frac{s_{-}^{2}(1,1)}{\alpha^{-}(1,1)}&lt;f^{\prime}(1)&lt;0\), thereby removing the additional negativity restriction assumed by Evje--Wang--Wen [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 221:1285--1316, 2016]. Second, we give a rigorous justification of the global-in-time convergence to the incompressible Navier-Stokes flows and obtain explicit convergence rates in critical spaces for ill-prepared data. Third, if in addition the initial perturbation lies in a lower-regularity Besov space, we derive optimal decay rates for the solution and for its derivatives of any order, revealing a long-term smoothing effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on global large-amplitude strong solutions for multidimensional compressible two-fluid flows. Our analysis exploits the interplay between dispersion (two-phase Gross--Pitaevskii structure) and parabolic dissipation, both induced by capillarity effects.</description>

      <title>Boundary H\"older gradient estimates for fully nonlinear degenerate or singular parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16613v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study boundary regularity of viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear degenerate or singular parabolic equations. The gradient-dependent degeneracy or singularity, along with the time derivative, introduces significant challenges beyond the elliptic case. By combining compactness methods, barrier constructions, regularization techniques, and the boundary regularity of small perturbation solutions, we establish boundary H\"older gradient estimates that unify and extend previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasilinear inequality $ \Delta_m u+f(u)\leq 0$ on a complete Riemannian manifold, where \begin{align*} m&gt;1,\alpha&gt;m-1 \quad and \quad f(t)&gt; 0,\alpha f(t)-tf^{'}(t)\geq 0, \forall t&gt;0. \end{align*} If for some point $x_0$ and large enough $r$, \begin{align*} vol B_r(x_0)\leq C r^p ln^q r, \end{align*} where $p=\frac{m\alpha}{\alpha-(m-1)},q=\frac{m-1}{\alpha-(m-1)}$ and $B_r(x_0) $ is a geodesic ball of radius $r$ centered at $x_0$, then the inequality possesses no positive weak solution. This generalizes the result in \cite{AS,Sun}.</description>

      <title>Rectifiability of entropy productions for weak solutions of the 2D eikonal equation with supercritical regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak solutions $m\colon\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ of the eikonal equation \begin{align*} |m|=1\text{ a.e. and }\mathrm{div}\: m =0\,, \end{align*} arise naturally as sharp interface limits of bounded energy configurations in various physically motivated models, including the Aviles-Giga energy. The distributions $\mu_\Phi=\mathrm{div}\,\Phi(m)$, defined for a class of smooth vector fields $\Phi$ called entropies, carry information about singularities and energy cost. If these entropy productions are Radon measures, a long-standing conjecture predicts that they must be concentrated on the 1-rectifiable jump set of $m$, as they do if $m$ has bounded variation (BV) thanks to the chain rule. We establish this concentration property, for a large class of entropies, under the Besov regularity assumption \begin{align*} m\in B^{1/p}_{p,\infty} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \sup_{h\in \mathbb R^2\setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace} \frac{\|m(\cdot +h)-m\|_{L^p }}{|h|^{1/p}} &lt;\infty\,, \end{align*} for any $1\leq p&lt;3$, thus going well beyond the BV setting ($p=1$) and leaving only the borderline case $p=3$ open.</description>

      <title>Existence proofs of traveling wave solutions on an infinite strip for the suspension bridge equation and proof of orbital stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16693v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computer-assisted approach for constructively proving the existence of traveling wave solutions of the suspension bridge equation on the infinite strip $\Omega = \mathbb{R} \times (-d_2,d_2)$. Using a meticulous Fourier analysis, we derive a quantifiable approximate inverse $\mathbb{A}$ for the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\bar{u})$ of the PDE at an approximate traveling wave solution $\bar{u}$. Such approximate objects are obtained thanks to Fourier coefficients sequences and operators, arising from Fourier series expansions on a rectangle $\Omega_0 = (-d_1,d_1) \times (-d_2,d_2)$. In particular, the challenging exponential nonlinearity of the equation is tackled using a rigorous control of the aliasing error when computing related Fourier coefficients. This allows to establish a Newton-Kantorovich approach, from which the existence of a true traveling wave solution of the PDE can be proven in a vicinity of $\bar{u}$. We successfully apply such a methodology in the case of the suspension bridge equation and prove the existence of multiple traveling wave solutions on $\Omega$. Finally, given a proven solution $\tilde{u}$, a Fourier series approximation on $\Omega_0$ allows us to accurately enclose the spectrum of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Such a tight control provides the number of negative eigenvalues, which in turns, allows to conclude about the orbital (in)stability of $\tilde{u}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16712v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.</description>

      <title>Clustered eigenvalue problem for glassy state relaxation and its inverse problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For computational convenience, a Prony series approximation of the stretched exponential relaxation function of homogeneous glasses has been proposed (J. Mauro, Y. Mauro, 2018), which is the extended Burgers model known for viscoelasticity equations. The authors of [P. Loreti and D. Sforza, 2019] initiated a spectral analysis of glass relaxation along this line, and gave some numerical results on clusters of eigenvalues. A theoretical justification of the results and development of further numerical studies were left open. In this paper, we provide a complete theoretical justification of their results and their numerical verification. Besides these, we solve an inverse spectral problem for clusters of eigenvalues associated with the glass relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of Hasegawa-Mima equation (HME) in bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary condition and singular density under different regularity assumptions on the data. Our approach relies on the coupling of a fourth-order regularization of the HME, the spectral Galerkin method and an appropriate regularization of the singular density. Uniqueness holds in the class of solutions with very mild singularities \`a la Yudovich or with bounded densities.</description>

      <title>The slender body free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the slender body free boundary problem describing the evolution of an inextensible, closed elastic filament immersed in a Stokes fluid in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The filament elasticity is governed by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and the coupling between this 1D elasticity law and the surrounding 3D fluid is governed by the slender body Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) map, which treats the filament as a 3D object with constant cross-sectional radius $0&lt;\epsilon\ll1$. This map serves as a mathematical justification for slender body theories wherein such 3D-1D couplings play a central role. We develop a solution theory for the filament evolution under this coupling. Our analysis relies on two main ingredients: (1) an extraction of the principal symbol of the slender body NtD map, from the author's previous work, and (2) a detailed treatment of the tension determination problem for enforcing the inextensibility constraint. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for various computational models in which a slender filament evolves according to a 1D elasticity law in a 3D fluid. This forms a key development in our broader program to place slender body theories on firm theoretical footing.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear homogenization-based perspective on the soft modes and effective energies of some conformal metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing mechanics literature concerning the macroscopic properties of mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. This amounts mathematically to a homogenization problem involving nonlinear elasticity. A key goal is to identify the "soft modes" of the metamaterial. We achieve this goal using methods from homogenization for some specific 2D examples -- including discrete models of the Rotating Squares metamaterial and the Kagome metamaterial -- whose soft modes are compressive conformal maps. The innovation behind this achievement is a new technique for bounding the effective energy from below, which takes advantage of the metamaterial's structure and symmetry.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations in optimal Besov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the 3D barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equation. We prove global well-posedness, assuming that the initial data $(\rho_0-1,u_0)$ has small norms in the critical Besov space $\mathbb{X}_p=\dot{B}_{p,1}^{3/p}(\mathbb{R}^3)\times \dot{B}_{p,1}^{-1+3/p}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for $2\leq p&lt;6$ and $(\rho_0-1,\rho_0u_0)$ satisfies an additional low frequency condition. Our results extend the previous results in \cite{FD2010, CMZ2010, H20112} where $p&lt;4$ is needed for high frequency, to the optimal range $p&lt;6$. The main ingredients of the proof consist of: a novel nonlinear transform that uses momentum formulation for low-frequency and effective velocity method for high frequency, and estimate of parabolic-dispersive semigroup that enables a $L^q$-framework for low frequency.</description>

      <title>Sharp Onofri trace inequality on the upper half space and quasi-linear Liouville equation with Neumann boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sharp Onofri trace inequality on the upper half space $\overline{\mathbb R_+^n} (n\geq 2)$ by considering the limiting case of Sobolev trace inequality and classify its extremal functions on a suitable weighted Sobolev space. For this aim, by the Serrin-Zou type identity and the Pohozaev type identity, we show the classification of the solutions for a quasi-linear Liouville equation with Neumann boundary which is closely related to the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Onofri trace inequality and it has independent research value. The regularity and asymptotic estimates of solutions to the above equation are essential to discuss.</description>

      <title>Global classical solutions to a two-dimensional chemotaxis-fluid system involving signal-dependent degenerate diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the two-dimensional chemotaxis-fluid model \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} n_t+u\cdot\nabla n=\Delta (n\phi(v))+\mu n(1-n),\\ v_t+u\cdot\nabla v=\Delta v-nv,\\ u_t+ \kappa (u\cdot\nabla) u=\Delta u+n\nabla\Phi-\nabla P, \quad\nabla\cdot u=0, \end{cases} \end{equation*}
  accounting for signal-dependent motilities of microbial populations
  interacting with an incompressible liquid through transport and buoyancy, where the suitably smooth function $\phi$ satisfies $\phi&gt;0$ on $(0,\infty)$ with $\phi(0)=0$ and $\phi'(0)&gt;0$, and the parameter $\mu\geq 0$. For all reasonably regular initial data, if $\mu=0$, the corresponding initial boundary value problem possesses global classical solutions with a smallness condition on $\int_\Omega n_0$; whereas if $\mu&gt;0$, this problem possesses global bounded classical solutions, which can converge toward (1,0,0) as time tends to infinity when a certain small mass is imposed on the initial data $v_0$. These results extend recent results for the fluid-free system to one in a Navier-Stokes fluid environment.</description>

      <title>Proving the existence of localized patterns and saddle node bifurcations in 1D activator-inhibitor type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for constructively proving the existence and stability of stationary localized 1D solutions and saddle-node bifurcations in activator--inhibitor systems using computer-assisted proofs. Specifically, we develop the necessary analysis to compute explicit upper bounds required in a Newton--Kantorovich approach. Given an approximate solution $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, this approach relies on establishing that a well-chosen fixed point map is contracting on a neighborhood $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$. For this matter, we construct an approximate inverse of the linearization around $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, and establish sufficient conditions under which the contraction is achieved. This provides a framework for which computer-assisted analysis can be applied to verify the existence and local uniqueness of solutions in a vicinity of $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, and control the linearization around $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$. Furthermore, we extend the method to rigorously establish saddle-node bifurcations of localized solutions for the same type of models, by considering a well--chosen zero--finding problem. This depends on the rigorous control of the spectrum of the linearization around the bifurcation point. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by proving the existence and stability of multiple steady-state patterns in various activator--inhibitor systems, as well as a saddle--node bifurcation in the Glycolysis model.</description>

      <title>Almost sure global weak solutions and optimal decay for the incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the initial value problem of the incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes equations with initial data being in negative order Sobolev spaces, in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. The generalized Navier-Stokes equations studied here is obtained by replacing the standard Laplacian in the classical Navier-Stokes equations by the fractional order Laplacian $-(-\Delta)^\al$ with $\al \in \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{d+2}{4} \right]$. After an appropriate randomization on the initial data, we obtain the almost sure existence and optimal decay rate of global weak solutions when the initial data belongs to $\Dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $s\in (-\al+(1-\al)_+,0)$. Moreover, we show that the weak solutions are unique when $\al=\frac{d+2}{4}$ with $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Optimizers of the Finite-Rank Hardy-Lieb-Thirring Inequality for Hardy-Schr\"odinger Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following finite-rank Hardy-Lieb-Thirring inequality of Hardy-Schr\"odinger operator: \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{i=1}^N\left|\lambda_i\Big(-\Delta-\frac{c}{|x|^2}-V\Big)\right|^s\leq C_{s,d}^{(N)}\int_{\mathbb R^d}V_+^{s+\frac d2}dx, \end{equation*} where $N\in\mathbb N^+$, $d\geq3$, $0&lt;c\leq c_*:=\frac{(d-2)^2}{4}$, $c_*&gt;0$ is the best constant of Hardy's inequality, and $V\in L^{s+\frac d2}(\mathbb R^d)$ holds for $s&gt;0$. Here $\lambda_i\big(-\Delta-{c}{|x|^{-2}}-V\big)$ denotes the $i$-th min-max level of Hardy-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{c,V}:=-\Delta-{c}{|x|^{-2}}-V $ in $\mathbb R^d$, which equals to the $i$-th negative eigenvalue (counted with multiplicity) of $H_{c,V}$ in $\mathbb R^d$ if it exists, and vanishes otherwise. We analyze the existence and analytical properties of the optimizers for the above inequality.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Analysis of Some PDE and Steklov Eigenvalue Problems with Partially Reactive Patches in 3-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider steady-state diffusion in a three-dimensional bounded domain with a smooth reflecting boundary that is partially covered by small partially reactive patches. By using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these patches for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on these targets. After a brief overview of former contributions to this field, we first illustrate our approach by considering the classical problems of the mean first-reaction time (MFRT) and the splitting probability for partially reactive patches characterized by a Robin boundary condition. For a spherical domain, we derive a three-term asymptotic expansion for the MFRT and splitting probabilities in the small-patch limit. This expansion is valid for arbitrary reactivities, and also accounts for the effect of the spatial configuration of patches on the boundary. Secondly, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-patch limit for a spherical domain. Extensions of these asymptotic results to arbitrary domains and their physical applications are discussed.</description>

  as $\lambda\rightarrow 0_+$, once the modulus $\varepsilon(\lambda)$ satisfies $\varlimsup_{\lambda\rightarrow 0_+}\varepsilon(\lambda)/\lambda=0$. Such an exponent of $\varepsilon(\lambda)$ is nearly optimal in the convergence.</description>

      <title>On the long-time behavior of mean field game systems with a common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the long-time behavior of mean field game (MFG) systems influenced by a common noise. While classical results establish the convergence of deterministic MFG towards stationary solutions under suitable monotonicity conditions, the introduction of a common stochastic perturbation significantly complicates the analysis. We consider a standard MFG model with infinitely many players whose dynamics are subject to both idiosyncratic and common noise. The central goal is to characterize the asymptotic properties as the horizon goes to infinity. By employing quantitative methods that replace classical compactness arguments unavailable in the stochastic context, we prove that solutions exhibit exponential convergence toward a stationary regime. Specifically, we identify a deterministic ergodic constant and demonstrate the existence of stationary random processes capturing the limiting behavior. Further, we establish almost sure long-time results thanks to a detailed analysis of the ergodic master equation, which is the long-time limit of the master equation. Our results extend known deterministic convergence phenomena to the stochastic setting, relying on novel backward stochastic PDE estimates.</description>

      <title>On a zero mass Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky system: ground states, nonexistence results and asymptotic behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following zero mass Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u +q^2\phi u=|u|^{p-2}u,
  -\Delta \phi+a^2\Delta^2\phi=4\pi u^2,
  \end{cases}
  \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^3,
  \]
  where $a&gt;0$ and $q\ne 0$. We complete the study initiated in [2], which relied on a perturbation argument to establish the existence of weak solutions. Here, in contrast, our approach, based on the Mountain Pass Theorem and the splitting lemma, directly yields a ground state solution for $p \in (4,6)$.
  Moreover, by deriving a Pohozaev identity, we further obtain some nonexistence results for suitable $p$. Finally, based on the minimax characterization, we also analyse, in the radial case, the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions obtained as $a\to 0$, thereby establishing a link with the zero mass Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that among all doubly connected and elastically supported planar membranes $\Omega$ with prescribed values of the area $|\Omega|$ and the lengths of the inner and outer boundaries $|\partial \Omega_{\rm{in}}|_1$, $|\partial \Omega_{\rm{out}}|_1$ satisfying $|\partial \Omega_{\rm{out}}|_1^2 - |\partial \Omega_{\rm{in}}|_1^2 = 4\pi |\Omega|$, the concentric annular membrane has the maximal fundamental frequency. The elastic constants $h_{\rm{in}}$, $h_{\rm{out}}$ on $\partial \Omega_{\rm{in}}$, $\partial \Omega_{\rm{out}}$, respectively, are assumed to satisfy $h_{\rm{in}} \cdot h_{\rm{out}} \geq 0$ and can admit negative values and $+\infty$, the latter being understood as a fixation of the membrane on the corresponding part of the boundary. Our study extends and unifies several existing results in the literature. The case $h_{\rm{in}} \cdot h_{\rm{out}} = 0$ is proved using the method of interior parallels \`a la Payne &amp; Weinberger, and it requires less restrictive assumptions on $\Omega$. For the case $h_{\rm{in}} \cdot h_{\rm{out}} &gt; 0$, we develop the construction of the so-called ``effectless cut'' of $\Omega$ described in terms of the gradient flow of the first eigenfunction. This concept was originally introduced by Weinberger and used by Hersch in the fixed boundary case, whose arguments we also revise.</description>

      <title>On the spectral stability of the periodic capillary-gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves in the two dimensional gravity-capillary water wave problem. We derive a stability criterion based on an index function, whose sign determines the spectral stability of the waves. This result aligns with earlier formal analyses by Djordjevi\'c \&amp; Redekopp [15] and Ablowitz \&amp; Segur [1], which employed the nonlinear Schr\"odinger approximation in the modulational regime. In particular, we show that instability is excluded near spectral crossings away from the origin when the surface tension is positive and the inverse square of the Froude number $\alpha\in(0,1),$ which results from the fact that the corresponding Krein signatures are identical. Numerical studies further reveal the existence of a decreasing curve $\beta=\beta(\alpha): (0,1)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+},$ such that the periodic waves are spectrally stable for all $\beta&gt;\beta(\alpha)$. These findings highlight the stabilizing effect of surface tension on periodic capillary-gravity waves.</description>

      <title>Eyring-Kramers formula for the mean exit time of non-Gibbsian elliptic processes: the non characteristic boundary case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new sharp asymptotic equivalent in the small temperature regime $h\to 0$ for the mean exit time from a bounded domain for the non-reversible process $dX\_t=b(X\_t)dt + \sqrt h \, dB\_t$ under a generic orthogonal decomposition of $b$ and when the boundary of $\Omega$ is assumed to be \textit{non characteristic}. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that we do not assume that the process $(X\_t,t\ge 0)$ is \textit{Gibbsian}. In this case, a new correction term characterizing the \textit{non-Gibbsianness} of the process appears in the equivalent of the mean exit time. The proof is mainly based on tools from spectral and semi-classical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter deals with the notion of the resolvent of a self-adjoint operator. We pay special attention to the convergence of unbounded self-adjoint operators in several resolvent senses, and how they are related to the convergence of their spectra. We also explore the relations that these notions of convergence have with the so-called strong graph limit, $G$-convergence, and $\Gamma$-convergence.</description>

      <title>Boundary pointwise regularity for the divergence form elliptic boundary problem on uniform domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundary pointwise regularity for the divergence form elliptic boundary problem. In generality, it is not convenient to define weak solutions for nonzero boundary data on domain with the rough boundary, e.g. uniform domain. However, in this paper, we introduce a definition of weak solutions for the boundary problem on uniform domain. What is interesting is that this definition can be considered to analysis the regularity of weak solutions. In particular, by establishing the energy inequality, we show the boundary pointwise $C^\alpha$ regularity by using compactness methods under the admissible condition. Furthermore, by establishing the linear property of solutions with respective to the harmonic functions, we also prove the boundary pointwise $C^{1,\alpha}$ and $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularities if the boundary data and the boundary of domain are pointwise $C^{1,\alpha}$ and $C^{2,\alpha }$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Electrostatics and Boundary Charges in Continuum Limits of Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) electronic materials are of significant technological interest due to their exceptional properties and broad applicability in engineering. The transition from nanoscale physics, that dictates their stable configurations, to macroscopic engineering applications requires the use of multiscale methods to systematically capture their electronic properties at larger scales. A key challenge in coarse-graining is the rapid and near-periodic variation of the charge density, which exhibits significant spatial oscillations at the atomic scale. Therefore, the polarization density field -- the first moment of the charge density over the periodic unit cell -- is used as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by exploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. Unlike the highly oscillatory charge density, the polarization varies over lengthscales that are much larger than the atomic, making it suitable for continuum modeling.
  In this paper, we investigate the electrostatic potential arising from the charge distribution of 2D materials. Specifically, we consider a sequence of problems wherein the underlying lattice spacing vanishes and thus obtain the continuum limit. We consider 3 distinct limits: where the thickness is much smaller than, comparable to, and much larger than the in-plane lattice spacing. These limiting procedures provide the homogenized potential expressed in terms of the boundary charge and dipole distribution, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions that are also obtained through the limit process. Further, we demonstrate that despite the intrinsic non-uniqueness in the definition of polarization, accounting for the boundary charges ensures that the total electrostatic potential, the associated electric field, and the corresponding energy of the homogenized system are uniquely determined.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit for the for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>

      <title>Motion of a massive rigid loop in a 3D perfect incompressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a rigid body immersed in an inviscid incompressible fluid. In 2D, an important physical effect associated with this system is the famous Kutta-Joukowski effect. In the present paper, we identify a similar effect in the 3D case. For this, we first recast the Newtonian dynamics of the rigid body as a first-order nonlinear ODE for the $6$-component body velocity, in the body frame. Then, we focus on the particular case where the rigid body occupies a slender tubular domain with a smooth closed curve as the centerline and a circular cross-section, in the limit where the radius goes to zero, with fixed inertia and circulation around the curve. We establish that the dynamics of the limit massive rigid loop are given by a first-order nonlinear ODE with coefficients that depend only on the inertia, on the fluid vorticity, and on the limit curve through two $3$D vectors, which are involved in a skewsymmetric $6 \times 6$ matrix that appears in the limit force and torque, a structure which is reminiscent of the 2D Kutta-Joukowski effect. We also identify the limit fluid dynamics as, where, as in the case of the Euler equation alone, the vorticity evolves according to the usual transport equation with stretching, but with a velocity field that is due not only to the fluid vorticity but also to a vorticity filament associated with the circulation around the limit rigid loop. This result is in stark contrast with the case where the filament is made of fluid, with non-zero circulation, since in the latter, the filament velocity becomes infinite in the zero-radius limit. However, considering the inertia scaling that corresponds to a fixed density, we prove that there are solutions for which the solid velocity and its displacement tend to infinity over a time interval of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$.</description>

      <title>The H\'enon equation in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the H\'enon problem in the setting of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta_g u= |x|^\alpha h( u) \quad \text{in }B\\ u&gt;0 \quad \text{in }B\\ u= 0 \quad \text{on }\partial B\\ \end{cases} \end{equation*}where $B$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $g=G'$, $h=H'$ are N-functions and the operator $-\Delta_g$ is the $g$-Laplacian. We show that the symmetric term $|x|^\alpha$, for $\alpha&gt;0$, allows to have radial solutions even for supercritical $H$, generalizing results for the classical H\'enon equation. We also show that radial solutions are indeed bounded. Finally, we state a Pohozaev's identity in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces that we apply to get a range in $\alpha$ for which the problem has no bounded solutions.</description>

Abstract: We prove dispersive bounds for fractional Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb R^n$ of the form $H=(-\Delta)^{\alpha}+V$ with $V$ a real-valued, decaying potential and $\alpha \notin\mathbb N$. We derive pointwise bounds on the resolvent operators for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{n}{2}$, a quantitative limiting absorption principle for $\frac12&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{n}{2}$, and establish global dispersive estimates in dimension $n\geq 2$ for the range $\frac{n+1}{4}\leq \alpha &lt;\frac{n}2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fractional Schr\"odinger operators $H=(-\Delta)^\alpha+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;2\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;1$. We show that the wave operators extend to bounded operators on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for all $1\leq p\leq\infty$ under conditions on the potential that depend on $n$ and $\alpha$ analogously to the case when $\alpha\in \mathbb N$. As a consequence, we deduce a family of dispersive and Strichartz estimates for the perturbed fractional Schr\"odinger operator.</description>

      <title>Long-wave instability of periodic shear flows for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1959, Kolmogorov proposed to study the instability of the shear flow $(\sin(y),0)$ in the vanishing viscosity regime in tori $\mathbb{T}_{\alpha}\times \mathbb{T}$. This question was later resolved by Meshalkin and Sinai. We extend the problem to general shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and show that every $U(y)$ exhibits long-wave instability whenever $\|\partial_y^{-1} U\|_{L^2} &gt; \nu$ and $\alpha\ll \nu$, with $\nu$ being the kinematic viscosity. This instability mechanism confirms previous findings by Yudovich in 1966, supported also by several numerical results, and is established through two independent approaches: one via the construction of Kato's isomorphism and one via normal forms. Unlike in many other applications of the latter methods, both proofs deal with the presence of a delicate term in the linearized operator that becomes singular as $\alpha$ approaches $0$.</description>

      <title>Transition Frequencies and Dynamic Amplification of Buried Lifelines: A Semi-Analytical Timoshenko Beam on Winkler Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underground lifelines, such as pipelines and tunnels, are susceptible to ground vibrations from seismic events, traffic, and other dynamic sources. Accurate prediction of their response is essential for ensuring structural safety and operability. This study introduces a semi-analytical model for transverse vibration analysis of buried lifelines, formulated using the Timoshenko beam theory on elastic foundation. The closed-form analytical solutions revealed that the vibration spectrum comprises four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. At each transition, the oscillatory characteristics of the modes change as a function of the system properties, leading to marked variations in dynamic amplification. The model's validity is confirmed through case studies of buried steel pipelines of varying lengths and operating conditions, showing excellent agreement with finite element simulations. A subsequent parametric study quantifies the influence of key factors - including soil stiffness and system length - on dynamic performance. The proposed method provides a computationally efficient and physically transparent framework for capturing complex vibration phenomena beyond simplified travelling-wave approaches, offering valuable guidance for the design and resilience assessment of underground lifeline systems subjected to various dynamic loads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss all the possible pairs $(u,c)\in C(M,\mathbb R)\times\mathbb R$ solving (in the sense of viscosity) the contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation \[ H (x, d_xu, u) = c,\quad x\in M \] of which $M$ is a closed manifold and the continuous Hamiltonian $H: (x,p,u)\in T^*M\times\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is convex, coercive in $p$ but merely non-decreasing in $u$. Firstly, we propose a comparison principle for solutions by using the dynamical information of Mather measures. We then describe the structure of $\mathfrak C$ containing all the $c\in\mathbb R$ makes previous equation solvable. We also propose examples to verify the optimality of our approach.</description>

      <title>A free boundary problem for an immersed filament in 3D Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a simplified extensible version of a dynamic free boundary problem for a thin filament with radius $\epsilon&gt;0$ immersed in 3D Stokes flow. The 3D fluid is coupled to the quasi-1D filament dynamics via a novel type of angle-averaged Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for the Stokes equations, and much of the difficulty in the analysis lies in understanding this operator. Here we show that the main part of this angle-averaged NtD map about a closed, curved filament is the corresponding operator about a straight filament, for which we can derive an explicit symbol. Remainder terms due to curvature are lower order with respect to regularity or size in $\epsilon$. Using this operator decomposition, it is then possible to show that the simplified free boundary evolution is a third-order parabolic equation and is locally well posed. This establishes a more complete mathematical foundation for the myriad computational results based on slender body approximations for thin immersed elastic structures.</description>

Abstract: This is the second part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for current-vortex sheets in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The local well-posedness of current-vortex sheets with surface tension has been proved in the first part of the paper sequence [63]. In this paper, we prove the incompressible and zero-surface-tension limits under certain stability conditions. The proof of uniform estimates relies on the analysis of the evolution equation of the free interface via a paradifferential approach, the wave equation of the pressure and a weighted anisotropic structure in vorticity analysis.</description>

      <title>On existence of weak solutions to a Baer-Nunziato type system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a dissipative version of a compressible one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for a mixture of two compressible heat conducting gases is considered. The complete existence proof for weak solutions to this system was addressed as an open problem in [6, Section 5]. The purpose of this paper is to prove the global in time existence of weak solutions to the one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for arbitrary large initial data. The goal is achieved in three steps. Firstly, the given system is transformed into a new one which possesses the "Navier-Stokes-Fourier" structure. Secondly, the new system is solved by an adaptation of the Feireisl--Lions approach for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. Eventually, the existence of a weak solution to the original one velocity Baer--Nunziato system using the almost uniqueness property of renormalized solutions to pure transport equations.</description>

Abstract: Consider an eigenfunction of the Laplacian on a torus. How small can its $L^2$-norm be on small balls? We provide partial answers to this question by exploiting the distribution of integer points on spheres, basic properties of polynomials, and Nazarov--Tur\'an type estimates for exponential polynomials. Applications to quantum limits and control theory are given.</description>

      <title>A diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes model for free-boundary problems in the theory of nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes free energy for nematic liquid crystals (NLC) systems, with free boundaries, in three dimensions submerged in isotropic liquid, and a phase field is introduced to model the deformable interface. The energy consists of the original Landau-de Gennes free energy, three penalty terms and a volume constraint. We prove the existence and regularity of minimizers for the diffuse-interface energy functional. We also prove a uniform maximum principle of the minimizer under appropriate assumptions, together with a uniqueness result for small domains. Then, we establish a sharp-interface limit where minimizers of the diffuse-interface energy converge to a minimizer of a sharp-interface energy using methods from $\Gamma$-convergence. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with the diffuse-interface model and the findings are compared with existing works.</description>

      <title>Restriction of Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions to submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Schr\"odinger operators $H_V=-\Delta_g+V$ with critically singular potentials $V$ on compact manifolds, we prove sharp estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to submanifolds. Our method refines the perturbative argument by Blair-Sire-Sogge and enables us to deal with submanifolds of all codimensions. As applications, we obtain improved estimates on negatively curved manifolds and flat tori. In particular, we extend the uniform $L^2$ restriction estimates on flat tori by Bourgain-Rudnick to singular potentials.</description>

      <title>Global axisymmetric solutions for Navier-Stokes equation with rotation uniformly in the inviscid limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equation with constant rotation exist globally for small axisymmetric initial data, where the smallness is uniform with respect to the viscosity $\nu \in [0,\infty)$. This expands the work by Guo, Pausader, and Widmayer \cite{GPW} which showed the global axisymmetric stability of rotation for 3D incompressible Euler's equation, to the viscous case, but for a single threshold that works for arbitrary viscosity. This is achieved by suitably adapting the dispersive framework established in \cite{GPW} to the Navier-Stokes setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining explicit stability estimates in classical functional inequalities like the Sobolev inequality has been an essentially open question for 30 years, after the celebrated but non-constructive result of G. Bianchi and H. Egnell in 1991. Recently, new methods have emerged which provide some clues on these fascinating questions. The goal of the course is to give an introduction to the topic for some fundamental functional inequalities and present several methods that can be used to obtain explicit estimates.</description>

Abstract: In this article we find locally an eigenfunctions for a particular nonlinear hyperbolic differential operator $\Delta_H u^{n}$, where $\Delta_H$ is the hyperbolic Laplacian in the half-plane of Poincair\'e. We have proved that these eigenfunctions are an analytic and non-exact whose coefficients satisfy a specific algebraic recursive rule. The existence of these eigenfunctions allows us to find non-exact solutions respecting the spatial coordinate of nonlinear diffusive PDEs on the Poincair\'e half-plane, which could describe a possible one-dimensional physical model.</description>

Abstract: We show that a sequence of $k$-Hessian eigenvalues of the unit ball in ${\mathbb R}^n$ stays bounded as long as the ratio $n/k$ stays bounded. Moreover, we identify their growth of order at least $(2-1/k)$ in $n/k$. In the case $k=n$, we show that the Monge--Amp\`ere eigenvalues of the unit balls tend to $4$ in the large dimension limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following zero-mass Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equation \[ - \Delta u + \left( \frac{1}{4 \pi | x |} \ast u^2 \right) u = f (| x |, u) \text{,} \qquad u \in \mathcal{D}^{1, 2} (\mathbb{R}^3) \text{} \] with nonlinearity subscaled near zero in the sense that $f (| x |, t) \approx a | t |^{p - 2} t$ as $| t | \rightarrow 0$ for some $p\in\big(\frac{18}{7},3\big)$. A nonzero solution is obtained via Morse theory when the nonlinearity is asymptotically scaled at infinity. For this purpose we prove an abstract result on the critical groups at infinity for functionals satisfying the geometric assumptions of the scaled saddle point theorem of Mercuri \&amp; Perera [arXiv:2411.15887]. For the case that $f (| x |, \cdot)$ is odd, a sequence of solutions are obtained via a version of Clark's theorem due to Kajikiya [J.\ Funct.\ Anal.\ 225 (2005) 352--370].</description>

      <title>Concentration comparison for nonlinear diffusion on model manifolds and P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the mass concentration comparison for a class of nonlinear diffusion equations posed on Riemannian manifolds $ \mathbb{M}^n $ that are spherically symmetric, that is, model manifolds. The concentration comparison states that the solution of a certain diffusion equation that takes the radially decreasing (Schwarz) rearrangement $ u_0^\star $ as its initial datum is more concentrated than the original solution starting from $u_0$. This is known to hold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a consequence of the celebrated P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, which asserts that the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of a function $f$ (belonging to an appropriate Sobolev space) is always larger than the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of its radially decreasing rearrangement $f^\star$. However, if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ is a general model manifold, it is not for granted that the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality holds; in fact, we will provide a simple condition involving the scalar curvature of $\mathbb{M}^n $ under which such an inequality actually fails. The main result we prove states that, given any continuous, nondecreasing, and nontrivial function $ \phi: [0,+\infty) \to [0,+\infty) $, the filtration equation $ \partial_t u = \Delta \phi(u) $ satisfies the concentration comparison in $ \mathbb{M}^n \times (0,+\infty) $ if and only if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. In particular, the validity of such a comparison for the heat equation is sufficient to guarantee that the same holds for all filtration equations. Moreover, we prove that if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports a centered isoperimetric inequality then the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, and thus the concentration comparison, holds. This allows us to include important examples such as the hyperbolic space and the sphere.</description>

Abstract: Given the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian with Robin boundary conditions, (with $\beta\in\R\setminus\{0\}$ the Robin parameter), we consider a shape minimization problem for a function of the first eigenvalues if $\beta&gt;0$ and a shape maximization problem if $\beta&lt;0$. Both problems are settled in a suitable class of generalized polygons with an upper bound on the number of sides, under either perimeter or volume constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model involving state-dependent variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ which allows modeling of systems where noise intensity adapts to the current state. This new flexible theoretical framework generalizes both the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Constant-Elasticity-of-Variance (CEV) models. We prove an existence-uniqueness theorem. We obtain an upper-bound approximation for the model-to-model pathwise error between our model and the GBM model as well as test its accuracy through analytical and numerical error estimates. A detailed comparison of the It\^o and Stratonovich interpretations for the proposed model is presented in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Improved existence time for the Whitham equation and a Whitham-Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time of existence of the solutions to two full dispersion models derived from the water waves equations in the shallow water regime: the Whitham equation and a Whitham-Boussinesq system in dimension one and two. The regime is characterized by the nonlinearity parameter $\epsilon\in(0,1]$ and the shallow water parameter $\mu\in(0,1]$.
  We extend the lifespan of the solution beyond the hyperbolic time $\epsilon^{-1}$. More precisely, we establish well-posedness on the timescale of order $\mu^{\frac{1}{4}^-}\epsilon^{(-\frac{5}{4})^+}$ in the one-dimensional case, and of order $\mu^{\frac{1}{4}^-}\epsilon^{(-\frac{3}{2})^+}$ in dimension two. We emphasize that for the two-dimensional case, we obtain a time of existence of order $\epsilon^{-\frac54}$ in the long wave regime $\mu \sim \epsilon$. This kind of result seems to be new, even for the Boussinesq systems.
  The proofs combine energy methods with Strichartz estimates. Here, a key ingredient is to obtain new refined Strichartz estimates that include the small parameter $\mu$. These techniques are robust and could be adapted to improve the lifespan of solutions for other equations and systems of the same form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear age-structured multi-species model that serves as a unifying framework for ecological and biotechnological systems in complex environments (microbial communities, bioreactors, and others). The formulation incorporates nonlocal intra- and interspecific interactions modulated by environmental covariates. Under general assumptions on mortality, reproduction rates, and interaction kernels, we establish existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions. We illustrate the model's practical relevance along two lines. First, multi-species examples, notably a non-transitive (cyclic) competition model, for which we show that, under the model assumptions, a control applied to a single species can achieve global stabilization of the system. Second, the population dynamics of malaria-vector mosquitoes, for which we develop two control strategies (biological and genetic). In the biological-control scenario, we prove global asymptotic stability of the aquatic compartment by constructing an explicit Lyapunov function. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and compare the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in reducing vector density and malaria transmission.</description>

Abstract: We establish new Euclidean Sobolev logarithmic inequalities in the framework of fractional Sobolev spaces and their weighted version. Our approach relies on a interpolation inequality, which can be viewed as a fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequality. We further relate the optimal constant in this interpolation inequality to a corresponding variational problem. These results extend classical Sobolev logarithmic inequalities to the nonlocal Euclidean framework and provide new tools for analysis in fractional Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>On extremal points for some vectorial total variation seminorms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the set of extremal points of the generalized unit ball induced by gradient total variation seminorms for vector-valued functions on bounded Euclidean domains. These are central to the understanding of sparse solutions and sparse optimization algorithms for variational problems posed among such functions. For cases in which either the domain or the target are one dimensional or the sum of the total variations of each component is used, we prove that these extremals consist of piecewise constant functions with two regions. For definitions involving more involved matrix norms and in particular spectral norms, we produce families of examples to show that the resulting set of extremal points is larger and includes piecewise constant functions with more than two regions. We also consider the total deformation induced by the symmetrized gradient, for which minimization with linear constraints appears in problems of determination of limit loads in a number of continuum mechanical models involving plasticity. For this case, we show piecewise infinitesimally rigid functions with two pieces to be extremal under mild assumptions. Finally, as an example which is not piecewise constant, we prove that unit radial vector fields are extremal for the Frobenius total variation in the plane.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an elementary proof of quantitative uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the Cucker--Smale model under sufficiently strong interaction. The idea is to combine existing finite-time propagation of chaos estimates with existing uniform-in-time stability estimates for the interacting particle system, in order to obtain a uniform-in-time propagation of chaos estimate with an explicit rate of convergence in the number of particles. This is achieved via a method that is similar in spirit to the classical 'stability + consistency implies convergence' approach in numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Classification of global attractors for $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant parabolic equations: a survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey the global dynamics of semiflows generated by scalar semilinear parabolic equations which are $\mathbb{SO}(2)$ equivariant under spatial shifts of $x\in \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $$ u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x),\qquad x\in \mathbb{S}^1.$$ For dissipative $C^2$ nonlinearities $f$, the semiflow possesses a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ which we call Sturm attractor. The Sturm attractor $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ decomposes as $$ \mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}\cup\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P},$$ where $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$ denotes heteroclinic orbits between distinct elements of spatially homogeneous equilibria $\mathcal{E}$, rigidly rotating waves $\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and, as their non-rotating counterparts, frozen waves $\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}$. We therefore represent $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ by its connection graph $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$, with vertices in $\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P},\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and edges $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$. Under mild hyperbolicity assumptions, the directed graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ are finite and transitive. For illustration, we enumerate all 21 connection graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ with up to seven vertices. The result uses a lap signature of period maps associated to integrable versions of the steady state ODE of our PDE.
  As an example, we freeze and reconstruct the connection graph of the Vas tulip attractor, known from delay differential equations, in our PDE setting.</description>

Abstract: In their seminal work (Amer. J. Math. 78: 289-309, 1956), Calder\'on and Zygmund introduced the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator and established its $L^p$-boundedness for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. However, the endpoint case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type $(1,1)$.</description>
