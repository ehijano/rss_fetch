      <title>String Breaking in the Heavy Quark Limit with Scalable Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories require efficient mappings onto quantum computers and practical state preparation and measurement procedures. A truncation of the Hilbert space of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter in the heavy quark limit is developed. This truncation is applied to $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1D$ to map the theory efficiently onto a quantum computer. Scalable variational circuits are found to prepare the vacuum and single meson states. It is also shown how these state preparation circuits can be used to perform measurements of the number of mesons produced during the system's time evolution. A state with a single $q\overline{q}$ pair is prepared on quantum hardware and the inelastic production of $q\overline{q}$ pairs is observed using $104$ qubits on IBM's Heron quantum computer ibm_torino.</description>

      <title>Measurement incompatibility under loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement incompatibility plays a critical role in quantum information processing, as it is essential for the violation of Bell and steering inequalities. Identifying sets of incompatible measurements is thus a key task in this field. However, practical implementations of quantum systems are inherently noisy, making it crucial to understand how noise affects measurement incompatibility. While it is known that noise can destroy incompatibility, it cannot create it. Despite extensive research on measurement incompatibility in finite-dimensional systems -- often tackled using semi-definite programming -- there has been limited progress in understanding this phenomenon in infinite-dimensional continuous-variable (CV) systems, which are highly relevant for quantum information applications. In this work, we investigate the measurement incompatibility of CV systems under the influence of pure losses, a fundamental noise source in quantum optics and a significant challenge for long-distance quantum communication. We first establish a quantitative relationship between the degree of loss and the minimum number of measurements required to maintain incompatibility. Furthermore, we design a set of measurements that remains incompatible even under extreme losses, where the number of measurements in the set increases with the amount of loss. Importantly, these measurements rely on on-off photo-detection and linear optics, making them feasible for implementation in realistic laboratory conditions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Feedback Stabilization of Quantum Light Sources on a CMOS Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonics is a leading platform for realizing the vast numbers of physical qubits needed for useful quantum information processing because it leverages mature complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing to integrate on-chip thousands of optical devices for generating and manipulating quantum states of light. A challenge to the practical operation and scale-up of silicon quantum-photonic integrated circuits, however, is the need to control their extreme sensitivity to process and temperature variations, free-carrier and self-heating nonlinearities, and thermal crosstalk. To date these challenges have been partially addressed using bulky off-chip electronics, sacrificing many benefits of a chip-scale platform. Here, we demonstrate the first electronic-photonic quantum system-on-chip (EPQSoC) consisting of quantum-correlated photon-pair sources stabilized via on-chip feedback control circuits, all fabricated in a high-volume 45nm CMOS microelectronics foundry. We use non-invasive photocurrent sensing in a tunable microring cavity photon-pair source to actively lock it to a fixed pump laser while operating in the quantum regime, enabling large scale microring-based quantum systems. In this first demonstration of such a capability, we achieve a high CAR of 134 with an ultra-low g(2)(0) of 0.021 at 2.2 kHz off-chip detected pair rate and 3.3 MHz/mW2 on-chip pair generation efficiency, and over 100 kHz off-chip detected pair rate at higher pump powers (1.5 MHz on-chip). These sources maintain stable quantum properties in the presence of temperature variations, operating reliably in practical settings with many adjacent devices creating thermal disturbances on the same chip. Such dense electronic-photonic integration enables implementation and control of quantum-photonic systems at the scale required for useful quantum information processing with CMOS-fabricated chips.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coherence generation for precision single- and two-qubit quantum thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum probes, such as single- and two-qubit probes, can accurately measure the temperature of a bosonic bath. The current investigation assesses the precision of temperature estimate using quantum Fisher information and the accompanying quantum signal-to-noise ratio. Employing an ancilla as a mediator between the probe and the bath improves thermometric sensitivity by transmitting temperature information into the probe qubit's coherences. In addition, we analyze two interacting qubits that were initially entangled or separated as quantum probes for various environmental configurations. Our findings show that increased precision is gained when the probe approaches its steady state, which is determined by the coupling between the two qubits. Furthermore, we can obtain high efficiency temperature estimation for any low temperature by changing the interaction between the two qubits.</description>

      <title>Real randomized measurements for analyzing properties of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized measurements are useful for analyzing quantum systems especially when quantum control is not fully perfect. However, their practical realization typically requires multiple rotations in the complex space due to the adoption of random unitaries. Here, we introduce two simplified randomized measurements that limit rotations in a subspace of the complex space. The first is \textit{real randomized measurements} (RRMs) with orthogonal evolution and real local observables. The second is \textit{partial real randomized measurements} (PRRMs) with orthogonal evolution and imaginary local observables. We show that these measurement protocols exhibit different abilities in capturing correlations of bipartite systems. We explore various applications of RRMs and PRRMs in different quantum information tasks such as characterizing high-dimensional entanglement, quantum imaginarity, and predicting properties of quantum states with classical shadow.</description>

      <title>Jacobi matrices that realize perfect quantum state transfer and Early State Exclustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to construct 1D Hamiltonians, that is, Jacobi matrices, that realize perfect quantum state transfer and also have the property that the overlap of the time evolved state with the initial state is zero for some time before the transfer time. If the latter takes place we call it an early exclusion state. We also show that in some case early state exclusion is impossible. The proofs rely on properties of Krawtchouk and Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of quantum causal inference via noninvasive measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the foundations of causal structure inference experimentally. The causal structure concerns which events influence other events. We probe whether causal structure can be determined without intervention in quantum systems. Intervention is commonly used to determine causal structure in classical scenarios, but in the more fundamental quantum theory, there is evidence that measurements alone, even coarse-grained measurements, can suffice. We demonstrate the experimental discrimination between several possible causal structures for a bipartite quantum system at two times, solely via coarse-grained projective measurements. The measurements are implemented by an approach known as scattering circuits in a nuclear magnetic resonance platform. Using recent analytical methods the data thus gathered is sufficient to determine the causal structure. Coarse-grained projective measurements disturb the quantum state less than fine-grained projective measurements and much less than interventions that reset the system to a fixed state.</description>

      <title>Quantum causal inference via scattering circuits in NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report NMR scattering circuit experiments that reveal causal structure. The scattering circuit involves interacting a probe qubit with the system of interest and finally measuring the probe qubit. The scattering circuit thereby implements a coarse-grained projective measurement. Causal structure refers to which events influence others and in the quantum case corresponds to different quantum circuit structures. In classical scenarios, intervention is commonly used to infer causal structure. In this quantum scenario of a bipartite system at two times, we demonstrate via scattering circuit experiments that coarse-grained measurements alone suffice for determining the causal structure. The experiment is undertaken by manipulating the nuclear spins of four Carbon-13 atoms in crotonic acid. The data analysis determines the compatibility of the data with given causal structures via representing the data as a pseudo density matrix (PDM) and analysing properties of the PDM. We demonstrate the successful identification of the causal structure for partial swap channels and fully decohering channels.</description>

      <title>Dynamic manifestation of exception points in a non-Hermitian continuous model with an imaginary periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are distinct characteristics of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. In this study, we focus on EPs in continuous systems rather than discrete non-Hermitian systems, which are commonly investigated in both the experimental and theoretical studies. The non-Hermiticity of the system stems from the local imaginary potential, which can be effectively achieved through particle loss in recent quantum simulation setups. Leveraging the discrete Fourier transform, the dynamics of EPs within the low-energy sector can be well modeled by a Stark ladder system under the influence of a non-Hermitian tilted potential. To illustrate this, we systematically investigate continuous systems with finite imaginary potential wells and demonstrate the distinctive EP dynamics across different orders. Our investigation sheds light on EP behaviors, potentially catalyzing further exploration of EP phenomena across a variety of quantum simulation setups.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum pairwise coalescence of eigenstates in a class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-Hermitian tight-binding one-dimensional Hamiltonians and show that imposing a certain symmetry causes all eigenvalues to pair up and the corresponding eigenstates to coalesce in pairs. This Pairwise Coalescence (PC) is an enhanced version of an exceptional point -- the complete spectrum pairs up, not just one pair of eigenstates. The symmetry is that of reflection excluding the central two sites, and allowing flipping of non-reciprocal hoppings (``generalized off-center reflection symmetry''). Two simple examples of PC exist in the literature -- our construction encompasses these examples and extends them to a vast class of Hamiltonians. We study several families of such Hamiltonians, extend to cases of full-spectrum higher-order coalescences, and show how the PC point corresponds to amplified non-orthogonality of the eigenstates and enhanced loss of norm in time evolution.</description>

      <title>Monitoring-feedback induced entanglement relaxations in a tilted free fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions attracting significant attention, yet the feedback-induced skin effect in tilted fields remains understudied. This work investigates entanglement relaxation and dynamical transitions in a fermionic chain subject to generalized monitoring and an applied tilted field. We show that the feedback-induced skin effect persists with tilting, though relaxation time increases. For small tilts, bipartite entanglement exhibits a widened metastable phase, transitioning from a logarithmic-law to an area-law phase. In contrast, strong tilts accelerate relaxation, leading to a single area-law phase. Moreover, due to the unique properties of the tilted chain, we examine the impact of the boundary on entanglement relaxation. This work not only deepens our understanding of the role of feedback in measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions but also enhances our comprehension of the non-Hermitian skin effect beyond the no-click limit.</description>

      <title>Error-mitigated initialization of surface codes with non-Pauli stabilizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction represents a significant milestone in large-scale quantum computing, with the surface code being a prominent strategy due to its high error threshold and experimental feasibility. However, it is challenging to implement non-Clifford logical gates in a fault-tolerant way with low overhead, through the conventional magic state distillation technique. Here, we enhance the performance of the conventional surface code by incorporating non-Pauli stabilizers and introduce two innovative initialization protocols. Our approach enhances the fidelity of the initialization of non-Clifford logical state by avoiding unprotected operations before the encoding process. This improved fidelity of the initialization of non-Clifford logical states reduces the necessary number of logical qubits for precise state distillation, ultimately decreasing the overall resource overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to entangle logical qubits in non-Pauli and Pauli bases via the lattice surgery technique. This integration enables the use of Pauli-based surface codes for computation while non-Pauli codes are employed for auxiliary qubit initialization, thus compatible with the conventional wisdom of logical Clifford operation based on the Pauli-based surface code.</description>

      <title>Low bit-flip rate probabilistic error cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise remains one of the most significant challenges in the development of reliable and scalable quantum processors. While quantum error correction and mitigation techniques offer potential solutions, they are often limited by the substantial hardware overhead required. To address this, tailored approaches that exploit specific hardware characteristics have emerged. In quantum computing architectures utilizing cat-qubits, the inherent exponential suppression of bit-flip errors can significantly reduce the qubit count needed for effective error correction. In this work, we explore how the unique noise bias of cat-qubits can be harnessed to enhance error mitigation efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that the sampling cost associated with probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) methods can be substantially lowered when applied to circuits built on cat-qubits, provided the gates used preserve the noise bias. Our error mitigation scheme is benchmarked across various quantum machine learning circuits, showcasing its practical advantages.</description>

      <title>New random compiler for Hamiltonians via Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms, such as adiabatic algorithms (\textit{e.g.} AQC) and phase randomisation, require simulating Hamiltonian evolution. In addition, the simulation of physical systems is an important objective in its own right. In many cases, the Hamiltonian is complex at first sight, but can be decomposed as a linear combination of simple ones; for instance, a sum of local Hamiltonians for Ising models or a sum of time-independent Hamiltonians with time-dependent coefficients (which is typically the case for adiabatic algorithms). In this paper we develop a new compiler, similar to the first order randomized Trotter, or qDRIFT~\cite{campbellRandomCompilerFast2019}, but with an arguably simpler framework. It is more versatile as it supports a large class of randomisation schemes and as well as time-dependent weights. We first present the model and derive its governing equations. We then define and analyze the simulation error for a sum of two Hamiltonians, and generalize it to a sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians. We prove that the number of gates necessary to simulate the weighted sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians of magnitude $C$ during a time $T$ with an error less than $\epsilon_0$ grows as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(C^2T^2\epsilon_0^{-1}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Measurement of Sub-10 kHz Optical Linewidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state lifetimes $T_2$, or equivalently homogeneous linewidths $\Gamma_h = 1/\pi T_2$, are a key parameter for understanding decoherence processes in quantum systems and assessing their potential for applications in quantum technologies. The most common tool for measuring narrow optical homogeneous linewidths, i.e. long $T_2$, is the measurement of coherent photon echo emissions, which however gives very weak signal when the number of emitters is small. This strongly hampers the development of nano-materials, such as those based on rare earth ions, for quantum communication and processing. In this work we propose, and demonstrate in an erbium doped crystal, a measurement of photon echoes based on incoherent fluorescence detection and its variance analysis. It gives access to $T_2$ through a much larger signal than direct photon echo detection, and, importantly, without the need for a highly coherent laser. Our results thus open the way to efficiently assess the properties of a broad range of emitters and materials for applications in quantum nano-photonics.</description>

      <title>EO-GRAPE and EO-DRLPE: Open and Closed Loop Approaches for Energy Efficient Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the possibility of using quantum optimal control techniques to co-optimize the energetic cost and the process fidelity of a quantum unitary gate. The energetic cost is theoretically defined, and thereby, the gradient of the energetic cost for pulse engineering is derived. We empirically demonstrate the Pareto optimality in the trade-off between process fidelity and energetic cost. Thereafter, two novel numerical quantum optimal control approaches are proposed: (i) energy-optimized gradient ascent pulse engineering (EO-GRAPE) as an open-loop gradient-based method, and (ii) energy-optimized deep reinforcement learning for pulse engineering (EO-DRLPE) as a closed-loop method. The performance of both methods is probed in the presence of increasing noise. We find that the EO-GRAPE method performs better than the EO-DRLPE methods with and without a warm start for most experimental settings. Additionally, for one qubit unitary gate, we illustrate the correlation between the Bloch sphere path length and the energetic cost.</description>

      <title>Combining Entangled and Non-Entangled Based Quantum Key Distribution Protocol With GHZ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid Quantum Key Distribution ,QKD, protocol that combines entanglement based and non entanglement based approaches to optimize security and the number of generated keys. We introduce a dynamic system that integrates a three particle GHZ state method with the two state B92 protocol, using a quantum superposition state to probabilistically switch between them. The GHZ state component leverages strong three particle entanglement correlations for enhanced security, while the B92 component offers simplicity and potentially higher key generation rates. Implemented and simulated using Qiskit, our approach demonstrates higher number of generated keys compared to standalone protocols while maintaining robust security. We present a comprehensive analysis of the security properties and performance characteristics of the proposed protocol. The results show that this combined method effectively balances the trade offs inherent in QKD systems, offering a flexible framework adaptable to varying channel conditions and security requirements.This research contributes to ongoing efforts to make QKD more practical and efficient, potentially advancing the development of large scale, secured quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Few measurement shots challenge generalization in learning to classify entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to extract general laws from a few known examples depends on the complexity of the problem and on the amount of training data. In the quantum setting, the learner's generalization performance is further challenged by the destructive nature of quantum measurements that, together with the no-cloning theorem, limits the amount of information that can be extracted from each training sample. In this paper we focus on hybrid quantum learning techniques where classical machine-learning methods are paired with quantum algorithms and show that, in some settings, the uncertainty coming from a few measurement shots can be the dominant source of errors. We identify an instance of this possibly general issue by focusing on the classification of maximally entangled vs. separable states, showing that this toy problem becomes challenging for learners unaware of entanglement theory. Finally, we introduce an estimator based on classical shadows that performs better in the big data, few copy regime. Our results show that the naive application of classical machine-learning methods to the quantum setting is problematic, and that a better theoretical foundation of quantum learning is required.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Individual Addressing of Single Atoms in Quantum Registers at Three-Photon Laser Excitation of Rydberg States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise individual addressing of single atoms in quantum registers formed by optical trap arrays is essential to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators. Two-qubit quantum gates are typically realized using coherent two-photon laser excitation of atoms to strongly interacting Rydberg states. However, two-photon excitation encounters challenges in individual addressing with tightly focused laser beams due to atom position uncertainty and the spatial inhomogeneity in both Rabi frequencies and light shifts. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the fidelity of individual addressing can be improved by employing coherent three-photon laser excitation of Rydberg states. For a specific example of $5s_{1/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_1}\!5p_{3/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_2}\!6s_{1/2}\!\xrightarrow{\Omega_3}\!np$ excitation in $^{87}$Rb atoms, we find that upon strong laser coupling in the second step (Rabi frequency $\Omega_2$) and moderate coupling in the first and third steps (Rabi frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_3$), the three-photon Rabi frequency is given by $\Omega \!=\!\Omega_1\Omega_3/\Omega_2$. If the spatial distributions of $(\Omega_1\Omega_3)$ and $\Omega_2$ are arranged to be identical, $\Omega$ becomes independent of atom position, even within very tightly focused laser beams. This approach dramatically improves individual addressing of Rydberg excitation for neighboring atoms in trap arrays compared to conventional two-photon excitation schemes. Our findings are crucial for large-scale quantum registers of neutral atoms, where distances between adjacent atoms should be minimized to ensure stronger Rydberg interactions and compact arrangement of atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), characterizing abrupt changes in entanglement properties in quantum many-body systems subjected to unitary evolution with interspersed projective measurements, have garnered increasing interest. In this work, we generalize the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) driven critical dynamics that has achieved great success in traditional quantum and classical phase transitions to MIPT. By linearly changing the measurement probability $p$ to cross the critical point $p_c$ with driving velocity $R$, we identify the dynamic scaling relation of the entanglement entropy $S$ versus $R$ at $p_c$. For decreasing $p$ from the area-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\propto \ln R$; while for increasing $p$ from the volume-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\propto R^{1/r}$ in which $r=z+1/\nu$ with $z$ and $\nu$ being the dynamic and correlation length exponents, respectively. Moreover, we find that the driven dynamics from the volume-law phase violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of the KZ mechanism. In spite of this, a unified finite-time scaling (FTS) form can be developed to describe these scaling behaviors. Besides, the dynamic scaling of the entanglement entropy of an auxiliary qubit $S_Q$ is also investigated to further confirm the universality of the FTS form. By successfully establishing the driven dynamic scaling theory of this newfashioned entanglement transition, we bring a new fundamental perspective into MIPT that can be detected in fast-developing quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Policy Gradient in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametrised quantum circuits offer expressive and data-efficient representations for machine learning. Due to quantum states residing in a high-dimensional complex Hilbert space, parametrised quantum circuits have a natural interpretation in terms of kernel methods. The representation of quantum circuits in terms of quantum kernels has been studied widely in quantum supervised learning, but has been overlooked in the context of quantum reinforcement learning. This paper proposes parametric and non-parametric policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms with quantum kernel policies in quantum environments. This approach, implemented with both numerical and analytical quantum policy gradient techniques, allows exploiting the many advantages of kernel methods, including available analytic forms for the gradient of the policy and tunable expressiveness. The proposed approach is suitable for vector-valued action spaces and each of the formulations demonstrates a quadratic reduction in query complexity compared to their classical counterparts. Two actor-critic algorithms, one based on stochastic policy gradient and one based on deterministic policy gradient (comparable to the popular DDPG algorithm), demonstrate additional query complexity reductions compared to quantum policy gradient algorithms under favourable conditions.</description>

      <title>A hybrid single quantum dot coupled cavity on a CMOS-compatible SiC photonic chip for Purcell-enhanced deterministic single-photon emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control nonclassical light emission from a single quantum emitter by an integrated cavity may unleash new perspectives for integrated photonic quantum applications. However, coupling a single quantum emitter to cavity within photonic circuitry towards creation of the Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission is elusive due to the complexity of integrating active devices in low-loss photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate a hybrid micro-ring resonator (HMRR) coupled with self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) for cavity-enhanced deterministic single-photon emission. The HMRR cavity supports whispering-gallery modes with quality factors up to 7800. By further introducing a micro-heater, we show that the photon emission of QDs can be locally and dynamically tuned over one free spectral ranges of the HMRR (~4 nm). This allows precise tuning of individual QDs in resonance with the cavity modes, thereby enhancing single-photon emission with a Purcell factor of about 4.9. Our results on the hybrid integrated cavities coupled with two-level quantum emitters emerge as promising devices for chip-based scalable photonic quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrastructure development of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) is critical to the integration of electrical vehicles (EVs) into transportation systems, which requires significant investment and has long-term impact on the adoption of EVs. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to identify the optimal placement of EVCS by utilizing a novel quantum annealing (QA) algorithm and quantum computation (QC). The objective of the optimization model is to determine the locations of EVCS that maximize their service quality for EV users. The model is validated using a real-world case study and solved using commercially available quantum computers from D-Wave. The case study shows that the QA algorithm can find the optimal placement of EVCS within seconds. The quality of the solutions obtained using QC is not sensitive to the shape or size of the area where EVCS are to be deployed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a Silicon-Vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback's causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Homotopy Analysis Method with Secondary Linearization for Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial for modeling complex fluid dynamics and are foundational to many computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. However, solving these nonlinear PDEs is challenging due to the vast computational resources they demand, highlighting the pressing need for more efficient computational methods. Quantum computing offers a promising but technically challenging approach to solving nonlinear PDEs. Recently, Liao proposed a framework that leverages quantum computing to accelerate the solution of nonlinear PDEs based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM), a semi-analytical technique that transforms nonlinear PDEs into a series of linear PDEs. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum computing poses a major limitation, where directly applying quantum simulation to each HAM step results in exponential complexity growth with the HAM truncation order. This study introduces a "secondary linearization" approach that maps the whole HAM process into a system of linear PDEs, allowing for a one-time solution using established quantum PDE solvers. Our method preserves the exponential speedup of quantum linear PDE solvers while ensuring that computational complexity increases only polynomially with the HAM truncation order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to the Burgers' equation and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Our approach provides a novel pathway for transforming nonlinear PDEs into linear PDEs, with potential applications to fluid dynamics. This work thus lays the foundation for developing quantum algorithms capable of solving the Navier-Stokes equations, ultimately offering a promising route to accelerate their solutions using quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interaction and entanglement between two superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interaction between two spatially separated subsystems plays a crucial role in signal processing and quantum networks. Here, we propose an efficient scheme to achieve nonreciprocal interaction and entanglement between two qubits by combining coherent and dissipative couplings in a superconducting platform, where two coherently coupled transmon qubits simultaneously interact with a transmission line waveguide. The coherent interaction between the transmon qubits can be achieved via capacitive coupling or via an intermediary cavity mode, while the dissipative interaction is induced by the transmission line via reservoir engineering. With high tunability of superconducting qubits, their positions along the transmission line can be adjusted to tune the dissipative coupling, enabling to tailor reciprocal and nonreciprocal interactions between the qubits. A fully nonreciprocal interaction can be achieved when the separation between the two qubits is $(4n+3)\lambda_{0} /4$, where $n$ is an integer and $\lambda_{0}$ is the photon wavelength. This nonreciprocal interaction enables the generation of nonreciprocal entanglement between the two transmon qubits. Furthermore, applying a drive field to one of the qubit can stabilize the system into a nonreciprocal steady-state entangled state. Remarkably, the nonreciprocal interaction in this work does not rely on the presence of nonlinearity or complex configurations, which has more potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices, processing quantum information, and building quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for investigating the non-classical collective relaxation in arrays of {\Lambda}-type three-level atoms, where the two optical transitions coupled to a pair of orthogonal chiral or achiral waveguide modes. We demonstrate that the atomic entanglement emerges in the course of relaxation and persists in the final steady state of the system. We also reveal the entanglement of among the emitted photons as well as between the atoms and the photons. The presence and the degree of the entanglement depends crucially on the interatomic distance and the chirality of the waveguide. Our findings open a new way to engineer dissipation-induced entanglement.</description>

      <title>Emergence of steady quantum transport in a superconducting processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum transport is crucial to technological advances ranging from nanoelectronics to thermal management. In essence, it deals with the coherent transfer of energy and (quasi-)particles through quantum channels between thermodynamic baths. A complete understanding of quantum transport thus requires the ability to simulate and probe macroscopic and microscopic physics on equal footing. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate the emergence of non-equilibrium steady quantum transport by emulating the baths with qubit ladders and realising steady particle currents between the baths. We experimentally show that the currents are independent of the microscopic details of bath initialisation, and their temporal fluctuations decrease rapidly with the size of the baths, emulating those predicted by thermodynamic baths. The above characteristics are experimental evidence of pure-state statistical mechanics and prethermalisation in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Furthermore, by utilising precise controls and measurements with single-site resolution, we demonstrate the capability to tune steady currents by manipulating the macroscopic properties of the baths, including filling and spectral properties. Our investigation paves the way for a new generation of experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum transport in strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an open quantum system linearly coupled to a bosonic reservoir. We show that, in the ultrastrong coupling limit, the system undergoes a nonselective measurement and then evolves unitarily according to an effective Zeno Hamiltonian. This dynamical process is largely independent of the reservoir state. We examine the entanglement breaking effect of the ultrastrong coupling on the system. We also derive the evolution equation for systems in contact with several reservoirs when one coupling is ultrastrong. The effective system dynamics displays a rich structure and, contrarily to the single reservoir case, it is generally non-Markovian. Our approach is based on a Dyson series expansion, in which we can take the ultrastrong limit termwise, and a subsequent resummation of the series. Our derivation is mathematically rigorous and uncomplicated.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT "functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Training with Quantum Auto-Encoder: From Distribution Shift to Noisy Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose test-time training with the quantum auto-encoder (QTTT). QTTT adapts to (1) data distribution shifts between training and testing data and (2) quantum circuit error by minimizing the self-supervised loss of the quantum auto-encoder. Empirically, we show that QTTT is robust against data distribution shifts and effective in mitigating random unitary noise in the quantum circuits during the inference. Additionally, we establish the theoretical performance guarantee of the QTTT architecture. Our novel framework presents a significant advancement in developing quantum neural networks for future real-world applications and functions as a plug-and-play extension for quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Qunicorn: A Middleware for the Unified Execution Across Heterogeneous Quantum Cloud Offerings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are available via a variety of different quantum cloud offerings. These offerings are heterogeneous and differ in features, such as pricing models or types of access to quantum computers. Furthermore, quantum circuits can be implemented using different quantum programming languages, which are typically only supported by a small subset of quantum cloud offerings. As a consequence, using a specific quantum programming language for implementing the application at hand can limit the set of compatible quantum cloud offerings and cause a vendor lock-in. Therefore, selecting a suitable quantum cloud offering and a corresponding quantum programming language requires knowledge about their features. In this paper, we (i) analyze the available quantum cloud offerings and extract their features. Moreover, we (ii) introduce the architecture for a unification middleware that facilitates accessing quantum computers available via different quantum cloud offerings by automatically translating between various quantum circuit and result formats. To showcase the practical feasibility of our approach, we (iii) present a prototypical implementation and validate it for three exemplary application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Subgradient Method using Quantum Annealing for Inequality-Constrained Binary Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a generic solver for combinatorial optimization problems that utilizes quantum fluctuations. Recently, there has been extensive research applying quantum annealers, which are hardware implementations of quantum annealing. Since quantum annealers can only handle quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems using quantum annealers, the constraints must be incorporated into the objective function. One such technique is the Ohzeki method, which employs a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to relax equality constraints, and its effectiveness for large-scale problems has been demonstrated numerically. This study applies the Ohzeki method to combinatorial optimization problems with inequality constraints. We show that inequality constraints can be relaxed into a similar objective function through statistical mechanics calculations similar to those for equality constraints. In addition, we evaluate the performance of this method in a typical inequality-constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the quadratic knapsack problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum machine learning via continuous-variable cluster states and teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach suitable for distributed quantum machine learning and exhibiting memory is proposed for a photonic platform. This measurement-based quantum reservoir computing takes advantage of continuous variable cluster states as the main quantum resource. Cluster states are key to several photonic quantum technologies, enabling universal quantum computing as well as quantum communication protocols. The proposed measurement-based quantum reservoir computing is based on a neural network of cluster states and local operations, where input data are encoded through measurement, thanks to quantum teleportation. In this design, measurements enable input injections, information processing and continuous monitoring for time series processing. The architecture's power and versatility are tested by performing a set of benchmark tasks showing that the protocol displays internal memory and is suitable for both static and temporal information processing without hardware modifications. This design opens the way to distributed machine learning.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalization in Quantum Machine Learning with Margins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and improving generalization capabilities is crucial for both classical and quantum machine learning (QML). Recent studies have revealed shortcomings in current generalization theories, particularly those relying on uniform bounds, across both classical and quantum settings. In this work, we present a margin-based generalization bound for QML models, providing a more reliable framework for evaluating generalization. Our experimental studies on the quantum phase recognition (QPR) dataset demonstrate that margin-based metrics are strong predictors of generalization performance, outperforming traditional metrics like parameter count. By connecting this margin-based metric to quantum information theory, we demonstrate how to enhance the generalization performance of QML through a classical-quantum hybrid approach when applied to classical data.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Annealing Protocol to Solve the Nuclear Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model describes very accurately the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei. However, the exponential scaling of the basis size with respect to the number of degrees of freedom hampers a direct numerical solution for heavy nuclei. In this work, we investigate the implementation of a quantum annealing protocol for nuclear ground states. We propose a driver Hamiltonian with sufficiently large gaps, and validate our approach in nuclei with up to 28 nucleons employing classical simulations of the annealing evolution using a digitalized Trotter decomposition. While the nuclear Hamiltonian is non-local and thus challenging to implement in current annealing setups, the estimated computational cost of our annealing protocol on quantum circuits is polynomial in the number of elements of the many-body basis.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering and entanglement for coupled systems: exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Wigner function in phase space, we study quantum steering and entanglement between two coupled harmonic oscillators. We derive expressions for purity and quantum steering in both directions and identify several important selection rules. Our results extend the work reported in {\color{blue} [Phys. Rev. E 97, 042203 (2018)]} focused on the weak coupling regime, revealing significant deviations in the ultra-strong coupling regime. In particular, Makarov's prediction of a separable ground state contrasts with our exact calculations, highlighting the limitations of his approach under strong coupling conditions. We show that quantum steering between excited oscillators is completely absent even in the ultra-strong coupling regime. Similarly, resonant oscillators have no steering, and ground states cannot steer any receiver state. We find that quantum steering becomes notably more pronounced as the system approaches resonance and within specific ranges of ultra-strong coupling. This behavior is marked by a clear asymmetry, where steering is present in only one direction, highlighting the delicate balance of interaction strengths that govern the emergence of quantum correlations. These results advance our understanding of how excitation levels and coupling strengths influence quantum steering and entanglement in coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use operators from generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the inequality for indices of coincidence corresponding to few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The von Neumann entanglement entropy provides important information regarding critical points and continuum limits for analog simulators such as arrays of Rydberg atoms. The easily accessible mutual information associated with the bitstring probabilities of complementary subsets $A$ and $B$ of one-dimensional quantum chains, provide reasonably sharp lower bounds on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. Here, we show that these bounds can in most cases be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). Surprisingly, in some cases, as we increase $p_{min}$ the filtered mutual information tends to plateaus at values very close to $S^{vN}_A$ over some range of $p_{min}$. We discuss the dependence on the size of the system, the lattice spacing, and the bipartition of the system. These observations were found for ladders of Rydberg atoms using numerical methods. We also compare with analog simulations involving Rubidium atoms performed remotely with the Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Analytically Exact Quantum Simulation of N-Body Interactions via Untunable Decentralized Hamiltonians for Implementing the Toric Code and Its Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new quantum simulation method for simulating N-body interactions, which are tensor products of N Pauli operators, in an analytically exact manner. This method iteratively attaches many two-body interactions on one two-body interaction to simulate an N-body interaction. Those controlled two-body interactions can be untunable and act only on neighboring spins. The strength difference between controlled and target Hamiltonians is normally not more than one order of magnitude. This simulation is theoretically error-free, and errors due to experimental imperfections are ignorable. A major obstacle to simulating the toric code model and modified toric codes used in topological quantum computation is to simulate N-body interactions. We employ the new quantum simulation method to solve this issue and thus simulate the toric code model and its modifications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a novel experimental setup analogous to joint spin/polarization measurement experiments is proposed by establishing a direct relationship between path (momentum) entanglement and concurrence. The results demonstrate that joint-detection probabilities can be governed not only by phase shifts but also by concurrence, which arises from the angle between the motion direction of particles from the same source and the Beam Splitter (BS) axis. This approach aims to set a new standard in entanglement measurement by integrating path entanglement within a concurrence-based framework. Here, we first examine phase-retarder-modified Mach-Zehnder (MZ) configurations within single-quanton systems, subsequently extending this approach to two-quanton systems to establish a connection between spatial correlations and concurrence. Last, by analyzing joint-detection probabilities across various BS configurations, we evaluate the potential of these setups as analogs for spin/polarization measurement experiments.</description>

Abstract: Dipole-phonon quantum logic (DPQL) offers novel approaches for state preparation, measurement, and control of quantum information in molecular ion qubits. In this work, we demonstrate an experimental implementation of DPQL with a trapped calcium monoxide and calcium ion chain at room temperature. We present evidence for one DPQL signal in two hours of data collection. The signal rises clearly above the characterized noise level and has a lower bound on the statistical significance of 4.1$\sigma$. The rate of observation is limited by the low thermal population in the molecular ground rotational state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Purcell effect, a common issue in qubit-resonator systems leading to fidelity loss is studied while its suppression is achieved using a novel qubit readout circuit design. Our approach utilizes a unique coupling architecture in which, the qubit first interacts with a filter resonator before linking to the readout resonator. This configuration enables precise control over the Purcell decay rate and ac Stark factor without impacting on measuring time. The mentioned factor is highly sensitive to the coupling strength between the readout resonator and the filter, meaning that the factor adjustment directly impacts the qubit state detection. A major advantage of this design is that tuning the resonator-filter coupling strength is relatively straightforward, offering flexibility in fine-tuning ac Stark factor.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Error Estimation Method in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error estimation is an important step for error correction in quantum key distribution. Traditional error estimation methods require sacrificing a part of the sifted key, forcing a trade-off between the accuracy of error estimation and the size of the partial sifted key to be used and discarded. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that aims to preserve the entire sifted key after error estimation while preventing Eve from gaining any advantage. The entire sifted key, modified and extended by our proposed method, is sent for error estimation in a public channel. Although accessible to an eavesdropper, the modified and extended sifted key ensures that the number of attempts to crack it remains the same as when no information is leaked. The entire sifted key is preserved for subsequent procedures, indicating the efficient utilization of quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Relation between equilibrium quantum phase transitions and dynamical quantum phase transitions in two-band systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) is an important concept in non-equilibrium critical phenomena, however, its relation to the equilibrium quantum phase transition (EQPT) remains obscure. Substantial evidences have suggested that quenching across the underlying equilibrium phase boundary is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for the existence of the DQPT. In this work, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of DQPTs in two-band systems by introducing the quench fidelity, which is defined as the fidelity between the ground state wavefunctions of the pre-quench and post-quench Hamiltonian, and elaborate it by taking one-dimensional anisotropic XY model as an example. The relation between EQPTs and DQPTs is analyzed in detail in terms of the quench fidelity.</description>

      <title>Evolution of different orders of coherence of a three-qubit system and their protection via dynamical decoupling on an NMR quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generate different orders of quantum coherence in a three-qubit NMR system and study their dynamics in the presence of inherent noise. Robust dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences are applied to preserve the different coherence orders. Initially, DD sequences are implemented simultaneously on all three spins, which effectively protects third-order coherence; however, other coherence orders decay rapidly instead of being preserved. The robust DD sequences were suitably modified in order to preserve other coherence orders. These sequences are applied to the two participating qubits that generate each zero and second order coherence, ensuring their effective preservation. In contrast, first-order coherence is preserved more efficiently when DD sequences are applied exclusively on the qubit responsible for generating it. Instead of performing full state tomography, coherence orders are measured directly using single pulses. The robust DD protection schemes are finally applied to successfully protect two-qubit entanglement in three-qubit star states.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-Limited and Tunable Emission from Charge-Stabilized Nickel Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged nickel vacancy center (NiV$^-$) in diamond is a promising spin qubit candidate with predicted inversion symmetry, large ground state spin orbit splitting to limit phonon-induced decoherence, and emission in the near-infrared. Here, we experimentally confirm the proposed geometric and electronic structure of the NiV defect via magneto-optical spectroscopy. We characterize the optical properties and find a Debye-Waller factor of 0.62. Additionally, we engineer charge state stabilized defects using electrical bias in all-diamond p-i-p junctions. We measure a vanishing static dipole moment and no spectral diffusion, characteristic of inversion symmetry. Under bias, we observe stable transitions with lifetime limited linewidths as narrow as 16\,MHz and convenient frequency tuning of the emission via a second order Stark shift. Overall, this work provides a pathway towards coherent control of the NiV$^-$ and its use as a spin qubit and contributes to a more general understanding of charge dynamics experienced by defects in diamond.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the pump coupling for a three-wave mixing Josephson parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson element-based parametric amplifiers (JPAs) typically require rf pump power that is several orders of magnitude stronger than the maximum signal power they can handle. The low power efficiency and strong pump leakage towards signal circuitry could be critical concerns in application. In this work, we discuss how to optimize the pump coupling scheme for a three-wave mixing JPA by employing microwave filtering techniques, with the goal of maximizing the pump power efficiency and minimize pump leakage without sacrificing other properties of interest. We implement the corresponding filter design in a SNAIL-based JPA and demonstrate more than three orders of magnitude improvement in both power efficiency and pump leakage suppression compared to a similar device with regular capacitive coupling, while maintaining state-of-the-art dynamic range and near-quantum-limited noise performance. Furthermore, we show experimentally that the filter-coupled JPA is more robust against noise input from the pump port, exhibiting no significant change in added noise performance with up to 4 K of effective noise temperature at the pump port.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Integrated-Photonics-Based Systems for Polarization-Gradient Cooling of Trapped Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions are a promising modality for quantum systems, with demonstrated utility as the basis for quantum processors and optical clocks. However, traditional trapped-ion systems are implemented using complex free-space optical configurations, whose large size and susceptibility to vibrations and drift inhibit scaling to large numbers of qubits. In recent years, integrated-photonics-based systems have been demonstrated as an avenue to address the challenge of scaling trapped-ion systems while maintaining high fidelities. While these previous demonstrations have implemented both Doppler and resolved-sideband cooling of trapped ions, these cooling techniques are fundamentally limited in efficiency. In contrast, polarization-gradient cooling can enable faster and more power-efficient cooling and, therefore, improved computational efficiencies in trapped-ion systems. While free-space implementations of polarization-gradient cooling have demonstrated advantages over other cooling mechanisms, polarization-gradient cooling has never previously been implemented using integrated photonics. In this paper, we design and experimentally demonstrate key polarization-diverse integrated-photonics devices and utilize them to implement a variety of integrated-photonics-based polarization-gradient-cooling systems, culminating in the first experimental demonstration of polarization-gradient cooling of a trapped ion by an integrated-photonics-based system. By demonstrating polarization-gradient cooling using an integrated-photonics-based system and, in general, opening up the field of polarization-diverse integrated-photonics-based devices and systems for trapped ions, this work facilitates new capabilities for integrated-photonics-based trapped-ion platforms.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler cooling of a trapped ion in a phase-stable polarization gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions provide a highly controlled platform for quantum sensors, clocks, simulators, and computers, all of which depend on cooling ions close to their motional ground state. Existing methods like Doppler, resolved sideband, and dark resonance cooling balance trade-offs between the final temperature and cooling rate. A traveling polarization gradient has been shown to cool multiple modes quickly and in parallel, but utilizing a stable polarization gradient can achieve lower ion energies, while also allowing more tailorable light-matter interactions in general. In this paper, we demonstrate cooling of a trapped ion below the Doppler limit using a phase-stable polarization gradient created using trap-integrated photonic devices. At an axial frequency of $2\pi\cdot1.45~ \rm MHz$ we achieve $\langle n \rangle = 1.3 \pm 1.1$ in $500~\mu \rm s$ and cooling rates of ${\sim}0.3 \, \rm quanta/\mu s$. We examine ion dynamics under different polarization gradient phases, detunings, and intensities, showing reasonable agreement between experimental results and a simple model. Cooling is fast and power-efficient, with improved performance compared to simulated operation under the corresponding running wave configuration.</description>

      <title>Proposed Five-Electron Charge Quadrupole Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A charge qubit couples to environmental electric field fluctuations through its dipole moment, resulting in fast decoherence. We propose the p orbital (pO) qubit, formed by the single electron, p-like valence states of a five-electron Si quantum dot, which couples to charge noise through the quadrupole moment. We demonstrate that the pO qubit offers distinct advantages in quality factor, gate speed, readout and size. We use a phenomenological, dipole two-level-fluctuator charge noise model to estimate a $T_2^* \sim 80$ ns. In conjunction with Rabi frequencies of order 10 GHz, an order of magnitude improvement in qubit quality factor is expected relative to state-of-the-art semiconductor spin qubits. The pO qubit features all-electrical control via modulating the dot's eccentricity. We also show how to perform two-qubit gates via the $1/r^5$ quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. We find a universal gate set using gradient ascent based control pulse optimization, subject to 10 GHz maximum allowable bandwidth and 1 ns pulse times.</description>

      <title>Bridging classical and quantum approaches in optical polarimetry: Predicting polarization-entangled photon behavior in scattering environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore quantum-based optical polarimetry as a potential diagnostic tool for biological tissues by developing a theoretical and experimental framework to understand polarization-entangled photon behavior in scattering media. We investigate the mathematical relationship between Wolf's coherency matrix in classical optics and the density matrix formalism of quantum mechanics which allows for the extension of classical Monte Carlo method to quantum states. The developed generalized Monte Carlo approach uniquely integrates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for classical scattering, the Jones vector formalism for polarization, and the density matrix approach for quantum state representation. Therefore, this unified framework can model both classical and quantum polarization states, handle multi-photon states, and account for varying degrees of entanglement. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum state evolution in scattering media based on classical optical principles. The validity of the computational model is experimentally confirmed through high-fidelity agreement between predicted and measured quantum state evolution in tissue-mimicking phantoms. This work bridges the gap between classical and quantum optical polarimetry by developing and validating a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies these traditionally distinct domains, paving the way for future quantum-enhanced diagnostics of tissues and other turbid environments.</description>

      <title>Rotation quenches in trapped bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state properties of strongly rotating bosons confined in an asymmetric anharmonic potential exhibit a split density distribution. However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this split structure remain largely unexplored. Given that rotation is responsible for the breakup of the bosonic cloud, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by abruptly changing the rotation frequency. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in both symmetric and asymmetric anharmonic potentials under different rotation quench scenarios. In the rotationally symmetric trap, angular momentum is a good quantum number. This makes it challenging to exchange angular momentum within the system; hence, a rotation quench does practically not impact the density distribution. In contrast, the absence of angular momentum conservation in asymmetric traps results in more complex dynamics. This allows rotation quenches to either inject into or extract angular momentum from the system. We observe and analyze these intricate dynamics both for the mean-field condensed and the many-body fragmented systems. The dynamical evolution of the condensed system and the fragmented system exhibits similarities in several observables during small rotation quenches. However, these similarities diverge notably for larger quenches. Additionally, we investigate the formation and the impact of the vortices on the angular momentum dynamics of the evolving split density. All in all, our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of trapped interacting bosons under different rotation quenches.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the quantum and classical descriptions of gravitational wave detection in interferometers like LIGO. We demonstrate that while a simple graviton scattering model fails to explain the observed arm displacements, both the classical gravitational wave approach and a quantum gravitational energy method successfully predict the correct results. We provide a detailed analysis of why the quantum graviton energy approach succeeds, highlighting the importance of collective behavior and the quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational wave physics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the quantum nature of gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work suggests new avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in small-size 1d and 2d Josephson junction arrays: analysis of the experiments within the interacting plasmons picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretically, Josephson junction (JJ) arrays can exhibit either a superconducting or insulating state, separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). In this work, we analyzed published data on QPTs in three one-dimensional arrays and two two-dimensional arrays using a recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs. The model is based on the insight that the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two characteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale $L_0$ from which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length, $L_{\varphi}(T)$ as given by the distance travelled by system-specific elementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the data for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and self-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting plasmons. In this picture, $L_{\varphi}=v_p\hbar/k_B T$, and $L_0 \approx \Lambda$, where $v_p$ is the speed of the plasmons and $\Lambda$ is the Coulomb screening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the transition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the predictions of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences with recent microwave studies of extremely long JJ chains, as well as with the pair-breaking QPT observed in superconducting nanowires and films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral quantum optics is a growing field of research where light-matter interactions become asymmetrically dependent on momentum and spin, offering novel control over photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. Recently, the platforms for investigating chiral light-matter interactions have expanded from laser-cooled atoms and quantum dots to various solid-state systems, such as microcavity polaritons and two-dimensional layered materials, integrated into photonic structures like waveguides, cavities, and ring resonators. In this perspective, we begin by establishing the foundation for understanding and engineering these chiral light-matter regimes. We review the cutting-edge platforms that have enabled their successful realization in recent years, focusing on solid-state platforms, and discuss the most relevant experimental challenges to fully harness their potential. Finally, we explore the vast opportunities these chiral light-matter interfaces present, particularly their ability to reveal exotic quantum many-body phenomena, such as chiral many-body superradiance and fractional quantum Hall physics.</description>

      <title>A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.</description>

Abstract: As the field of quantum physics evolves, researchers naturally form subgroups focusing on specialized problems. While this encourages in-depth exploration, it can limit the exchange of ideas across structurally similar problems in different subfields. To encourage cross-talk among these different specialized areas, data-driven approaches using machine learning have recently shown promise to uncover meaningful connections between research concepts, promoting cross-disciplinary innovation. Current state-of-the-art approaches represent concepts using knowledge graphs and frame the task as a link prediction problem, where connections between concepts are explicitly modeled. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on dynamic word embeddings for concept combination prediction. Unlike knowledge graphs, our method captures implicit relationships between concepts, can be learned in a fully unsupervised manner, and encodes a broader spectrum of information. We demonstrate that this representation enables accurate predictions about the co-occurrence of concepts within research abstracts over time. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide a comprehensive benchmark against existing methods and offer insights into the interpretability of these embeddings, particularly in the context of quantum physics research. Our findings suggest that this representation offers a more flexible and informative way of modeling conceptual relationships in scientific literature.</description>

      <title>Double-target BEC atomtronic rotation sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-concept design for an atomtronic rotation sensor consisting of an array of ``double-target'' Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). A ``target'' BEC is a disk-shaped condensate surrounded by a concentric ring-shaped condensate. A ``double-target'' BEC is two adjacent target BECs whose ring condensates partially overlap. The sensor consists of an $n\times m$ array of these double-target BECs. The measurement of the frame rotation speed, $\Omega_{R}$, is carried out by creating the array of double-target BECs (setup step), inducing one unit of quantized flow in the top ring of each member of the array (initialization step), applying potential barriers in the overlap region of each member (measurement step), and observing whether the induced flow is transferred from the top to the bottom ring in each member (readout step). We describe a set of simulations showing that a single instance of a double-target BEC behaves in a way that enables the efficient operation of an $n\times m$ array for measuring $\Omega_{R}$. As an example of sensor operation we present a simulation showing that a 2$\times$2 array can be designed to measure $\Omega_{R}$ in a user-specified range.</description>

      <title>Engineering Ponderomotive Potential for Realizing $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ Bosonic Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a $\pi$-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to $\pi$-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized $\pi/2$-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the $\pi/2$-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the geometry in the electronic states of a quantum ripple surface. We have considered an electron governed by the spinless stationary Schr\"{o}dinger equation constrained to move on the ripple surface due to a confining potential from which the Da Costa potential emerges. We investigate the role played by the geometry and orbital angular momentum on the electronic states of the system.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Strong Coupling and It Induced Time Diffraction of Magnon Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we drive a ferrimagnet with periodic pump pulses to construct time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes. We observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges, indicating the time-varying strong magnon coupling and the formation of time interfaces. Using a frequency comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes. The frequency spacing of the multiplied magnon modes inversely correlates with the separation between two time slits, analogous to the well-known Yang's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.</description>

      <title>External Control over Magnon-Magnon Coupling in a Two-Dimensional Array of Square Shaped Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of hybrid magnonics has gained significant momentum in recent years, driven by its potential to enable coherent information transfer and quantum transduction. This study delves into the tunable magnon-magnon coupling within a two-dimensional array of Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) square nanomagnets by modulating its internal magnetic field configuration. Using a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy, we systematically investigate the influence of the orientation of external magnetic field and microwave power on the coupling properties. Our findings reveal a pronounced anticrossing behavior, indicative of robust magnon-magnon coupling, whose strength can be tuned through both static and dynamic external parameters. The ability to modulate coupling strengths in this system highlights its potential for developing flexible and adaptive magnonic devices, crucial for future applications in quantum information processing and spintronic technologies. This work not only broadens the understanding of magnon-magnon interactions in complex geometries but also opens new avenues for the design of next-generation quantum magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>Computable Model-Independent Bounds for Adversarial Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, QML opens doors to novel approaches in machine learning and offers potential speedup. However, machine learning models are well-documented to be vulnerable to malicious manipulations, and this susceptibility extends to the models of QML. This situation necessitates a thorough understanding of QML's resilience against adversarial attacks, particularly in an era where quantum computing capabilities are expanding. In this regard, this paper examines model-independent bounds on adversarial performance for QML. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first computation of an approximate lower bound for adversarial error when evaluating model resilience against sophisticated quantum-based adversarial attacks. Experimental results are compared to the computed bound, demonstrating the potential of QML models to achieve high robustness. In the best case, the experimental error is only 10% above the estimated bound, offering evidence of the inherent robustness of quantum models. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of quantum model resilience but also provides a precise reference bound for the future development of robust QML algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases with reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: We study atomic ground state energies for neutral atoms as the nuclear charge $Z$ is large in the no-pair formalism. We show that for a large class of projections defining the underlying Dirac sea -- covering not only the physical reasonable cases but also ``weird'' ones -- the corresponding no-pair ground state energy does not exceed the one of the Furry energy up to subleading order. An essential tool is the use and extension of S\'er\'e's results on atomic Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Composable and One-Sided-Device-Independent Security Against Coherent Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:1406.6174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secret communication over public channels is one of the central pillars of a modern information society. Using quantum key distribution this is achieved without relying on the hardness of mathematical problems which might be compromised by improved algorithms or by future quantum computers. State-of-the-art quantum key distribution requires composable security against coherent attacks for a finite number of distributed quantum states as well as robustness against implementation side-channels. Here, we present an implementation of continuous-variable quantum key distribution satisfying these requirements. Our implementation is based on the distribution of continuous-variable Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled light. It is one-sided device independent, which means the security of the generated key is independent of any memory-free attacks on the remote detector. Since continuous-variable encoding is compatible with conventional optical communication technology, our work is a crucial step towards practical implementations of quantum key distribution with state-of-the-art security based solely on telecom components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the following hold, unconditionally unless otherwise stated, relative to a random oracle:
  - There are NP search problems solvable by quantum polynomial-time machines but not classical probabilistic polynomial-time machines.
  - There exist functions that are one-way, and even collision resistant, against classical adversaries but are easily inverted quantumly. Similar separations hold for digital signatures and CPA-secure public key encryption (the latter requiring the assumption of a classically CPA-secure encryption scheme). Interestingly, the separation does not necessarily extend to the case of other cryptographic objects such as PRGs.
  - There are unconditional publicly verifiable proofs of quantumness with the minimal rounds of interaction: for uniform adversaries, the proofs are non-interactive, whereas for non-uniform adversaries the proofs are two message public coin.
  - Our results do not appear to contradict the Aaronson-Ambanis conjecture. Assuming this conjecture, there exist publicly verifiable certifiable randomness, again with the minimal rounds of interaction.
  By replacing the random oracle with a concrete cryptographic hash function such as SHA2, we obtain plausible Minicrypt instantiations of the above results. Previous analogous results all required substantial structure, either in terms of highly structured oracles and/or algebraic assumptions in Cryptomania and beyond.</description>

Abstract: There exists a stark tension among different formulations of quantum theory as some are inherently time-symmetric while others are time-asymmetric. This tension is crisply captured when considering physical theories as theories of processes. We present the process theory of quantum physics, QPhys, which treats classical systems as internal to quantum theory. We provide three ways to incorporate time symmetry in QPhys. The first restricts the process theory of QPhys to one that satisfies an additional retrocausality constraint. The second is a novel approach, which extends the notions of causality and retrocausality to apply to systems along with processes. Utilizing this approach, we create a toy model for particle physics , where the causal and retrocausal systems correspond to particles and anti-particles respectively. The third approach extends QPhys to a supertheory that satisfies neither a causality nor a retrocausality constraint. To avoid unphysical predictions we modify either its composition rule or its processes.</description>

      <title>A general quantum circuit framework for Extended Wigner's Friend Scenarios: logically and causally consistent reasoning without absolute measurement events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Wigner's Friend Scenarios (EWFSs) go beyond the standard usage of quantum theory, where agents are treated classically, and instead model agents as unitary evolving quantum systems. This has been the subject of several no-go results: Frauchiger and Renner (FR) suggested that quantum agents reasoning using quantum theory will arrive at logical paradoxes, while other results highlight challenges for having an objective notion of measurement events and for causal reasoning in EWFSs. This raises the question: Is it possible to reliably make and test scientific predictions, and consistently reason about the world when applying quantum theory universally without assuming that observed measurement outcomes are absolute? We give a positive answer by developing a general quantum circuit framework for EWFSs. We formalise the concept of Heisenberg cuts by mapping them to distinct channels in a quantum circuit, and prove that FR-type paradoxes can be fully resolved by making explicit the conditioning on the quantum channels that are used in the reasoning process. We provide concrete rules by which quantum agents can reason and make predictions in a logically and causally consistent manner. Our framework describes all perspectives and predictions of an EWFS within a single, well-defined causal structure, although it allows events to be fundamentally subjective. Moreover, we show that an objective notion of measurement events nevertheless emerges in real-world experiments. This demonstrates the possibility of a relational yet operational framework overcoming challenges to scientific reasoning in EWFSs without modifying the Born rule, quantum unitarity, or the axioms of classical logic and probability theory. This enables analysis of different EWFS arguments and provides a platform to consistently extend quantum information methods and studies to Wigner's Friend Scenarios.</description>

      <title>Observation of Josephson Harmonics in Tunnel Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaches to developing large-scale superconducting quantum processors must cope with the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom that are ubiquitous in solid-state devices. State-of-the-art superconducting qubits employ aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) tunnel Josephson junctions as the sources of nonlinearity necessary to perform quantum operations. Analyses of these junctions typically assume an idealized, purely sinusoidal current-phase relation. However, this relation is only expected to hold in the limit of vanishingly low-transparency channels in the AlO$_x$ barrier. Here we show that the standard current-phase relation fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories. Instead, a mesoscopic model of tunneling through an inhomogeneous AlO$_x$ barrier predicts percent-level contributions from higher Josephson harmonics. By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian, we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra. The presence and impact of Josephson harmonics has important implications for developing AlO$_x$-based quantum technologies including quantum computers and parametric amplifiers. As an example, we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and the associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude, while preserving their anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent feedback control of an N-level atom with multiple excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network, where an $N$-level atom is coupled with a cavity and the cavity is also coupled with single or multiple parallel waveguides. When the atom is initialized at the highest energy level, it can emit multiple photons into the cavity, and the photons can be further transmitted to the waveguides and re-interact with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system. The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multi-photon states. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and the stability of quantum states is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.</description>

      <title>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and other 1-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of a harmonic oscillator, as well as other, simple 1-dimensional problems, is described. Using known, closed-form, path-based propagators for each problem, an integral expression is written that describes the wave function. This expression conventionally takes the form of an integral over initial locations of a particle, but it is re-expressed here in terms of a characteristic momentum associated with motion between the endpoints of a path. In this manner, the resulting expression can be analyzed using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, leading to distributions of paths that exactly describe each eigenstate. These distributions are valid for all travel times, but when evaluated for long times they turn out to be real, non-negative functions of the characteristic momentum. For the harmonic oscillator in particular, a somewhat broad distribution is found, peaked at value of momentum that corresponds to a classical energy which in turn equals the energy eigenvalue for the state being described.</description>

      <title>QECC-Synth: A Layout Synthesizer for Quantum Error Correction Codes on Sparse Hardware Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, their implementation faces significant challenges due to disparity between required dense qubit connectivity and sparse hardware architectures. Current approaches often either underutilize QEC circuit features or focus on manual designs tailored to specific codes and architectures, limiting their capability and generality. In response, we introduce QECC-Synth, an automated compiler for QEC code implementation that addresses these challenges. We leverage the ancilla bridge technique tailored to the requirements of QEC circuits and introduces a systematic classification of its design space flexibilities. We then formalize this problem using the MaxSAT framework to optimize these flexibilities. Evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms existing methods while demonstrating broader applicability across diverse QEC codes and hardware architectures.</description>

      <title>Observational entropy with general quantum priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational entropy captures both the intrinsic uncertainty of a thermodynamic state and the lack of knowledge due to coarse-graining. We demonstrate two interpretations of observational entropy, one as the statistical deficiency resulting from a measurement, the other as the difficulty of inferring the input state from the measurement statistics by quantum Bayesian retrodiction. These interpretations show that the observational entropy implicitly includes a uniform reference prior. Since the uniform prior cannot be used when the system is infinite-dimensional or otherwise energy-constrained, we propose generalizations by replacing the uniform prior with arbitrary quantum states that may not even commute with the state of the system. We propose three candidates for this generalization, discuss their properties, and show that one of them gives a unified expression that relates both interpretations.</description>

      <title>Formulations and Constructions of Remote State Preparation with Verifiability, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote state preparation with verifiability (RSPV) is an important quantum cryptographic primitive [GV19,Zha22]. In this primitive, a client would like to prepare a quantum state (sampled or chosen from a state family) on the server side, such that ideally the client knows its full description, while the server holds and only holds the state itself. In this work we make several contributions on its formulations, constructions and applications. In more detail:
  - We first work on the definitions and abstract properties of the RSPV problem. We select and compare different variants of definitions [GV19,GMP22,Zha22], and study their basic properties (like composability and amplification).
  - We also study a closely related question of how to certify the server's operations (instead of solely the states). We introduce a new notion named remote operator application with verifiability (ROAV). We compare this notion with related existing definitions [SW87,MY04,MV21,NZ23] and study its abstract properties.
  - Building on the abstract properties and existing results [BGKPV23], we construct a series of new RSPV protocols. Our constructions not only simplify existing results [GV19] but also cover new state families, for example, states in the form of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle|x_0\rangle+|1\rangle|x_1\rangle)$. All these constructions rely only on the existence of weak NTCF [BKVV,AMR22], without additional requirements like the adaptive hardcore bit property [BCMVV,AMR22].
  - As a further application, we show that the classical verification of quantum computations (CVQC) problem [ABEM,Mah18] could be constructed from assumptions on group actions [ADMP20]. This is achieved by combining our results on RSPV with group-action-based instantiation of weak NTCF [AMR22], and then with the quantum-gadget-assisted quantum verification protocol [FKD18].</description>

      <title>Experimental high-dimensional entanglement certification and quantum steering with time-energy measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement provides unique ways of transcending the limitations of current approaches in quantum information processing, quantum communications based on qubits. The generation of time-frequency qudit states offer significantly increased quantum capacities while keeping the number of photons constant, but pose significant challenges regarding the possible measurements for certification of entanglement. Here, we develop a new scheme and experimentally demonstrate the certification of 24-dimensional entanglement and a 9-dimensional quantum steering. We then subject our photon-pairs to dispersion conditions equivalent to the transmission through 600-km of fiber and still certify 21-dimensional entanglement. Furthermore, we use a steering inequality to prove 7-dimensional entanglement in a semi-device independent manner, proving that large chromatic dispersion is not an obstacle in distributing and certifying high-dimensional entanglement and quantum steering. Our approach, leveraging intrinsic large-alphabet nature of telecom-band photons, enables scalable, commercially viable, and field-deployable entangled and steerable quantum sources, providing a pathway towards fully scalable quantum information processer and high-dimensional quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the ability of a controller to execute quantum error corrected non-Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaching useful fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on successfully implementing quantum error correction (QEC). In QEC, quantum gates and measurements are performed to encode quantum logic in a spatially nonlocal wavefunction within an error protected Hilbert space. To reach protected logic, classical processing is used to decode the measurements into estimated local errors and eventually logical errors. To date, QEC research has concentrated on developing and evaluating QEC codes and decoding algorithms. In this work, we elucidate that the feasibility of an error corrected non-Clifford circuits hinges upon the classical control system running the QEC codes. In particular, QEC controllers need to perform a key task: decoding-based feed-forward with low latency, defined as the time between the last measurement to be decoded and a mid-circuit quantum operation that depends on it. We analyze how the QEC control system latency performance determines the operation regime of a QEC circuit: latency divergence, classical-controller limited runtime, or quantum-operation limited runtime. This, in turn, implies that any control system intended to execute QEC will need to be evaluated on its ability to perform low-latency decoding-based feed-forward. We define here two near-term benchmarks that evaluate this ability, thus quantifying the potential of holistic QEC controller-decoder systems to successfully execute QEC. These benchmarks and analysis set a standard for evaluating and developing QEC control systems toward their realization as a main component in fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Ground and Excited States from Ensemble Variational Principles</title>

Abstract: The extension of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle to ensemble states $\rho_{\mathbf{w}}\equiv\sum_k w_k |\Psi_k\rangle \langle\Psi_k|$ with fixed weights $w_k$ lies ultimately at the heart of several recent methodological developments for targeting excitation energies by variational means. Prominent examples are density and density matrix functional theory, Monte Carlo sampling, state-average complete active space self-consistent field methods and variational quantum eigensolvers. In order to provide a sound basis for all these methods and to improve their current implementations, we prove the validity of the underlying critical hypothesis: Whenever the ensemble energy is well-converged, the same holds true for the ensemble state $\rho_{\mathbf{w}}$ as well as the individual eigenstates $|\Psi_k\rangle$ and eigenenergies $E_k$. To be more specific, we derive linear bounds $d_-\Delta{E}_{\mathbf{w}} \leq \Delta Q \leq d_+ \Delta{E}_{\mathbf{w}}$ on the errors $\Delta Q $ of these sought-after quantities. A subsequent analytical analysis and numerical illustration proves the tightness of our universal inequalities. Our results and particularly the explicit form of $d_{\pm}\equiv d_{\pm}^{(Q)}(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{E})$ provide valuable insights into the optimal choice of the auxiliary weights $w_k$ in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A truly relativistic gravity mediated entanglement protocol using superpositions of rotational energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental proposals for testing quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) typically involve two interacting masses which are each in a spatial superposition state. Here, we propose instead a QGEM experiment with two particles which are each in a superposition of rotational states, this amounts to a superposition of mass through mass-energy equivalence. In sharp contrast to the typical protocols studied, our proposal is genuinely relativistic. It does not consider a quantum positional degree of freedom but relies on the fact that rotational energy gravitates: the effect we consider disappears in the limit where the speed of light c approaches infinity. Furthermore, this approach would test a feature unique to gravity since it amounts to sourcing a spacetime in superposition due to a superposition of 'charge'.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at superconstant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a classical enhancement to improve the accuracy of the Hybrid variant (Hybrid HHL) of the quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations proposed by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (HHL). We achieve this by using higher precision quantum estimates of the eigenvalues relevant to the linear system, and a new classical step to guide the eigenvalue inversion part of Hybrid HHL. We show that eigenvalue estimates with just two extra bits of precision result in tighter error bounds for our Enhanced Hybrid HHL compared to HHL. Our enhancement reduces the error of Hybrid HHL by an average of 57 percent on an ideal quantum processor for a representative sample of 2x2 systems. On IBM Torino and IonQ Aria-1 hardware, we see that the error of Enhanced Hybrid HHL is on average 13 percent and 20 percent (respectively) less than that of HHL for the same set of systems.</description>

      <title>Accuracy guarantees and quantum advantage in analogue open quantum simulation with and without noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body open quantum systems, described by Lindbladian master equations, are a rich class of physical models that display complex equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium phenomena which remain to be understood. In this paper, we theoretically analyze noisy analogue quantum simulation of geometrically local open quantum systems and provide evidence that this problem is both hard to simulate on classical computers and could be approximately solved on near-term quantum devices. First, given a noiseless quantum simulator, we show that the dynamics of local observables and the fixed-point expectation values of rapidly-mixing local observables in geometrically local Lindbladians can be obtained to a precision of $\varepsilon$ in time that is $\text{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ and uniform in system size. Furthermore, we establish that the quantum simulator would provide a superpolynomial advantage, in run-time scaling with respect to the target precision and either the evolution time (when simulating dynamics) or the Lindbladian's decay rate (when simulating fixed-points), over any classical algorithm for these problems, assuming BQP $\neq$ BPP. We then consider the presence of noise in the quantum simulator in the form of additional geometrically-local Linbdladian terms. We show that the simulation tasks considered in this paper are stable to errors, i.e. they can be solved to a noise-limited, but system-size independent, precision. Finally, we establish that, assuming BQP $\neq$ BPP, there are stable geometrically local Lindbladian simulation problems such that as the noise rate on the simulator is reduced, classical algorithms must take time superpolynomially longer in the inverse noise rate to attain the same precision as the analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning in weakly-dissipative quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning for analog quantum simulation from non-equilibrium quench dynamics in the limit of weakly dissipative many-body systems. We present and compare various methods and strategies to learn the operator content of the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operators of the Liouvillian. We compare different ans\"atze based on an experimentally accessible "learning error" which we consider as a function of the number of runs of the experiment. Initially, the learning error decreases with the inverse square root of the number of runs, as the error in the reconstructed parameters is dominated by shot noise. Eventually the learning error remains constant, allowing us to recognize missing ansatz terms. A central aspect of our approaches is to (re-)parametrize ans\"atze by introducing and varying the dependencies between parameters. This allows us to identify the relevant parameters of the system, thereby reducing the complexity of the learning task. Importantly, this (re-)parametrization relies solely on classical post-processing, which is compelling given the finite amount of data available from experiments. We illustrate and compare our methods with two experimentally relevant spin models.</description>

      <title>Optical transition parameters of the silicon T centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The silicon T centre's narrow, telecommunications-band optical emission, long spin coherence, and direct photonic integration have spurred interest in this emitter as a spin-photon interface for distributed quantum computing and networking. However, key parameters of the T centre's spin-selective optical transitions remain undetermined or ambiguous in literature. In this paper we present a Hamiltonian of the T centre TX state and determine key parameters of the optical transition from T$_0$ to TX$_0$ from a combined analysis of published results, density functional theory, and new spectroscopy. We resolve ambiguous values of the internal defect potential in the literature, and we present the first measurements of electrically tuned T centre emission. As a result, we provide a model of the T centre's optical and spin properties under strain, electric, and magnetic fields that can be utilized for realizing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of ultrafast singlet fission in 1D rings towards unit efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is an electronic transition that in the last decade has been under the spotlight for its applications in optoelectronics, from photovoltaics to spintronics. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical advancements, optimising SF in materials like multichromophoric systems and molecular crystals remains a challenge, due to the complexity of its analysis beyond perturbative methods. Here, we tackle the case of 1D rings, aiming to promote singlet fission and prevent its back-reaction. We study ultrafast SF non-perturbatively, by numerically solving a spin-boson model, via exact propagation and tensor network methods. By optimising over a parameter space relevant to organic molecular materials, we identify two classes of solutions that can take SF efficiency beyond 85% in the non-dissipative (coherent) regime, and to 99% when exciton-phonon interactions can be tuned. After discussing the experimental feasibility of the optimised solutions, we conclude by proposing that this approach can be extended to a wider class of optoelectronic optimisation problems.</description>

      <title>Inevitable Negativity: Additivity Commands Negative Quantum Channel Entropy</title>

Abstract: Quantum channels represent a broad spectrum of operations crucial to quantum information theory, encompassing everything from the transmission of quantum information to the manipulation of various resources. In the domain of states, the concept of majorization serves as a fundamental tool for comparing the uncertainty inherent in both classical and quantum systems. This paper establishes a rigorous framework for assessing the uncertainty in both classical and quantum channels. By employing a specific class of superchannels, we introduce and elucidate three distinct approaches to channel majorization: constructive, axiomatic, and operational. Intriguingly, these methodologies converge to a consistent ordering. This convergence not only provides a robust basis for defining entropy functions for channels but also clarifies the interpretation of entropy in this broader context. Most notably, our findings reveal that any viable entropy function for quantum channels must assume negative values, thereby challenging traditional notions of entropy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic thermalization on noisy quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxation after a global quench is a natural way to probe thermalization in closed quantum systems. When a system relaxes after the quench, thermal observables emerge in the absence of constraints, provided long-time averaging or a large system. We demonstrate a thermalization mechanism based on averaging the observables over realizations of a global quench protocol that does not rely on a system's size or long-time evolution. The quench abruptly establishes all-to-all couplings of random strength in a few-body system and initializes the dynamics. Shortly after the quench, the observables averaged over realizations of random couplings become stationary. The average occupation probabilities of many-body energy states equilibrate toward the Gibbs distribution with a finite positive or negative absolute temperature that depends on the initial state's energy, with the negative temperatures occurring due to the confined spectrum of the system. Running an experiment on an IBM Quantum computer (IBMQ) for four qubits, we report the utility of the digital quantum computer for predicting thermal observables and their fluctuations for positive or negative absolute temperatures. Implementing thermalization on IBMQ, this result facilitates probing the dynamical emergence of thermal equilibrium and, consequently, equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in the Quantum Capacity of Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the capacities of quantum channels is one of the fundamental problems of quantum information theory. This problem is extremely challenging and technically difficult, allowing only lower and upper bounds to be calculated for certain types of channels. In this paper, we prove that every quantum channel $\Lambda$ in arbitrary dimension, when contaminated by white noise in the form $\Lambda_x(\rho)=(1-x)\Lambda(\rho)+x\tr(\rho) \frac{I}{d}$, completely loses its capacity of transmitting quantum states when $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$, no matter what type of encoding and decoding is used. In other words, the quantum capacity of the channel vanishes in this region. To show this, we find a channel ${\cal N}_x$, which anti-degrades the depolarizing channel when $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$. We also find the quantum capacity of the complement of the depolarizing channel in closed form. Besides the erasure channel, this is the only example of a parameteric channel in arbitrary dimension for which the quantum capacity has been calculated in closed form.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the coupling of photon spin with rotation in connection with a recent proposal of Fedderke et al.

To this end, we analyze the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in a physical system that uniformly rotates about the direction of wave propagation in the presence of an ambient medium. Finally, we consider the possibility of using this type of spin-of-light gyroscope to measure gravitomagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation with Space Contributions Embedded in a Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac equation is considered with the recently proposed generalized gravitational interaction (Kepler or Coulomb), which includes post-Newtonian (relativistic) and quantum corrections to the classical potential. The general idea in choosing the metric is that the spacetime contributions are contained in an external potential or in an electromagnetic potential which can be considered as a good basis for future studies of quantum physics in space. The forms considered for the scalar potential and the so-called vector (magnetic) potential, can be viewed as the multipole expansion of these terms and therefore the approach includes a simultaneous study of multipole expansions to both fields. We also discuss several known generalizations of the Coulomb potential within this formulation in terms of certain Heun functions. The impossibility of solving our equation for the quantum-corrected Coulomb terms using known exact or quasi-exact nonperturbative analytical techniques is discussed, and finally the Bethe-ansatz approach is proposed to overcome this challenging problem.</description>

      <title>GALIC: Hybrid Multi-Qubitwise Pauli Grouping for Quantum Computing Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observable estimation is a core primitive in NISQ-era algorithms targeting quantum chemistry applications. To reduce the state preparation overhead required for accurate estimation, recent works have proposed various simultaneous measurement schemes to lower estimator variance. Two primary grouping schemes have been proposed: fully commutativity (FC) and qubit-wise commutativity (QWC), with no compelling means of interpolation. In this work we propose a generalized framework for designing and analyzing context-aware hybrid FC/QWC commutativity relations. We use our framework to propose a noise-and-connectivity aware grouping strategy: Generalized backend-Aware pauLI Commutation (GALIC). We demonstrate how GALIC interpolates between FC and QWC, maintaining estimator accuracy in Hamiltonian estimation while lowering variance by an average of 20\% compared to QWC. We also explore the design space of near-term quantum devices using the GALIC framework, specifically comparing device noise levels and connectivity. We find that error suppression has a more than $10\times$ larger impact on device-aware estimator variance than qubit connectivity with even larger correlation differences in estimator biases.</description>

This study examines the quantum motion of both point particles and objects, identifying critical parameters for the transition from quantum to classical regimes. By analyzing the system's dynamics, we define the reduction time of the wave function through Bohmian trajectories, introducing a fresh viewpoint in this field. Our findings align with results obtained in standard quantum mechanics, confirming the validity of this approach.</description>

Abstract: We explore the use of fractional control-not gates in quantum thermodynamics. The Nth-root gate allows for a paced application of two-qubit operations. We apply it in quantum thermodynamic protocols for charging a quantum battery. Circuits for three (and two) qubits are analysed by considering the generated ergotropy and other measures of performance. We also perform an optimisation of initial system parameters, e.g. initial quantum coherence of one of the qubits affects strongly the efficiency of protocols and the system's performance as a battery. Finally, we briefly discuss the feasibility for an experimental realisation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying nonclassical correlation via the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical correlation is an important concept in quantum information theory, referring to a special type of correlation that exists between quantum systems, which surpasses the scope of classical physics. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a family of information with important properties, namely the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information, of which the famous quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase skew information are special cases.We classify the local observables in the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information into two categories (i.e., orthonormal bases and a Hermitian operator with a fixed nondegenerate spectrum), and based on this, we propose two different forms of indicators to quantify nonclassical correlation of bipartite quantum states. We have not only investigated some important properties of these two kinds of indicators but also illustrated through specific examples that they can indeed capture some nonclassical correlation. Furthermore, we find that these two types of indicators reduce to entanglement measure for bipartite pure states. Specifically, we also derive the relationship between these two indicators and the entanglement measure $I$-concurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum computation, identifying key elements that enable a quantum computational advantage is a long-standing issue. Starting from the standard results on the necessity of Wigner negativity, we develop a comprehensive and versatile framework that not only enables the identification of a potential quantum computational advantage, but also allows to pinpoint the contribution of each quantum gate in achieving this objective. As such, it can be straightforwardly applied to current continuous-variables quantum circuits, while also constraining the tolerable amount of losses above which any potential quantum advantage can be ruled out. We use $(s)$-ordered quasiprobability distributions on phase-space to capture the non-classical features in the protocol, and focus our model entirely on the ordering parameter $s$. This allows us to highlight the resourcefulness and robustness to loss of a universal set of unitary gates comprising three distinct Gaussian gates, and a fourth one, the cubic gate, providing important insight on the role of non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems, which interact with external environments, presents significant challenges on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices due to limited qubit resources and noise. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for simulating open quantum systems on NISQ hardware by leveraging a time-perturbative Kraus operator representation of the system's dynamics. Our approach avoids the computationally expensive Trotterization method and exploits the Lindblad master equation to represent time evolution in a compact form, particularly for systems satisfying specific commutation relations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by simulating quantum channels, such as the continuous-time Pauli channel and damped harmonic oscillators, on NISQ trapped-ion hardware, including IonQ Harmony and Quantinuum H1-1. Additionally, we introduce hardware-agnostic error mitigation techniques, including Pauli channel fitting and quantum depolarizing channel inversion, to enhance the fidelity of quantum simulations. Our results show strong agreement between the simulations on real quantum hardware and exact solutions, highlighting the potential of Kraus-based methods for scalable and accurate simulation of open quantum systems on NISQ devices. This framework opens pathways for simulating more complex systems under realistic conditions in the near term.</description>

      <title>Monogamy of Entanglement Bounds and Improved Approximation Algorithms for Qudit Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new monogamy of entanglement bounds for 2-local qudit Hamiltonian of rank-one projectors without local terms. In particular, we certify the ground state energy in terms of the maximum matching of the underlying interaction graph via low-degree sum-of-squares proofs. Algorithmically, we show that a simple matching-based algorithm approximates the ground state energy to at least $1/d$ for general graphs and to at least $1/d + \Theta(1/D)$ for graphs with bounded degree, $D$. This outperforms random assignment, which, in expectation, achieves energy of only $1/d^2$ of the ground state energy for general graphs. Notably, on $D$-regular graphs with degree, $D \leq 5$, and for any local dimension, $d$, we show that this simple matching-based algorithm has an approximation guarantee of $1/2$. Lastly, when $d=2$, we present an algorithm achieving an approximation guarantee of $0.595$, beating that of [PT22, arXiv:2206.08342] (which gave a tight approximation guarantee of $1/2$).</description>

      <title>The Learning Stabilizers with Noise problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random classical codes have good error correcting properties, and yet they are notoriously hard to decode in practice. Despite many decades of extensive study, the fastest known algorithms still run in exponential time. The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, which can be seen as the task of decoding a random linear code in the presence of noise, has thus emerged as a prominent hardness assumption with numerous applications in both cryptography and learning theory.
  Is there a natural quantum analog of the LPN problem? In this work, we introduce the Learning Stabilizers with Noise (LSN) problem, the task of decoding a random stabilizer code in the presence of local depolarizing noise. We give both polynomial-time and exponential-time quantum algorithms for solving LSN in various depolarizing noise regimes, ranging from extremely low noise, to low constant noise rates, and even higher noise rates up to a threshold. Next, we provide concrete evidence that LSN is hard. First, we show that LSN includes LPN as a special case, which suggests that it is at least as hard as its classical counterpart. Second, we prove a worst-case to average-case reduction for variants of LSN. We then ask: what is the computational complexity of solving LSN? Because the task features quantum inputs, its complexity cannot be characterized by traditional complexity classes. Instead, we show that the LSN problem lies in a recently introduced (distributional and oracle) unitary synthesis class. Finally, we identify several applications of our LSN assumption, ranging from the construction of quantum bit commitment schemes to the computational limitations of learning from quantum data.</description>

      <title>Untrained Filtering with Trained Focusing for Superior Quantum Architecture Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) represents a fundamental challenge in quantum machine learning. Unlike previous methods that treat it as a static search process, from a perspective on QAS as an item retrieval task in vast search space, we decompose the search process into dynamic alternating phases of coarse and fine-grained knowledge learning. We propose quantum untrained-explored synergistic trained architecture (QUEST-A),a framework through coarse-grained untrained filtering for rapid search space reduction and fine-grained trained focusing for precise space refinement in progressive QAS. QUEST-A develops an evolutionary mechanism with knowledge accumulation and reuse to enhance multi-level knowledge transfer in architecture searching. Experiments demonstrate QUEST-A's superiority over existing methods: enhancing model expressivity in signal representation, maintaining high performance across varying complexities in image classification, and achieving order-of-magnitude precision improvements in variational quantum eigensolver tasks, providing a transferable methodology for QAS.</description>

      <title>Fast Unconditional Reset and Leakage Reduction of a Tunable Superconducting Qubit via an Engineered Dissipative Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate initialization of qubits, reset, is a crucial building block for various tasks in quantum information processing, such as quantum error-correction and estimation of statistics of noisy quantum devices with many qubits. We demonstrate unconditional reset of a frequency-tunable transmon qubit that simultaneously resets multiple excited states by utilizing a metamaterial waveguide engineered to provide a cold bath over a wide spectral range, while providing strong protection against Purcell decay of the qubit. We report reset error below 0.13% (0.16%) when prepared in the first (second) excited state of the transmon within 88ns. Additionally, through the sharp roll-off in the density of states of the metamaterial waveguide, we implement a leakage reduction unit that selectively resets the transmon's second excited state to 0.285(3)% residual population within 44ns while acting trivially in the computational subspace as an identity operation that preserves encoded information with an infidelity of 0.72(1)%.</description>

      <title>Architectures for Heterogeneous Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for future quantum computers due to its ability to exponentially suppress physical errors. The surface code is a leading error-correcting code candidate because of its local topological structure, experimentally achievable thresholds, and support for universal gate operations with magic states. However, its physical overhead scales quadratically with number of correctable errors. Conversely, quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes offer superior scaling but lack, on their own, a clear path to universal logical computation. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly evident is becoming that there are significant advantages to designing architectures using multiple codes. Heterogeneous architectures provide a clear path to universal logical computation as well as the ability to access different resource trade offs. To address this, we propose integrating the surface code and gross code using an ancilla bus for inter-code data movement. This approach involves managing trade-offs, including qubit overhead, a constrained instruction set, and gross code (memory) routing and management. While our focus is on the gross-surface code architecture, our method is adaptable to any code combination and the constraints generated by that specific architecture. Motivated by the potential reduction of physical qubit overhead, an ever important feature in the realization of fault tolerant computation, we perform the first full system study of heterogeneous error-correcting codes, discovering architectural trade-offs and optimizing around them. We demonstrate physical qubit reductions of up to 6.42x when executing an algorithm to a specific logical error rate, at the cost of up to a 3.43x increase in execution time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resources like entanglement and magic are essential for characterizing the complexity of quantum states. However, when the number of copies of quantum states and the computational time are limited by numbers polynomial in the system size $n$, accurate estimation of the amount of these resources becomes difficult. This makes it impossible to distinguish between ensembles of states with relatively small resources and one that has nearly maximal resources. Such ensembles with small resources are referred to as "pseudo-quantum" ensembles. Recent studies have introduced an ensemble known as the random subset phase state ensemble, which is pseudo-entangled, pseudo-magical, and pseudorandom. While the current state-of-the-art implementation of this ensemble is conjectured to be realized by a circuit with $O(nt)$ depth, it is still too deep for near-term quantum devices to execute for small $t$. In addition, the strict linear dependence on $t$ has only been established as a lower bound on the circuit depth. In this work, we present significantly improved implementations that only require $\omega(\log n)\cdot O(t[\log t]^2)$ depth circuits, which almost saturates the theoretical lower bound. This is also the fastest known for generating pseudorandom states to the best of our knowledge. We believe that our findings will facilitate the implementation of pseudo-ensembles on near-term devices, allowing executions of tasks that would otherwise require ensembles with maximal quantum resources, by generating pseudo-ensembles at a super-polynomially fewer number of entangling and non-Clifford gates.</description>

      <title>Bell state generation and CNOT operation using on-demand identical photons from shape-controlled spatially ordered quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault tolerant on-chip photonic quantum computation is enormously helped by (a) deterministic generation of the needed thousands to millions of photon qubits from (b) quantum emitters in designed spatially ordered arrays to enable networks for implementing many-qubit logic circuits. Scaling up photonic quantum information processing systems has, however, been prevented by the lack of such quantum emitters until the demonstration of the platform of mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) -- controlled shape, size, and volume single QD -- located in designed regular arrays. Here we demonstrate 2 qubit CNOT gate operation -- a universal gate necessary to enable quantum circuits of arbitrary complexity -- in polarization basis using photons emitted from individual MTSQDs. A Bell state fidelity of 0.825$\pm$0.010 is achieved with two photon interference (TPI) visibility of 0.947$\pm$0.0015 at 4K without Purcell enhancement. The results make a strong case for developing MTSQD arrays for utility scale optical quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a unique correlation phenomenon in quantum mechanics, and the measurement of quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum computing and quantum communication. Many mainstream entanglement criteria and measurement methods currently known have shortcomings in certain aspects, such as not being sufficient or necessary conditions for entanglement, or only being effective in simple cases such as 2-qubits or pure states. In this work, we will propose a scheme for measuring quantum entanglement, which starts with treating the set of quantum separable states as a convex hull of quantum separable pure states, and analyzes the properties of the convex hull to obtain a new form of entanglement measurement. Although a large amount of data is required in the measurement process, this method is not only applicable to 2-qubit quantum states, but also a entanglement measurement method that can be applied to any dimension and any fragment. We will provide several examples to compare their results with other entanglement metrics and entanglement determination methods to verify their feasibility.</description>

Abstract: Schmidt decomposition is a powerful tool in quantum information. While Schmidt decomposition is universal for bipartite states, its not for multipartite states. In this article, we review properties of bipartite Schmidt decompositions and study which of them extend to multipartite states. In particular, Schmidt number (the number of non-zero terms in Schmidt decomposition) define an equivalence class using separable unitary transforms. We show that it is NP-complete to partition a multipartite state that attains the highest Schmidt number. In addition, we observe that purifications of a density matrix of a composite system preserves Schmidt decomposability.</description>

      <title>Matrix hypercontractivity, streaming algorithms and LDCs: the large alphabet case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.02600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions defined over large alphabets. In order to do so, we prove a generalization of the powerful $2$-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of Ball, Carlen, Lieb (Inventiones Mathematicae'94). Using our hypercontractive~inequality, we present upper and lower bounds for the communication complexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem defined over large alphabets. We then consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games on a hypergraph with $t$-size hyperedges. By using our communication lower bound, we show that every streaming algorithm in the adversarial model achieving an $(r-\varepsilon)$-approximation of this value requires $\Omega(n^{1-2/t})$ quantum space, where $r$ is the alphabet size. We next present a lower bound for locally decodable codes (LDC) $\mathbb{Z}_r^n\to \mathbb{Z}_r^N$ over large alphabets with recoverability probability at least $1/r + \varepsilon$. Using hypercontractivity, we give an exponential lower bound $N = 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^4 n/r^4)}$ for $2$-query (possibly non-linear) LDCs over $\mathbb{Z}_r$ and using the non-commutative Khintchine inequality we prove an improved lower bound of $N = 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^2 n/r^2)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of SO($n$)-symmetric spin chains which generalize the transverse-field Ising chain for $n=1$. These spin chains are defined with Gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to $n$ species of itinerant Majorana fermions coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Their phase diagrams include a critical point described by the $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_{1}$ conformal field theory as well as two distinct gapped phases. We show that one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a symmetry-protected topological phase when $n \geq 2$. These two gapped phases are proved to be related to each other by a Kramers-Wannier duality. Furthermore, other elegant structures in the transverse-field Ising chain, such as the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra, also carry over to our models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Synchronization in Presence of Shot Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a widespread phenomenon encountered in many natural and engineered systems with nonlinear classical dynamics. How synchronization concepts and mechanisms transfer to the quantum realm and whether features are universal or platform specific are timely questions of fundamental interest. Here, we present a new approach to model incoherently driven dissipative quantum systems susceptible to synchronization within the framework of Josephson photonics devices, where a dc-biased Josephson junction creates (non-classical) light in a microwave cavity. The combined quantum compound constitutes a self-sustained oscillator with a neutrally stable phase. Linking current noise to the full counting statistics of photon emission allows us to capture phase diffusion, but moreover permits phase locking to an ac-signal and mutual synchronization of two such devices. Thereby one can observe phase stabilization leading to a sharp emission spectrum as well as unique photon emission statistics revealing shot noise induced phase slips. Two-time perturbation theory is used to obtain a reduced description of the oscillators phase dynamics in form of a Fokker-Planck equation in generalization of classical synchronization theories.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

Abstract: Placing a black hole in a cavity provides a natural framework for exploring gravitational scales, thermodynamic instabilities, and effective gravity theories. In this paper, we examine the evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in a two-sided extension of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. By introducing a reflecting boundary in the eternal black hole exteriors, we regulate the infrared modes of Hawking radiation, finding that the entanglement entropy eventually saturates at a constant value. This value can be lower than the black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus avoiding the Page formulation of the information paradox. Regarding entanglement islands, we identify a universal effect induced by the boundary, which we term the ``blinking island'' -- where the entanglement island temporarily disappears, resulting in a short-time information paradox.</description>

      <title>Optimized Current Density Reconstruction from Widefield Quantum Diamond Magnetic Field Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Diamond Microscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defects in diamond crystals has enabled the magnetic field imaging of a wide variety of nanoscale current profiles. Intimately linked with the imaging process is the problem of reconstructing the current density, which provides critical insight into the structure under study. This manifests as a non-trivial inverse problem of current reconstruction from noisy data, typically conducted via Fourier-based approaches. Learning algorithms and Bayesian methods have been proposed as novel alternatives for inference-based reconstructions. We study the applicability of Fourier-based and Bayesian methods for reconstructing two-dimensional current density maps from magnetic field images obtained from NV imaging. We discuss extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the performance of the reconstruction algorithms in various parameter regimes, and further validate our analysis via performing reconstructions on experimental data. Finally, we examine parameter regimes that favor specific reconstruction algorithms and provide an empirical approach for selecting regularization in Bayesian methods.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Quantum Mechanics: The Birth and Evolution of the Many-Worlds Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Many-worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics has captivated physicists and philosophers alike since its inception in the mid-20th century. This paper explores the historical roots, evolution, and implications of the MWI within the context of quantum theory. Beginning with an overview of early developments in quantum mechanics and the emergence of foundational interpretations, we delve into the origins of the MWI through the groundbreaking work of physicist Hugh Everett III. Everett's doctoral thesis proposed a radical solution to the measurement problem, positing the existence of multiple branching universes to account for quantum phenomenon. We trace the evolution of the MWI, examining its refinement and elaboration by subsequent physicists such as John Wheeler. Furthermore, we discuss the MWI's impact on contemporary physics, including its connections to quantum information theory and ongoing experimental tests. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the MWI's historical development and current relevance, this paper offers insights into one of the most provocative interpretations of quantum mechanics and its implications for our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of relativistic vortex electrons in external laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the interactions of vortex electrons with electromagnetic fields is crucial for advancing particle acceleration techniques, scattering theory in background fields, and developing novel electron beams for material diagnostics. In this work, we systematically study the dynamics of relativistic vortex electrons during their head-on collisions with linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses, as well as their superposition. We develop a theoretical framework using Volkov-Bessel wave functions to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of vortex electrons in these external fields. We show that the beam center of the vortex electron follows the classical trajectory of a point-charge electron while maintaining the transverse structure of both vortex eigenstates and superposition states. Specifically, CP laser pulses cause the beam center to rotate, while LP laser pulses induce a lateral shift. The combined effect of LP and CP laser pulses in a two-mode field results in a twisted spiral pattern. Our findings demonstrate the potential for versatile control of vortex electron beams using various laser modes, providing a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies. This work serves as a benchmark reference for investigations into the manipulation of vortex electron beams using more realistic laser or other types of external fields.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing quantum-spin systems on a two-dimensional square lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by the Floquet engineering using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-K\"ahler description, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the G-field, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remains second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Squeezing atomic $p$-orbital condensates for detecting gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision gravitational wave measurement transforms research beyond general relativity and cosmology. Advances are made by applying quantum enhanced interferometry into the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors. Here, we develop an atomic sensor that employs a $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice to project gravitational wave signals into an orbital squeezed state. This entangled state couples linearly to the spacetime distortion signals received via a Michelson interferometer. Simulation data show that this sensor improves sensitivity over LIGO's quantum noise by approximately one order of magnitude and detection volume by $\sim 10^3$ in key frequency regimes. Additionally, it reduces the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. These results suggest that atomic orbital squeezing offers a compelling alternative to conventional techniques, offering a qualitatively different avenue for gravitational wave-based detection of dark matter, black holes, and the equation of state in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The horocycle regulator: exact cutoff-independence in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the entanglement entropy of a single subregion in quantum field theory is formally infinite and requires regularization, certain combinations of entropies are perfectly finite in the limit that the regulator is removed, the mutual information being a common example. For generic regulator schemes, such as a holographic calculation with a uniform radial cutoff, these quantities show non-trivial dependence on the regulator at finite values of the cutoff. We investigate a holographic regularization scheme defined in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space constructed from \textit{horocycles}, curves in two-dimensional hyperbolic space perpendicular to all geodesics approaching a single point on the boundary, that leads to finite information measures that are \textit{totally} cutoff-independent, even at finite values of the regulator. We describe a broad class of such information measures, and describe how the field theory dual to the horocycle regulator is inherently non-local.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>
