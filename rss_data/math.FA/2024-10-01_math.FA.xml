      <description>arXiv:2409.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a follow-up to arXiv:2304.04373. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for weighted Orlicz-Poincar\'e inequalities in product spaces. These results follow the work of Chua and Wheeden, who established similar results for weighted Poincar\'e inequalities in product spaces.</description>

      <title>A Toeplitz-like operator with rational matrix symbol having poles on the unit circle:\ Matrix representation and spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of unbounded Toeplitz operators with rational matrix symbols that have poles on the unit circle and employ state space realization techniques from linear systems theory, as used in our earlier analysis in [11] of this class of operators, to study the connection with semi-infinite Toeplitz matrices and to determine the essential spectrum and resolvent set.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and compactness kernel theorem for $\alpha$-modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establishing the kernel theorems for $\alpha$-modulation spaces in terms of boundedness and compactness. We characterize the boundedness of a linear operator $A$ from an $\alpha$-modulation space $M^p_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into another $\alpha$-modulation space $M^q_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, by the membership of its distributional kernel in mixed $\alpha$-modulation spaces. We also characterize the compactness of $A$ by means of the kernel in a certain closed subspace of mixed $\alpha$-modulation spaces. The proofs are based on the viewpoint that the action of the linear operator on certain function space can be reduced to the action on the suitable atoms of this function space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the de Branges-Rovnyak spaces $\mathcal{H}(B)$ generated by row Schur functions $B$ with mate $a$. We prove that the polynomials are dense in $\mathcal{H}(B)$, and characterize the backward shift invariant subspaces of $\mathcal{H}(B)$. We then describe the cyclic vectors in $\mathcal{H}(B)$ when $B$ is of finite rank and $\dim (aH^2)^\perp &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <title>Increasing sequences in ordered Banach spaces -- new theorems and open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordered Banach space $X$ is said to have the Levi property or to be regular if every increasing order bounded net (equivalently, sequence) is norm convergent. We prove four theorems related to this classical concept:
  (i) The Levi property follows from the - formally weaker - assumption that every increasing net that has a minimal upper bound is norm convergent. This motivates a discussion about in which sense the Levi property resembles the notion of order continuous norm from Banach lattice theory.
  (ii) If $X$ is separable and has normal cone, then the assumption that every increasing order bounded sequence has a supremum implies the Levi property. This generalizes a classical result about Banach lattices, but requires new ideas since one cannot work with disjoint sequences in the proof.
  (iii) A version of Dini's theorem for ordered Banach spaces that is more general than what is typically stated in the literature. We use this to derive a sufficient condition for the space of all compact operators between two Banach lattices to have the Levi property.
  (iv) Dini's theorem never holds on reflexive ordered Banach spaces with non-normal cone - i.e., on such a space one can always find an increasing sequence that converges weakly but not in norm.
  We illustrate our results by various examples and counterexamples and pose four open problems.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is to prove that, given two superreflexive Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, then $X\widehat{\otimes}_\pi Y$ is superreflexive if and only if either $X$ or $Y$ is finite-dimensional. In a similar way, we prove that $X\widehat{\otimes}_\varepsilon Y$ is superreflexive if and only if either $X$ or $Y$ is finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>On integral representation of radial operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize the radial operators on weighted Bergman spaces of Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$, the Dirichlet and the Hardy spaces of the open unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, in terms of integral representations. We also investigate normality, compactness, spectrum and numerical ranges of these operators. Further, utilizing the theory of radial operators, we produce examples of von Neumann algebras of analytic functions on any Reinhardt domain.</description>

      <title>Cyclicity and iterated logarithms in the Dirichlet space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D(\mu)$ denote a harmonically weighted Dirichlet space on the unit disc $\mathbb D$. We show that outer functions $f\in D(\mu)$ are cyclic in $D(\mu)$, whenever $\log f$ belongs to the Pick-Smirnov class $N^+(D(\mu))$. If $f$ has $H^\infty$-norm less than or equal to 1, then cyclicity can also be checked via iterated logarithms. For example, we show that such outer functions $f$ are cyclic, whenever $\log(1+ \log(1/f))\in N^+(D(\mu))$. This condition can be checked by verifying that $\log(1+ \log(1/f))\in D(\mu)$.
  If $f$ satisfies a mild extra condition, then the conditions also become necessary for cyclicity.</description>

      <title>Factorization of positive-semidefinite operators with absolutely summable entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A problem by Feichtinger, Heil, and Larson asks whether a positive-definite integral operator with $M_1$ kernel admits a symmetric rank-one decomposition which is strongly square-summable with respect to the $M_1$ norm. In conjunction with a concurrent result by Bandeira-Mixon-Steinerberger, we provide a negative answer to the problem and study special cases where such factorization is possible. We also discuss an application of the results to the semidefinite relaxation of a quadratic program.</description>

      <title>Coarse pseudo-differential calculus and index theory on manifolds with a tangent Lie structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified (coarse) version of pseudo-differential calculus for operators of order zero on complete Riemannian manifolds. This calculus works for the usual Hormander (1,0) class of operators, as well as for pseudo-differential operators on filtered manifolds. In fact, we develop the coarse PDO calculus on a more general class of manifolds which we call manifolds with a tangent Lie structure. We prove an index theorem for `hypoelliptic' operators where the index is not just an integer, but an element of the K-homology group of the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cost functions considered are $c(x,y)=h(x-y)$, with $h\in C^2(R^n)$, homogeneous of degree $p\geq 2$, with positive definite Hessian in the unit sphere. We consider monotone maps $T$ concerning that cost and establish local $L^\infty$-estimates of $T$ minus affine functions, which are applied to obtain differentiability properties of $T$ a.e. It is also shown that these maps are related to maps of bounded deformation, and further, differentiability and H\"older continuity properties are derived.</description>

      <title>Convex bodies with algebraic section volume functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The section volume function $A_K(\xi,t), \ \xi \in \mathbb R^n, \ t \in \mathbb R,$ of a body $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ evaluates the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the cross-section $K$ by the hyperplane $\{ x \cdot \xi=t \}.$ We are concerned with the question: can the shape of a body $K$ be detected from an algebraic type of its section function? We prove that among strictly convex bodies $K$ with $C^{\infty}$ boundaries, ellipsoids are completely described by the algebraic equation $qA_K^m+p=0,$ where $m \in \mathbb N$ and $q=q(\xi), \ p=p(\xi,t)$ are polynomials. The result is motivated by Arnold's problem on algebraically integrable domains (which, in turn, has its roots in Newton's Lemma about ovals) and generalizes known results on polynomially integrable domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n \ge 2$ and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. In this article, we establish first-order global regularity estimates in the scale of BMO spaces on $\Omega$ for weak solutions to the second-order elliptic equation $\mathrm{div}(A \nabla u) = \mathrm{div} , \boldsymbol{f}$ in $\Omega$. This is achieved under minimal regularity assumptions on $\Omega$ and the coefficient matrix $A$, utilizing the pointwise multiplier characterization of the BMO space on $\Omega$. As an application, we also obtain global estimates of $\nabla u$ in the Lebesgue space $L^1(\Omega)$ when $\boldsymbol{f}$ belongs to the Hardy space on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst-case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize Bounded Mean Oscillation (BMO) and establish their connection with Hankel operators on weighted Bergman spaces over tubular domains. By utilizing the space BMO, we provide a new characterization of Bloch spaces on tubular domains. Next, we define a modified projection operator and prove its boundedness. Furthermore, we introduce differential operators and demonstrate that these operators belong to Lebesgue spaces on tubular domains. Finally, we establish an integral representation for Bergman functions using these differential operators.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to define Toeplitz operators between K\"othe spaces, especially power series spaces. We determine the conditions for continuity and compactness of these operators. We define the concept of S-tameness of a family of continuous operators. We construct some conditions on S-tameness for the families consisting of Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operators carrying disjoint bounded subsets of a Banach lattice into compact, weakly compact, and limited subsets of a Banach space. Surprisingly, these operators behave differently with classical compact, weakly compact, and limited operators. We introduce and investigate d-Andrews operators which carry disjoint bounded sets onto Dunford--Pettis sets.</description>

Abstract: This paper is about the operators defined between K\"othe spaces whose associated matrix is a Hankel matrix. After demonstrating how these operators are defined, the conditions for continuity and compactness of these operators are constructed. It is shown that the backward and forward shift operators are mean ergodic and Ces\`aro bounded by establishing a relationship between the backward and forward shift operators and Hankel and Toeplitz operators on power series spaces.</description>

      <title>Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms and associated $p$-energy measures on fractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct good $p$-energy forms on metric measure spaces as pointwise subsequential limits of Besov-type $p$-energy functionals under certain geometric/analytic conditions. Such forms are often called Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms in the literature. As an advantage of our approach, the associated $p$-energy measures are obtained and investigated. We also prove that our construction is applicable to the settings of Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and Cao-Gu-Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517], yields Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms comparable to the $p$-energy forms constructed in these papers, and can be further modified in the case of self-similar sets to obtain self-similar $p$-energy forms keeping most of the good properties of Korevaar-Schoen ones.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of Fourier multipliers using the spherical Fourier transform on Gelfand pairs. We refer to them as spherical Fourier multipliers. We study certain sufficient conditions under which they are bounded. Then, under the hypothesis of compactness of the underlying group and under certain summability conditions, we obtain the belonging of the spherical Fourier multipliers to some Schatten-von Neumann classes.</description>

Abstract: We provide new characterizations of Sobolev spaces that are true under some mild conditions. We study modified first order Sobolev spaces on metric measure spaces: $\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space, $\hat{\mathrm{TC}}$-Newtonian space, and Gigli-like space. We prove that if the measure is Borel regular and $\sigma$-finite, then the modified $\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space is equivalent to the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space. Moreover, if additionally the measure is doubling then all modified spaces are equivalent to the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general theory of greedy approximation with respect to arbitrary dictionaries is well developed in the case of real Banach spaces. Recently, some of results proved for the Weak Chebyshev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in the case of real Banach spaces were extended to the case of complex Banach spaces. In this paper we extend some of known in the real case results for other than WCGA greedy algorithms to the case of complex Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Some Notes on Quantitative Generalized CLTs with Self-Decomposable Limiting Laws by Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these notes, we obtain new stability estimates for centered non-degenerate selfdecomposable probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite second moment and for non-degenerate symmetric $\alpha$-stable probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\alpha \in [1,2)$. These new results are refinements of the corresponding ones available in the literature. The proofs are based on Stein's method for self-decomposable laws, recently developed in a series of papers, and on closed forms techniques together with a new ingredient: weighted Poincar\'e-type inequalities. As applications, rates of convergence in Wasserstein-type distances are computed for several instances of the generalized central limit theorems (CLTs). In particular, a $n^{1-2/\alpha}$-rate is obtained in $1$-Wasserstein distance when the target law is a non-degenerate symmetric $\alpha$-stable one with $\alpha \in (1,2)$. Finally, the non-degenerate symmetric Cauchy case is studied at length from a spectral point of view. At last, in this Cauchy situation, a $n^{-1}$-rate of convergence is obtained when the initial law is a certain instance of layered stable distributions.</description>

      <title>Condenser capacities and capacitary potentials for unbounded sets, and global $p$-harmonic Green functions on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the condenser capacity $\mathrm{cap}_p(E,\Omega)$ on \emph{unbounded} open sets $\Omega$ in a proper connected metric space $X$ equipped with a locally doubling measure supporting a local $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, where $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Using a new definition of capacitary potentials, we show that $\mathrm{cap}_p$ is countably subadditive and that it is a Choquet capacity. We next obtain formulas for the capacity of superlevel sets for the capacitary potential. These are then used to show that $p$-harmonic Green functions exist in an unbounded domain $\Omega$ if and only if either $X$ is $p$-hyperbolic or the Sobolev capacity $C_p(X\setminus \Omega)&gt;0$. As an application, we deduce new results for Perron solutions and boundary regularity for the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $p$-harmonic functions in unbounded open sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a compactness result related to $G$-convergence for autonomous evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. Compared to previous work related to applications, we do not require any boundedness or regularity of the underlying spatial domain; nor do we assume any periodicity or ergodicity assumption on the potentially oscillatory part. In terms of abstract evolutionary equations, we remove any compactness assumptions of the resolvent modulo kernel of the spatial operator. To achieve the results, we introduced a slightly more general class of material laws. As a by-product, we also provide a criterion for $G$-convergence for time-dependent equations solely in terms of static equations.</description>

      <title>The von Neumann extension theory for abstract Friedrichs operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of abstract Friedrichs operators was introduced some fifteen years ago with the aim of providing a more comprehensive framework for the study of positive symmetric systems of first-order partial differential equations, nowadays better known as (classical) Friedrichs systems. Since then, the theory has not only been frequently applied in numerical and analytical research of Friedrichs systems, but has continued to evolve as well. In this paper, we provide an explicit characterisation and a classification of abstract Friedrichs operators. More precisely, we show that every abstract Friedrichs operator can be written as the sum of a skew-symmetric operator and a bounded self-adjoint strictly positive operator. Furthermore, we develop a classification of realisations of abstract Friedrichs operators in the spirit of the von Neumann extension theory, which, when applied to the symmetric case, extends the classical theory.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs of existence and stability of solitary waves in the Whitham and capillary-gravity Whitham equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in both the Whitham and the capillary-gravity Whitham equations. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of stable {solitary waves} in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). Moreover, we provide an existence proof for a branch of solitary waves in the case $T=0$ via a rigorous continuation in the wave velocity. The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rigidity properties for von Neumann algebraic graph products. We introduce the notion of rigid graphs and define a class of II$_1$-factors named $\mathcal{C}_{\rm Rigid}$. For von Neumann algebras in this class we show a unique rigid graph product decomposition. In particular, we obtain unique prime factorization results and unique free product decomposition results for new classes of von Neumann algebras. Furthermore, we show that for many graph products of II$_1$-factors, including the hyperfinite II$_1$-factor, we can, up to a constant 2, retrieve the radius of the graph from the graph product. We also prove several technical results concerning relative amenability and embeddings of (quasi)-normalizers in graph products. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for a graph product to be nuclear and characterize strong solidity, primeness and free-indecomposability for graph products.</description>
