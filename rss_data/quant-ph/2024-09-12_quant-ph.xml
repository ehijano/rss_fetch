      <title>Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits -- where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations -- are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state or, more generally, an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, in order to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit with finite recurrence time. With the aid of a suitable classical limit, we diagnose the control transition to be in a nonequilibrium universality class with dynamical exponent $z&lt;1$ that persists upon reintroducing quantum fluctuations. In the quantum limit, an entanglement transition additionally emerges that coincides with the control transition -- to within our numerical resolution. Both transitions exhibit a dynamical criticality consistent with recent results on measurement-induced phase transitions in power-law interacting circuits. We attribute this feature and the apparent coincidence of the control and entanglement transitions to the global nature of the control.</description>

      <title>State estimation with quantum extreme learning machines beyond the scrambling time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) leverage untrained quantum dynamics to efficiently process information encoded in input quantum states, avoiding the high computational cost of training more complicated nonlinear models. On the other hand, quantum information scrambling (QIS) quantifies how the spread of quantum information into correlations makes it irretrievable from local measurements. Here, we explore the tight relation between QIS and the predictive power of QELMs. In particular, we show efficient state estimation is possible even beyond the scrambling time, for many different types of dynamics -- in fact, we show that in all the cases we studied, the reconstruction efficiency at long interaction times matches the optimal one offered by random global unitary dynamics. These results offer promising venues for robust experimental QELM-based state estimation protocols, as well as providing novel insights into the nature of QIS from a state estimation perspective.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Break-Even for the Compact Fermionic Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utility of solving the Fermi-Hubbard model has been estimated in the billions of dollars. Digital quantum computers can in principle address this task, but have so far been limited to quasi one-dimensional models. This is because of exponential overheads caused by the interplay of noise and the non-locality of the mapping between fermions and qubits. Here, we show experimentally that a recently developed local encoding can overcome this problem. We develop a new compilation scheme, called "corner hopping", that reduces the cost of simulating fermionic hopping by 42% which allows us to conduct the largest digital quantum simulations of a fermionic model to date, using a trapped ion quantum computer to prepare adiabatically the ground state of a 6 x 6 spinless Fermi-Hubbard model encoded in 48 physical qubits. We also develop two new error mitigation schemes for systems with conserved quantities, one based on local postselection and one on extrapolation of local observables. Our results suggest that Fermi-Hubbard models beyond classical simulability can be addressed by digital quantum computers without large increases in gate fidelity.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Deep-Cryogenic Temperature Sensor in CMOS Technology for Quantum Computing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip thermometry at deep-cryogenic temperatures is vital in quantum computing applications to accurately quantify the effect of increased temperature on qubit performance and to implement real-time thermal management on quantum processors. In this work, we present a sub-1K temperature sensor in CMOS technology based on the temperature dependence of the critical current of a superconducting (SC) thin-film. The sensor is implemented in 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) technology and comprises a 6-nA-resolution current-output digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a SC thin-film as a gain element, and a voltage comparator. The circuit dissipates 1.5uW and is demonstrated operating at ambient temperatures as low as 15mK, providing a variable temperature resolution reaching sub-10mK.</description>

      <title>Symmetry generators and quantum numbers for fermionic circularly symmetric motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar dynamics of spin-1/2 quantum relativistic particles is important for several physical systems. In this paper we derive, by a simple method, the generators for the continuous symmetries of the 3+1 Dirac equation for planar motion, when there is circular symmetry, i.e., the interactions depend only on the radial coordinate. We consider a general set of potentials with different Lorentz structures. These generators allow for several minimal complete sets of commuting observables and their corresponding quantum numbers. We show how they can be used to label the general eigenspinors for this problem. We also derive the generators of the spin and pseudospin symmetries for this planar Dirac problem, which arise when the vector and scalar potentials have the same magnitude and tensor potential and the space components of the four-vector potential are absent. We investigate the associated energy degeneracies and compare them to the known degeneracies in the spherically symmetric 3+1 Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics Coupled-Cluster Theory: Exploring Photon-Induced Electron Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our successful implementation of the quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster method with single and double excitations (QED-CCSD) for electronic and bosonic amplitudes, covering both individual and mixed excitation processes within the ExaChem program package, which relies on the Tensor Algebra for Many-body Methods (TAMM) infrastructure. TAMM is a parallel heterogeneous tensor library designed for utilizing modern computing platforms, from laptops to leadership-class computing resources. This developed computational framework extends the traditional CCSD method to incorporate the intricate interplay between electronic and bosonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of quantum phenomena. We discuss theoretical foundations, algorithmic details, and numerical benchmarks to demonstrate how the integration of bosonic degrees of freedom alters the electronic ground state. The interactions between electrons and photons within an optical cavity are modeled using the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian within the dipole approximation in the length gauge. The integration of QED effects within the CCSD framework contributes to a more accurate and versatile model for simulating complex quantum systems, thereby opening avenues for a better understanding, prediction, and manipulation of various physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Concentration of quantum channels with random Kraus operators via matrix Bernstein inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we generate quantum channels with random Kraus operators to typically obtain almost twirling quantum channels and quantum expanders. To prove the concentration phenomena, we use matrix Bernstein's inequality. In this way, our random models do not utilize Haar-distributed unitary matrices or Gaussian matrices. Rather, as in the preceding research, we use unitary $t$-designs to generate mixed tenor-product unitary channels acting on $\mathbb C^{d^t}$. Although our bounds in Schatten $p$-norm are valid only for $1\leq p \leq 2$, we show that they are typically almost twirling quantum channels with the tail bound proportional to $1/\mathrm{poly}(d^t)$, while such bounds were previously constants. The number of required Kraus operators was also improved by powers of $\log d$ and $t$. Such random quantum channels are also typically quantum expanders, but the number of Kraus operators must grow proportionally to $\log d$ in our case. Finally, a new non-unital model of super-operators generated by bounded and isotropic random Kraus operators was introduced, which can be typically rectified to give almost randomizing quantum channels and quantum expanders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's states are among the most useful in quantum computing. These state are an orthonormal base of entagled states with two qubits. We propose alternative bases of entangled states. Some of these states depend on a continuous parameter. We present the quantum circuit and code of these alternative bases. In addition, we study quantum teleportation with these entangled states and present their quantum circuits and codes associated.</description>

      <title>Disorder enhanced exciton transport and quantum information spreading with the assistance of cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular materials have been studied as a potential platform for highly efficient transport such as exciton transport and quantum information spreading. However, one detrimental factor to transport efficiency is the inherent disorder of the molecular system, where site-to-site hopping is suppressed by Anderson localization. Here we theoretically report a novel approach to eliminate the negative impact of disorder by strongly coupling the system to a cavity, where the cavity photon bridges spatially separated sites and builds an additional transport channel, cavity-mediated jumping. Our analysis of the open quantum system dynamics shows in terms of long-range transport, the two channels hold a competitive relation. When disorder suppresses site-to-site hopping, transport occurs mainly through cavity-mediated jumping in disguise. Therefore, with the assistance of the cavity, disorder in certain ranges can enhance transport and certain disordered systems can even be more efficient for transport than the homogeneous system. These results provide insight into the design of next-generation materials for exciton transport and quantum information spreading by leveraging hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubit Generation via Approximate Squeezed Schr\"odinger Cat State Breeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement based methods can produce high quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed Schr\"odinger cat states created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than other measurement based methods, while still producing states with high-fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Cross-Model Framework for Benchmarking the Performance of Quantum Hamiltonian Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing and forms the basis for many quantum algorithms. Benchmarking them is an important gauge of progress in quantum computing technology. We present a methodology and software framework to evaluate various facets of the performance of gate-based quantum computers on Trotterized quantum Hamiltonian evolution. We propose three distinct modes for benchmarking: (i) comparing simulation on a real device to that on a noiseless classical simulator, (ii) comparing simulation on a real device with exact diagonalization results, and (iii) using scalable mirror circuit techniques to assess hardware performance in scenarios beyond classical simulation methods. We demonstrate this framework on five Hamiltonian models from the HamLib library: the Fermi and Bose-Hubbard models, the transverse field Ising model, the Heisenberg model, and the Max3SAT problem. Experiments were conducted using Qiskit's Aer simulator, BlueQubit's CPU cluster and GPU simulators, and IBM's quantum hardware. Our framework, extendable to other Hamiltonians, provides comprehensive performance profiles that reveal hardware and algorithmic limitations and measure both fidelity and execution times, identifying crossover points where quantum hardware outperforms CPU/GPU simulators.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-optimized quantum surface code via GAN decoder and application to quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a strong deep learning model that has shown its value in practical applications such as image processing and data enhancement. Here, we propose a quantum topological code decoder based on GAN and we apply it to optimize the fault-tolerant quantum teleportation system. We construct the generator and discriminator networks of GAN, train the network using the eigenvalue dataset of the topological code, and obtain an optimized decoder with high decoding threshold. The decoding experiments at code distances $d=3$ and $d=5$ show that the error correction success rate of this model reaches 99.895\%. In the experiment, the fidelity threshold of this GAN decoder is about $P=0.2108$, which is significantly improved compared with the threshold $P=0.1099$ of the classical decoding model. In addition, the quantum teleportation system, optimized for noise resistance under $d=3$ topological code, shows a noticeable fidelity improvement within the non-polarized noise threshold range of $P&lt;0.06503$, while under $d=5$ topological code optimization, there is a significant fidelity improvement within the non-polarized noise threshold range of $P&lt;0.07512$. The proposed GAN model supplies a novel approach for topological code decoders and its principles can be applied to different kinds of noise processing.</description>

      <title>Realization of Constant-Depth Fan-Out with Real-Time Feedforward on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using unitary gate sequences, the growth in depth of many quantum circuits with output size poses significant obstacles to practical quantum computation. The quantum fan-out operation, which reduces the circuit depth of quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform and Shor's algorithm, is an example that can be realized in constant depth independent of the output size. Here, we demonstrate a quantum fan-out gate with real-time feedforward on up to four output qubits using a superconducting quantum processor. By performing quantum state tomography on the output states, we benchmark our gate with input states spanning the entire Bloch sphere. We decompose the output-state error into a set of independently characterized error contributions. We extrapolate our constant-depth circuit to offer a scaling advantage compared to the unitary fan-out sequence beyond 25 output qubits with feedforward control, or beyond 17 output qubits if the classical feedforward latency is negligible. Our work highlights the potential of mid-circuit measurements combined with real-time conditional operations to improve the efficiency of complex quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Train with Tensor Network Mapping Model and Distributed Circuit Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Quantum-Train (QT) framework, mapping quantum state measurements to classical neural network weights is a critical challenge that affects the scalability and efficiency of hybrid quantum-classical models. The traditional QT framework employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for this task, but it struggles with scalability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose replacing the MLP with a tensor network-based model and introducing a distributed circuit ansatz designed for large-scale quantum machine learning with multiple small quantum processing unit nodes. This approach enhances scalability, efficiently represents high-dimensional data, and maintains a compact model structure. Our enhanced QT framework retains the benefits of reduced parameter count and independence from quantum resources during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the tensor network-based QT framework achieves competitive performance with improved efficiency and generalization, offering a practical solution for scalable hybrid quantum-classical machine learning.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement the first open-source quantum computing emulator that includes arithmetic operations, the quantum Fourier transform, and quantum phase estimation. The emulator provides significant savings in both temporal and spatial resources compared to simulation, and these computational advantages are verified through comparison to the Intel Quantum Simulator. We also demonstrate how to use the emulator to implement Shor's algorithm and use it to solve a nontrivial factoring problem. This demonstrates that emulation can make quantum computing more accessible than simulation or noisy hardware by allowing researchers to study the behavior of algorithms on large problems in a noiseless environment.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</description>

      <title>Fully-Optimized Quantum Metrology: Framework, Tools, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial introduces a systematic approach for addressing the key question of quantum metrology: For a generic task of sensing an unknown parameter, what is the ultimate precision given a constrained set of admissible strategies. The approach outputs the maximal attainable precision (in terms of the maximum of quantum Fisher information) as a semidefinite program and optimal strategies as feasible solutions thereof. Remarkably, the approach can identify the optimal precision for different sets of strategies, including parallel, sequential, quantum SWITCH-enhanced, causally superposed, and generic indefinite-causal-order strategies. The tutorial consists of a pedagogic introduction to the background and mathematical tools of optimal quantum metrology, a detailed derivation of the main approach, and various concrete examples. As shown in the tutorial, applications of the approach include, but are not limited to, strict hierarchy of strategies in noisy quantum metrology, memory effect in non-Markovian metrology, and designing optimal strategies. Compared with traditional approaches, the approach here yields the exact value of the optimal precision, offering more accurate criteria for experiments and practical applications. It also allows for the comparison between conventional strategies and the recently discovered causally-indefinite strategies, serving as a powerful tool for exploring this new area of quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body simulation of finite-temperature systems with sampling a series expansion of a quantum imaginary-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating thermal-equilibrium properties at finite temperature plays a crucial role in studying the nature of quantum many-body systems. In particular, implementing a finite-temperature simulation on a quantum computer is expected to overcome the difficulty in simulating large-sized systems, for which the quantum Monte-Carlo technique on a classical computer suffers from the sign problem in general. While several methods suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) devices are expected to be useful in studying large-scale quantum many-body systems, those proposed so far involve a large number of ancilla qubits and a deep quantum circuit with many basic gates, making them unsuitable for the early-FTQC era, i.e., the early stage of the FTQC era, at which only a limited number of qubits and quantum gates are available. In this paper, we propose a method suitable for quantum devices in this early stage to calculate the thermal-equilibrium expectation value of an observable at finite temperature. Our proposal, named the Markov-chain Monte Carlo with sampled-pairs of unitaries (MCMC-SPU) algorithm, is based on sampling simple quantum circuits and generating the corresponding statistical ensembles, and overcomes the difficulties in the resource requirements and the decay in probability associated with postselection of measurement outcomes on ancilla qubits. We demonstrate the validity of our proposal by performing a numerical simulation of the MCMC-SPU algorithm on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as an illustrative example.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo methods for Newsvendor problem with Multiple Unreliable Suppliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the post-pandemic world, manufacturing enterprises face increasing uncertainties, especially with vulnerabilities in global supply chains. Although supply chain management has been extensively studied, the critical influence of decision-makers (DMs) in these systems remains underexplored. This study studies the inventory management problem under risk using the newsvendor model by incorporating DMs risk preferences. By employing the Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) combined with Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithm, the estimation of probabilities or expectation values can be done more efficiently. This offers near-quadratic speedup compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Our findings illuminate the intricate relationship between risk-aware decision-making and inventory management, providing essential insights for enhancing supply chain resilience and adaptability in uncertain conditions</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiates a systematic study of operators arising as integrals of operator-valued functions with respect to positive operator-valued measures and utilizes these tools to provide relativization maps (Yen) for quantum reference frames (QRFs) defined on general homogeneous spaces. Properties of operator-valued integration are first studied and then employed to define general relativization maps and show their properties. The relativization maps presented here are defined for QRFs (systems of covariance) based on arbitrary homogeneous spaces of locally compact second countable topological groups and are shown to be contracting quantum channels, injective for localizable (norm-1 property) frames and multiplicative for the sharp ones (PVMs), extending the existing results.</description>

      <title>Rescaling transformations and the Grothendieck bound formalism in a single quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grothedieck bound formalism is studied using `rescaling transformations', in the context of a single quantum system. The rescaling transformations enlarge the set of unitary transformations (which apply to isolated systems), with transformations that change not only the phase but also the absolute value of the wavefunction, and can be linked to irreversible phenomena (e.g., quantum tunnelling, damping and amplification, etc). A special case of rescaling transformations are the dequantisation transformations, which map a Hilbert space formalism into a formalism of scalars. The Grothendieck formalism considers a `classical' quadratic form ${\cal C}(\theta)$ which takes values less than $1$, and the corresponding `quantum' quadratic form ${\cal Q}(\theta)$ which takes values greater than $1$, up to the complex Grothendieck constant $k_G$. It is shown that ${\cal Q}(\theta)$ can be expressed as the trace of the product of $\theta$ with two rescaling matrices, and ${\cal C}(\theta)$ can be expressed as the trace of the product of $\theta$ with two dequantisation matrices. Values of ${\cal Q}(\theta)$ in the `ultra-quantum' region $(1,k_G)$ are very important, because this region is classically forbidden (${\cal C}(\theta)$ cannot take values in it). An example with ${\cal Q}(\theta)\in (1,k_G)$ is given, which is related to phenomena where classically isolated by high potentials regions of space, communicate through quantum tunnelling. Other examples show that `ultra-quantumness' according to the Grothendieck formalism (${\cal Q}(\theta)\in (1,k_G)$), is different from quantumness according to other criteria (like quantum interference or the uncertainty principle).</description>

      <title>Variational LOCC-assisted quantum circuits for long-range entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range entanglement is an important quantum resource, especially for topological orders and quantum error correction. In reality, preparing long-range entangled states requires a deep unitary circuit, which poses significant experimental challenges. A promising avenue is offered by replacing some quantum resources with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). With these classical components, one can communicate information from mid-circuit measurements in distant parts of the system, which results in a substantial reduction of circuit depth in many important cases. However, to prepare general long-range entangled states, finding LOCC-assisted circuits of a short depth remains an open question. Here, we address such a challenge by proposing a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to find ground states of given Hamiltonians based on parameterized LOCC protocols. We introduce an efficient protocol for estimating parameter gradients and use such gradients for variational optimization. Theoretically, we establish the conditions for the absence of barren plateaus, ensuring trainability at a large system size. Numerically, the algorithm accurately solves the ground state of long-range entangled models, such as the perturbed GHZ state and surface code. Our results clearly demonstrate the practical advantage of our algorithm in the accuracy of estimated ground state energy over conventional unitary variational circuits, as well as the theoretical advantage in creating long-range entanglement.</description>

      <title>Graphical Calculus for Non-Gaussian Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a graphical method to describe and analyze non-Gaussian quantum states using a hypergraph framework. These states are pivotal resources for quantum computing, communication, and metrology, but their characterization is hindered by their complex high-order correlations. The formalism encapsulates transformation rules for any Gaussian unitary operation and local quadrature measurement, offering a visually intuitive tool for manipulating such states through experimentally feasible pathways. Notably, we develop methods for the generation of complex hypergraph states with more or higher-order hyperedges from simple structures through Gaussian operations only, facilitated by our graphical rules. We present illustrative examples on the preparation of non-Gaussian states rooted in these graph-based formalisms, revealing their potential to advance continuous-variable general quantum computing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation via piecewise QSVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient state preparation is essential for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. Whilst several techniques for low-cost state preparation exist, this work facilitates further classes of states, whose amplitudes are well approximated by piecewise polynomials. We show how such states can be efficiently prepared using a piecewise Quantum Singular Value Transformation along with a new piecewise linear diagonal block encoding. We illustrate this with the explicit examples of $\sqrt{x}|x\rangle$ and $\log x|x\rangle$. Further, our technique reduces the cost of window boosted Quantum Phase Estimation by efficiently preparing the B-spline window state. We demonstrate this window state requires 100 times fewer T-gates to prepare than the state-of-the-art Kaiser window state, and we show that the B-spline window replicates the Kaiser window's exponential reduction in tail probability for QPE.</description>

      <title>Efficient state preparation for multivariate Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a task to prepare a state with a specific function encoded in the amplitude, which is an essential subroutine in many quantum algorithms. In this paper, we focus on multivariate state preparation, as it is an important extension for many application areas. Specifically in finance, multivariate state preparation is required for multivariate Monte Carlo simulation, which is used for important numerical tasks such as risk aggregation and multi-asset derivative pricing. Using existing methods, multivariate quantum state preparation requires the number of gates exponential in the number of variables $D$. For this task, we propose a quantum algorithm that only requires the number of gates linear in $D$. Our algorithm utilizes multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP), a technique to perform the multivariate polynomial transformation of matrix elements. Using easily prepared block-encodings corresponding to each variable, we apply the M-QSP to construct the target function. In this way, our algorithm prepares the target state efficiently for functions achievable with M-QSP.</description>

      <title>Thermalization Dynamics of Entanglement and non-Locality of Filtered Two-Mode Squeezed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how entanglement and non-locality evolve between specific spectral components of two-mode squeezed states in thermal environments. These spectral components are extracted from output modes using filters that are frequently utilized in optomechanical systems. We consider two distinct thermalization scenarios: one occurring in the vacuum state prior to entering the nonlinear crystal for squeezing, and another after the generation of the two-mode squeezed vacuum but before passing through filters and detectors. Entanglement and non-locality generally remain at their peak when identical filters are applied throughout. In the first scenario, higher initial squeezing levels cause the dissipation of entanglement to begin slower, then accelerate over time, while the dissipation rate of non-locality moreover stays consistent. In the second scenario, greater squeezing results in a more rapid loss of both entanglement and non-locality. We identify the evolution of specific boundaries for entanglement and non-locality and the conditions for their optimization. Finally, for all the cases, increasing the thermal population of the environment enhances the rate of dissipation, whereas stronger interaction slows dissipation in a normalized dimensionless time scale</description>

      <title>Uncovering Quantum Many-body Scars with Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are rare eigenstates hidden within the chaotic spectra of many-body systems, representing a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Identifying these scars, as well as other non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, remains a significant challenge. Besides exact scar states, the nature of other non-thermal states lacking simple analytical characterization remains an open question. In this study, we employ tools from quantum machine learning -- specifically, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to explore hidden non-thermal states in chaotic many-body systems. Our simulations demonstrate that QCNNs achieve over 99% single-shot measurement accuracy in identifying all known scars. Furthermore, we successfully identify new non-thermal states in models such as the xorX model, the PXP model, and the far-coupling Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. In the xorX model, some of these non-thermal states can be approximately described as spin-wave modes of specific quasiparticles. We further develop effective tight-binding Hamiltonians within the quasiparticle subspace to capture key features of these many-body eigenstates. Finally, we validate the performance of QCNNs on IBM quantum devices, achieving single-shot measurement accuracy exceeding 63% under real-world noise and errors, with the aid of error mitigation techniques. Our results underscore the potential of QCNNs to uncover hidden non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Laser Activation of Single Group-IV Colour Centres in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-photon interfaces based on group-IV colour centres in diamond offer a promising platform for quantum networks. A key challenge in the field is realizing precise single-defect positioning and activation, which is crucial for scalable device fabrication. Here we address this problem by demonstrating a two-step fabrication method for tin vacancy (SnV-) centres that uses site-controlled ion implantation followed by local femtosecond laser annealing with in-situ spectral monitoring. The ion implantation is performed with sub-50 nm resolution and a dosage that is controlled from hundreds of ions down to single ions per site, limited by Poissonian statistics. Using this approach, we successfully demonstrate site-selective creation and modification of single SnV- centres. The technique opens a window onto materials tuning at the single defect level, and provides new insight into defect structures and dynamics during the annealing process. While demonstrated for SnV- centres, this versatile approach can be readily generalised to other implanted colour centres in diamond and wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectories and output field properties for two-photon input field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a stochastic evolution of a quantum system interacting with a light prepared in a continuous-mode two-photon state. The problem of a conditional evolution of the quantum system, depending on the results of the measurement of the output field, is formulated and solved making use of the model of repeated interactions. We define the discrete in-time interaction between the quantum system and its environment being the electromagnetic field approximated by a chain of harmonic oscillators. We determine analytical formulae for quantum trajectories associated with one-dimensional and two-dimensional counting processes, corresponding respectively to unidirectional or bidirectional input field prepared in the two-photon state. Moreover, we determine the formulae for the exclusive probability densities of photon counts that allow us to completely characterize the photon statistics of the output field. Finally, we show how to apply the quantum trajectories to obtain the formula for the probability of the two-photon absorption for a three-level atom in a ladder configuration. The paper also includes a discussion on the optimal two-photon state that maximizes the two-photon absorption probability.</description>

      <title>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21006v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping non-Hermitian Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the ``Bootstrap" technique was applied in Quantum Mechanics to solve the eigenspectra of Hermitian Hamiltonians and extended to non-Hermitian PT-symmetric systems. However, its application has been limited to real spectra. In this work, we establish bootstrap conditions for the non-Hermitian system and generate eigenspectra for a generic complex polynomial potential, which includes PT-symmetric Hamiltonians as a special case. Additionally, we demonstrate the method's ability to obtain eigenspectra under various boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunction, including the notable application of capturing the PT-symmetric phase transition.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Embedding for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated detector in a superposed spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of a full-fledged theory of quantum gravity, operational approaches offer insights into quantum-gravitational effects produced by quantum superposition of different spacetimes not diffeomorphic to one another. Recent work applies this approach to superpose cylindrically identified Minkowski spacetimes (i.e. periodic boundary conditions) with different characteristic circumferences, where a two-level detector coupled to a quantum field residing in the spacetime exhibits resonance peaks in response at certain values of the superposed length ratios. Here, we extend this analysis to a superposition of cylindrically identified Rindler spacetimes, considering a two-level detector constantly accelerated in the direction orthogonal to the compact dimension. Similarly to previous work, we find resonance peaks in the detector response at rational ratios of the superposed compactified lengths, which we observe to be accentuated by the acceleration of the detector. Furthermore, for the first time we confirm the detailed balance condition due to acceleration in a superposition of spacetimes, commensurate with the Unruh effect in a single spacetime state. The resonant structure of detector response in the presence of event horizons, for the first time observed in 3+1 dimensions, may offer clues to the nature of black hole entropy in the full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance List Decoding Algorithm for Surface Codes with Erroneous Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Surface codes are a class of topological QECCs that have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional error-correcting capabilities and easy implementation. In the decoding process of surface codes, the syndromes are crucial for error correction, though they are not always correctly measured. Most of the existing decoding algorithms for surface codes are not equipped to handle erroneous syndrome information or need additional measurements to correct syndromes with errors, which implies a potential increase in inference complexity and decoding latency. In this paper, we propose a high-performance list decoding algorithm for surface codes with erroneous syndromes. More specifically, to cope with erroneous syndrome information, we incorporate syndrome soft information, allowing the syndrome to be listed as well. To enhance the efficiency of the list decoding algorithm, we use LCOSD, which can significantly reduce the average list size in classical error correction compared with the conventional ordered statistics decoding (OSD). Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the decoding performance of surface codes with erroneous syndromes compared to minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) and BP decoders.</description>

Abstract: We consider mid-spectrum eigenstates of the Sachdev-Ye-Kiteav (SYK) model. We prove that for subsystems whose size is a constant fraction of the system size, the entanglement entropy deviates from the maximum entropy by at least a positive constant. This result highlights the difference between the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of the SYK model and that of random states.</description>

      <title>Population Dynamics of Schr\"odinger Cats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an exact equivalence between classical population dynamics and Lindbladian evolution admitting a dark state and obeying a set of certain local symmetries. We then introduce {\em quantum population dynamics} as models in which this local symmetry condition is relaxed. This allows for non-classical processes in which animals behave like Schr\"odinger's cat and enter superpositions of live and dead states, thus resulting in coherent superpositions of different population numbers. We develop a field theory treatment of quantum population models as a synthesis of Keldysh and third quantization techniques and draw comparisons to the stochastic Doi-Peliti field theory description of classical population models. We apply this formalism to study a prototypical ``Schr\"odigner cat'' population model on a $d$-dimensional lattice, which exhibits a phase transition between a dark extinct phase and an active phase that supports a stable quantum population. Using a perturbative renormalization group approach, we find a critical scaling of the Schr\"odinger cat population distinct from that observed in both classical population dynamics and usual quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a $SO(3)$ non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D with quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this work, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans\"{a}tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of superconducting qubit components from titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) layers to create Josephson junctions and superconducting resonators in an all-nitride architecture. Our methodology comprises a complete process flow for the fabrication of TiN/AlN/TiN junctions, characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ellipsometry and DC electrical measurements. We evaluated the sputtering rates of AlN under varied conditions, the critical temperatures of TiN thin films for different sputtering environments, and the internal quality factors of TiN resonators in the few-GHz regime, fabricated from these films. Overall, this offered insights into the material properties critical to qubit performance. Measurements of the dependence of the critical current of the TiN / AlN / TiN junctions yielded values ranging from 150 ${\mu}$A to 2 ${\mu}$A, for AlN barrier thicknesses up to ca. 5 nm, respectively. Our findings demonstrate advances in the fabrication of nitride-based superconducting qubit components, which may find applications in quantum computing technologies based on novel materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Dynamics as a Probe for Non-Hermitian Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Systems with Periodic Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Electron Transport in [110] and [100] Silicon Nanowires: A DFT - Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of very low temperature on the electron transport in a [110] and [100] axially aligned unstrained silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are investigated. A combination of semi-empirical 10-orbital tight-binding method, density functional theory (DFT), and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods are used. Both acoustic and optical phonons are included in the electron-phonon scattering rate calculations covering both intra-subband and inter-subband events. A comparison with room temperature (300 K) characteristics shows that for both nanowires, the average electron steady-state drift velocity increases at least 2 times at relatively moderate electric fields and lower temperatures. Furthermore, the average drift velocity in [110] nanowires is 50 percent more than that of [100] nanowires, explained by the difference in their conduction subband effective mass. Transient average electron velocity suggests that there is a pronounced streaming electron motion at low temperature which is attributed to the reduced electron-phonon scattering rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is observed that the Cauchy integral formula (CIF) can be used to represent holomorphic functions of diagonalizable operators on a finite domain. This forms the theoretical foundation for applying various operators in the form of a contour integral to a state, while filtering away eigen-components that are not included by the contour. As a special case, the identity operator in the integral form--the Riesz projector--is used to design a black-box algorithm for finding a given number of eigen-pairs whose energies are close to a specified value in the equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) framework, with applications to calculate core excited states of molecules which is relevant for the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a generalization, I showcase a novel real-time electron dynamics (RT-EOM-CCSD) algorithm based on the CIF form of the exponential time-evolution operator, which admits extremely large time steps while preserving accurate spectral information.</description>

Abstract: Quantum billiards are a key focus in quantum mechanics, offering a simple yet powerful model to study complex quantum features. While the development of algebras for quantum systems is traced from one-dimensional integrable models to quantum groups and the Generalized Heisenberg Algebra (GHA). The primary focus of this work is to extend the GHA to quantum billiards, showcasing its application to separable and non-separable billiards. We apply the formalism to a square billiard, first generating one-dimensional coherent states with specific quantum numbers and exploring their time evolution.Then, we extend this approach to develop two-dimensional coherent states for the square billiards. We also demonstrate its applicability in a non-separable equilateral triangle billiard, describing their algebra generators and associated one-dimensional coherent states.</description>

Abstract: Since the early days of quantum mechanics hydrogen, as the simplest of all atoms, has been studied or used to investigate new physics. In parallel, this knowledge leads to different applications, e.g. a spin filter to separate metastable hydrogen atoms in single hyperfine substates with electron spin m_s=1/2. Subsequently, this work provides the necessary theory as well as experimental conditions to build a new generation of spin filter which permits the separation of all four individual metastable hydrogen hyperfine states as well as for its isotopes in a corresponding beam.</description>

      <title>High-contrast ZZ interaction using superconducting qubits with opposite-sign anharmonicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.07560v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For building a scalable quantum processor with superconducting qubits, ZZ interaction is of great concern because its residual has a crucial impact to two-qubit gate fidelity. Two-qubit gates with fidelity meeting the criterion of fault-tolerant quantum computationhave been demonstrated using ZZ interaction. However, as the performance of quantum processors improves, the residual static-ZZ can become a performance-limiting factor for quantum gate operation and quantum error correction. Here, we introduce a superconducting architecture using qubits with opposite-sign anharmonicity, a transmon qubit and a C-shunt flux qubit, to address this issue. We theoretically demonstrate that by coupling the two types of qubits, the high-contrast ZZ interaction can be realized. Thus, we can control the interaction with a high on/off ratio to implement two-qubit CZ gates, or suppress it during two-qubit gate operation using XY interaction (e.g., an iSWAP gate). The proposed architecture can also be scaled up to multi-qubit cases. In a fixed coupled system, ZZ crosstalk related to neighboring spectator qubits could also be heavily suppressed.</description>

      <title>Suppression of static ZZ interaction in an all-transmon quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.03976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting transmon qubit is currently a leading qubit modality for quantum computing, but gate performance in quantum processor with transmons is often insufficient to support running complex algorithms for practical applications. It is thus highly desirable to further improve gate performance. Due to the weak anharmonicity of transmon, a static ZZ interaction between coupled transmons commonly exists, undermining the gate performance, and in long term, it can become performance limiting. Here we theoretically explore a previously unexplored parameter region in an all-transmon system to address this issue. We show that an feasible parameter region, where the ZZ interaction is heavily suppressed while leaving XY interaction with an adequate strength to implement two-qubit gates, can be found for all-transmon systems. Thus, two-qubit gates, such as cross-resonance gate or iSWAP gate, can be realized without the detrimental effect from static ZZ interaction. To illustrate this, we demonstrate that an iSWAP gate with fast gate speed and dramatically lower conditional phase error can be achieved. Scaling up to large-scale transmon quantum processor, especially the cases with fixed coupling, addressing error, idling error, and crosstalk that arises from static ZZ interaction could also be strongly suppressed.</description>

      <title>Dicke superradiance in ordered lattices: dimensionality matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08380v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance in ordered atomic arrays is a phenomenon where atomic synchronization gives rise to a burst in photon emission. This superradiant burst only occurs if there is one -- or just a few -- dominant decay channels. For a fixed atom number, this happens only below a critical interatomic distance. Here we show that array dimensionality is the determinant factor that drives superradiance. In 2D and 3D arrays, superradiance occurs due to constructive interference, which grows stronger with atom number. This leads to a critical distance that scales sublogarithmically with atom number in 2D, and as a power law in 3D. In 1D arrays, superradiance occurs due to destructive interference that effectively switches off certain decay channels, yielding a critical distance that saturates with atom number. Our results provide a guide to explore many-body decay in state-of-the art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Quantum diffeomorphisms cannot make indefinite causal order definite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of indefinite causal order has seen significant advancements in recent years. While classically the causal order of two timelike separated events A and B is fixed - either A before B or B before A - this is no longer true in quantum theory. There, it is possible to encounter superpositions of causal orders. The quantum switch is one of the most prominent processes with indefinite causal order. While the optical quantum switch has been successfully implemented in experiments, some argue that this merely simulates a process with indefinite causal order and that a superposition of spacetime metrics is required for a true realization. Here, we provide a relativistic definition of causal order, show that it encompasses both the optical and gravitational quantum switch, and does not differentiate between them. Moreover, we show that this notion of causal order is invariant under so-called quantum diffeomorphisms and that it is an operationally meaningful observable in both the general relativistic and quantum mechanical sense. Importantly, this observable does not distinguish between the indefinite causal order implemented in the optical and gravitational quantum switch, thus supporting the thesis that the optical quantum switch is just as much a realization of indefinite causal order as its gravitational counterpart.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Estimation by Compressed Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07008v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a signal recovery algorithm, compressed sensing is particularly useful when the data has low-complexity and samples are rare, which matches perfectly with the task of quantum phase estimation (QPE). In this work we present a new Heisenberg-limited QPE algorithm for early quantum computers based on compressed sensing. More specifically, given many copies of a proper initial state and queries to some unitary operators, our algorithm is able to recover the frequency with a total runtime $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\text{poly}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\epsilon$ is the accuracy. Moreover, the maximal runtime satisfies $T_{\max}\epsilon \ll \pi$, which is comparable to the state of art algorithms, and our algorithm is also robust against certain amount of noise from sampling. We also consider the more general quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (QEEP) and show numerically that the off-grid compressed sensing can be a strong candidate for solving the QEEP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exciton transfer along a polymer is essential for many biological processes, for instance light harvesting in photosynthetic biosystems. Here we apply a new witness of non-classicality to this phenomenon, to conclude that, if an exciton can mediate the coherent quantum evolution of a photon, then the exciton is non-classical. We then propose a general qubit model for the quantum transfer of an exciton along a polymer chain, also discussing the effects of environmental decoherence. The generality of our results makes them ideal candidates to design new tests of quantum features in complex bio-molecules.</description>

      <title>A review and analysis of six extended Wigner's friend arguments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wigner's friend thought experiment was intended to illustrate the difficulty one has in describing an agent as a quantum system when that agent performs a measurement. While it does pose a challenge to the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory, most modern interpretations have no trouble in resolving the difficulty. Recently, a number of extensions of Wigner's ideas have been proposed. We provide a gentle introduction to six such arguments, modifying the specifics of many of them so that they are as simple and unified as possible. In particular, we show that all of the arguments hinge on assumptions about correlations between measurement outcomes that are not accessible to any observer, even in principle. We then provide a critical analysis of each argument, focusing especially on how well one can motivate the required assumptions regarding these inaccessible correlations. Although we argue that some of these assumptions are not entirely well-motivated, all of the arguments do shed light on the nature of quantum theory, especially when concerning the description of agents and their measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient entanglement purification based on noise guessing decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel bipartite entanglement purification protocol built upon hashing and upon the guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) approach recently devised for classical error correction codes. Our protocol offers substantial advantages over existing hashing protocols, requiring fewer qubits for purification, achieving higher fidelities, and delivering better yields with reduced computational costs. We provide numerical and semi-analytical results to corroborate our findings and provide a detailed comparison with the hashing protocol of Bennet et al. Although that pioneering work devised performance bounds, it did not offer an explicit construction for implementation. The present work fills that gap, offering both an explicit and more efficient purification method. We demonstrate that our protocol is capable of purifying states with noise on the order of 10% per Bell pair even with a small ensemble of 16 pairs. The work explores a measurement-based implementation of the protocol to address practical setups with noise. This work opens the path to practical and efficient entanglement purification using hashing-based methods with feasible computational costs. Compared to the original hashing protocol, the proposed method can achieve some desired fidelity with a number of initial resources up to one hundred times smaller. Therefore, the proposed method seems well-fit for future quantum networks with a limited number of resources and entails a relatively low computational overhead.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard gate cannot be replaced by a resource state in universal quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider models of quantum computation that involve operations performed on some fixed resourceful quantum state. Examples that fit this paradigm include magic state injection and measurement-based approaches. We introduce a framework that incorporates both of these cases and focus on the role of coherence (or superposition) in this context, as exemplified through the Hadamard gate. We prove that given access to incoherent unitaries (those that are unable to generate superposition from computational basis states, e.g. CNOT, diagonal gates), classical control, computational basis measurements, and any resourceful ancillary state (of arbitrary dimension), it is not possible to implement any coherent unitary (e.g. Hadamard) exactly with non-zero probability. We also consider the approximate case by providing lower bounds for the induced trace distance between the above operations and $n$ Hadamard gates. To demonstrate the stability of this result, this is then extended to a similar no-go result for the case of using $k$ Hadamard gates to exactly implement $n&gt;k$ Hadamard gates.</description>

      <title>Labeling eigenstates of qubit-cavity systems based on the continuity of qubit occupancy: Detecting resonances to higher excited qubit states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for labeling the eigenstates of qubit-cavity systems based on the continuity of the qubit occupancy. The labeled eigenstates give a rough estimation of the evolution of a quantum state under cavity driving. The photon-number dependence of the resonant cavity frequency can be estimated from the labeled eigenenergies, and resonances to higher excited qubit states are visible in the dependence. Our proposed method can be applied to a broader parameter region compared to an existing method. With the proposed method, we investigate the offset charge dependence of the resonances to higher excited states that can induce leakage effects from the computational basis. The results imply that the leakage can occur with only around ten photons.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of cost concentration and gradient vanishing for quantum circuits: An elementary proof in the Riemannian formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimization of quantum circuits can be hampered by a decay of average gradient amplitudes with increasing system size. When the decay is exponential, this is called the barren plateau problem. Considering explicit circuit parametrizations (in terms of rotation angles), it has been shown in Arrasmith et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 7, 045015 (2022) that barren plateaus are equivalent to an exponential decay of the variance of cost-function differences. We show that the issue is particularly simple in the (parametrization-free) Riemannian formulation of such optimization problems and obtain a tighter bound for the cost-function variance. An elementary derivation shows that the single-gate variance of the cost function is strictly equal to half the variance of the Riemannian single-gate gradient, where we sample variable gates according to the uniform Haar measure. The total variances of the cost function and its gradient are then both bounded from above by the sum of single-gate variances and, conversely, bound single-gate variances from above. So, decays of gradients and cost-function variations go hand in hand, and barren plateau problems cannot be resolved by avoiding gradient-based in favor of gradient-free optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in a sequence of measurements of non-commuting observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use continuous, stochastic quantum trajectories within a framework of quantum state diffusion (QSD) to describe alternating measurements of two non-commuting observables. Projective measurement of an observable completely destroys memory of the outcome of a previous measurement of the conjugate observable. In contrast, measurement under QSD is not projective and it is possible to vary the rate at which information about previous measurement outcomes is lost by changing the strength of measurement. We apply our methods to a spin 1/2 system and a spin 1 system undergoing alternating measurements of the $S_{z}$ and $S_{x}$ spin observables. Performing strong $S_{z}$ measurements and weak $S_{x}$ measurements on the spin 1 system, we demonstrate return to the same eigenstate of $S_{z}$ to a degree beyond that expected from projective measurements and the Born rule. Such a memory effect appears to be greater for return to the $\pm1$ eigenstates than the $0$ eigenstate. Furthermore, the spin 1 system follows a measurement cascade process where an initial superposition of the three eigenstates of the observable evolves into a superposition of just two, before finally collapsing into a single eigenstate, giving rise to a distinctive pattern of evolution of the spin components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The projected ensemble is based on the study of the quantum state of a subsystem $A$ conditioned on projective measurements in its complement. Recent studies have observed that a more refined measure of the thermalization of a chaotic quantum system can be defined on the basis of convergence of the projected ensemble to a quantum state design, i.e. a system thermalizes when it becomes indistinguishable, up to the $k$-th moment, from a Haar ensemble of uniformly distributed pure states. Here we consider a random unitary circuit with the brick-wall geometry and analyze its convergence to the Haar ensemble through the frame potential and its mapping to a statistical mechanical problem. This approach allows us to highlight a geometric interpretation of the frame potential based on the existence of a fluctuating membrane, similar to those appearing in the study of entanglement entropies. At large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we find that all moments converge simultaneously with a time scaling linearly in the size of region $A$, a feature previously observed in dual unitary models. However, based on the geometric interpretation, we argue that the scaling at finite $q$ on the basis of rare membrane fluctuations, finding the logarithmic scaling of design times $t_k = O(\log k)$. Our results are supported with numerical simulations performed at $q=2$.</description>

Abstract: We utilize click-counting theory for the reconstruction of photon statistics. Our approach employs an analytic pseudo-inversion method to estimate photon counts from measured click counts. A reconfigurable time-bin multiplexing, click-counting detector is set up that renders it possible to alter the photon-number resolution as needed. A detector tomography is carried out, yielding vital measurement features, such as quantum efficiencies, cross-talk rates, etc. We gauge the success of the pseudo-inversion by applying the Mandel and binomial parameters, resulting in an additional interpretation of these parameters for the discrimination of distinct quantum statistics. In addition, we apply a loss deconvolution technique to account for detection losses.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal correlation represents the key feature of quantum mechanics, and is an exploitable resource in quantum information processing. However, the loophole issues and the associated applicability compromises hamper the practical applications. We report the first detection-loophole-free demonstration of steering nonlocality in a fully chip-fiber telecommunication system, with an ultra-fast measurement switching rate (2.5 GHz). In this endeavor, we propose the phase-encoding measurement scheme to adapt the system to the GHz-level modulation rate. We design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation, and devise an asymmetric paradigm to mimic the measurement implementation at the steering party thus avoiding the phase-encoding loss. Consequently, we build a fiber-optic setup that can overcome the detection efficiency that is required by conclusive quantum steering with actively switched multiple measurement settings. Our setup presents an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) states that the range and strength of interactions between the constituents of a complex many-body system impose upper limits to how fast the signal can propagate. It manifests in a light cone-like growth of correlation function connecting two distant subsystems. Here we employ the techniques of quantum information to demonstrate that the LRB can be determined from local measurements performed on a single qubit that is connected to a many-body system. This formulation provides an operational recipe for estimating the LRB in complex systems, replacing the measurement of the correlation function with simple single-particle manipulations. We demonstrate the potency of this approach by deriving the upper limit to the speed of signal propagation in the XY spin chain.</description>

Abstract: The use of deep learning in physical sciences has recently boosted the ability of researchers to tackle physical systems where little or no analytical insight is available. Recently, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been introduced as one of the most promising tools to solve systems of differential equations guided by some physically grounded constraints. In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator. We investigate systems with real and imaginary frequency, laying the foundation for novel numerical methods to tackle problems emerging in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, a global Lindbladian ansatz is constructed which leads to thermalization at temperature $T$ to the Gibs state of the investigated system. This ansatz connects every two eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and leads to a simple master equation known in the literature as the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The main message of this paper is that RTA, being a Lindbladian approach itself, can be used as Lindbladian securing thermalization when modeling physical processes, and can be consequently combined with other types of Lindbladians which would drive the system of the equilibrium state. I demonstrate it with two applications. The first application is the slow cooling (or heating) of quantum systems by varying the environment temperature to a critical point. With this RTA-Lindblad ansatz, one can directly relate to the equilibrium behavior of the system, and if an order parameter has the exponent $\Psi$, the remaining value at the phase transition will decrease with $1/\tau^{\Psi}$, where $\tau$ is the overall time of the slow process. In the second application, I investigate the change in the expectation value of a conserved quantity (an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian) due to an extra Lindbladian term which would drive the system out from equilibrium, while the thermalizing RTA-Lindbladian term is also present. I give a closed perturbative expression in the first order for the expectation value in the new steady state using only expectation values calculated in the original thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup of the Dispersion and Codebook Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new formulations of max-sum and max-min dispersion problems that enable solutions via the Grover adaptive search (GAS) quantum algorithm, offering quadratic speedup. Dispersion problems are combinatorial optimization problems classified as NP-hard, which appear often in coding theory and wireless communications applications involving optimal codebook design. In turn, GAS is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm that can be used to implement full-fledged maximum-likelihood optimal solutions. In conventional naive formulations however, it is typical to rely on a binary vector spaces, resulting in search space sizes prohibitive even for GAS. To circumvent this challenge, we instead formulate the search of optimal dispersion problem over Dicke states, an equal superposition of binary vectors with equal Hamming weights, which significantly reduces the search space leading to a simplification of the quantum circuit via the elimination of penalty terms. Additionally, we propose a method to replace distance coefficients with their ranks, contributing to the reduction of the number of qubits. Our analysis demonstrates that as a result of the proposed techniques a reduction in query complexity compared to the conventional GAS using Hadamard transform is achieved, enhancing the feasibility of the quantum-based solution of the dispersion problem.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe 99.1(1.8) % coherence retained under 20 ms exposure, yielding an imaging fidelity of 0.9992 and a survival probability of 0.988. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence, suggesting the potential future improvement of low cross-talk measurements. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Collective Emission of Giant emitters in the Zeno Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the collective Zeno dynamics of giant artificial atoms that are coupled, via multiple coupling points, to a common photonic or acoustic reservoir. In this regime, the establishment of atomic cooperativity and the revivification of exponential decay, are highly intertwined, which is utterly beyond the non-Markovian regime with only retarded backaction. We reveal that giant atoms build up their collective emission smoothly from the decay rate of zero to that predicted by Markovian approximation, and show great disparity between different waveguide QED setups. As a comparison, the step-like growth of instantaneous decay rates in the retardation-only picture has also been shown. All of these theoretical pictures predict the same collective behavior in the long time limit. From a phenomenological standpoint, we observe that the atomic superradiance exhabits significant directional property. In addition, the subradiant photons feature prolonged oscillation in the early stage of collective radiance, where the energy is exchanged remarkably between giant emitters and the field. Our results might be probed in state-of-art waveguide QED experiments, and fundamentally broaden the fields of collective emission in systems with giant atoms.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological transitions associated with a Weyl exceptional ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The environment-induced dissipation of an open system, once thought as a nuisance, can actually lead to emergence of many intriguing phenomena that are absent in an isolated system. Among these, Weyl exceptional rings (WER), extended from point-like singularities, are particularly interesting. Theoretically, a WER was predicted to carry a topological charge with a nonzero Chern number, but it has not been measured so far. We here investigate this topology in a circuit, where the WER is synthesized with a superconducting qubit controllably coupled to a decaying resonator. The high flexibility of the system enables us to characterize its eigenvectors on different manifolds of parameter space. We extract both the quantized Berry phase and Chern number from these eigenvectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate a topological transition triggered by shrinking the size of the manifold$-$a unique feature of the WER.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a qubit-readout architecture where the dispersive coupling is entirely mediated by a kinetic inductance. This allows us to engineer the dispersive shift of the readout resonator independent of the qubit and resonator capacitances. We validate the pure kinetic coupling concept and demonstrate various generalized flux qubit regimes from plasmon to fluxon, with dispersive shifts ranging from 60 kHz to 2 MHz at the half-flux quantum sweet spot. We achieve readout performances comparable to conventional architectures with quantum state preparation fidelities of 99.7 % and 92.7 % for the ground and excited states, respectively, and below 0.1 % leakage to non-computational states.</description>

      <title>Twisted electron impact elastic cross sections of polyatomic molecules: All active electron multicentered approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absolute elastic differential and Integral (total) cross-sections of polyatomic molecules by plane and twisted electron beam (Bessel Beam) impact are presented with $CO_2$ and $N_2O$ as examples. The cross sections are computed theoretically in the First Born Approximation(FBA). The target molecules are modeled using multicentered wavefunctions with Gaussian Type Orbitals(GTOs) and optimized through Density Functional Theory. The electron density obtained as a function of spatial coordinates is used to calculate the elastic form factor while considering the active role of all electrons in the molecule. Coulomb direct potentials are used for the interactions of the incident beam with all electrons and nuclei. An orientation averaging of the differential cross-section is performed to mimic experimental situations. The Young's interference effects due to the nuclei are considered. The cross sections are calculated at intermediate energies ranging from 300eV to 1keV. The proposed methodology can certainly be applied to any polyatomic molecule. The interactions of Bessel beams (Twisted Electron Beam) with topological charges $m_l$ = 1, 2, and 3 are analyzed. The average over impact parameters of the differential cross-sections representing the beam's interaction with a large number of molecules is also studied and presented. Finally, the Integral elastic cross-section (ICS) of the molecules by plane wave and twisted beams is calculated and presented.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on the Use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to Compute the Spectrum of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are of great interest for many research areas, including physics, biology and chemistry. However, their simulation is extremely challenging, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size, making it exceedingly difficult to parameterize the wave functions of large systems by using exact methods. Neural networks and machine learning in general are a way to face this challenge. For instance, methods like Tensor networks and Neural Quantum States are being investigated as promising tools to obtain the wave function of a quantum mechanical system. In this tutorial, we focus on a particularly promising class of deep learning algorithms. We explain how to construct a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) able to solve the Schr\"odinger equation for a given potential, by finding its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This technique is unsupervised, and utilizes a novel computational method in a manner that is barely explored. PINNs are a deep learning method that exploits Automatic Differentiation to solve Integro-Differential Equations in a mesh-free way. We show how to find both the ground and the excited states. The method discovers the states progressively by starting from the ground state. We explain how to introduce inductive biases in the loss to exploit further knowledge of the physical system. Such additional constraints allow for a faster and more accurate convergence. This technique can then be enhanced by a smart choice of collocation points in order to take advantage of the mesh-free nature of the PINN. The methods are made explicit by applying them to the infinite potential well and the particle in a ring, a challenging problem to be learned by an Artificial Intelligence agent due to the presence of complex-valued eigenfunctions and degenerate states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) quantum XYZ product can construct a class of non-CSS codes by using three classical codes. However, their error-correcting performance has not been studied in depth so far and whether this code construction can be generalized to higher dimension is an open question. In this paper, we first study the error-correcting performance of the 3D Chamon code, which is an instance of 3D XYZ product of three repetition codes. Next, we show that 3D XYZ product can be generalized to four dimension and propose four-dimensional (4D) XYZ product code construction, which constructs a class of non-CSS codes by using either four classical codes or two CSS codes. Compared with 4D homological product, we show that 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with higher code dimension or code distance. Finally, we consider two instances of 4D XYZ product, to which we refer as 4D Chamon code and 4D XYZ product concatenated code, respectively. Our simulation results show that, 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with better error-correcting performance for $Z$-biased noise than CSS codes constructed by 4D homological product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body lattice systems via spectra of momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions due to an almost conserved operator. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Energy Teleportation using a 3-Qubit System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 35.4% (observing only V ) by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state hamiltonian H to achieve this, that conforms the constraints of Zero mean energy and anti-commutative properties of the operations on the observable of the senders and receiver. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in energy retrieval, achieving an average efficiency of 65.5% (observing only V ), which is significantly higher than that of the 2-qubit system regarding practical usage. This advancement not only marks a step forward in practical quantum energy applications but also provides a new framework for future research in quantum energy teleportation and related quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We study the half system entanglement Hamiltonians of the ground state of free fermion critical transverse field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of defects. In general, we see that these defects introduce non-local terms into the entanglement Hamiltonian with the largest being couplings across the defect that decay with distance. It is also shown that the entanglement Hamiltonian does know of the defect even if the defect is outside of the subsystem. We also discuss what happens when defects are on the boundaries of the subsystem, and in particular, we investigate the behavior as the bond leading into the subsystem is cut. Finally, we examine the non-local behavior of the antiperiodic defect and duality defect, both of which introduce zero modes.</description>

Abstract: Reactive angular distributions of the benchmark F + H2(vi = 0) -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction show unusual propensity towards small scattering angles, a subject of a long debate in the literature. We use Regge trajectories to quantify the resonance contributions to state-to-state differential cross sections. Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F +H2 system and its isotopic variant F +HD. For our detailed analysis of angular scattering we employ the package DCS Regge, recently developed for the purpose [Comp. Phys. Comm., 2022, 277, 108370.]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computing emerges as one of leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage. However, a prevailing challenge is the coding overhead due to limited quantum connectivity, constrained by nearest-neighbor coupling among superconducting qubits. Here, we propose a novel multimode coupling scheme using three resonators driven by two microwaves, based on the resonator-induced phase gate, to extend the $ZZ$ interaction distance between qubits. We demonstrate a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 99.9\% within 160 ns at free spectral range (FSR) of 1.4 GHz, and by optimizing driving pulses, we further reduce the residual photon to nearly $10^{-3}$ within 100 ns at FSR of 0.2 GHz. These facilitate the long-range CZ gate over separations reaching sub-meters, thus significantly enhancing qubit connectivity and making a practical step towards the scalable integration and modularization of quantum processors. Specifically, our approach supports the implementation of quantum error correction codes requiring high connectivity, such as low-density parity check codes that paves the way to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Time Derivatives of Weak Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time derivative of a physical property often gives rise to another meaningful property. Since weak values provide empirical insights that cannot be derived from expectation values, this paper explores what physical properties can be obtained from the time derivative of weak values. It demonstrates that, in general, the time derivative of a gauge-invariant weak value is neither a weak value nor a gauge-invariant quantity. Two conditions are presented to ensure that the left- or right-time derivative of a weak value is also a gauge-invariant weak value. Under these conditions, a local Ehrenfest-like theorem can be derived for weak values giving a natural interpretation for the time derivative of weak values. Notably, a single measured weak value of the system's position provides information about two additional unmeasured weak values: the system's local velocity and acceleration, through the first- and second-order time derivatives of the initial weak value, respectively. These findings also offer guidelines for experimentalists to translate the weak value theory into practical laboratory setups, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies. An example illustrates how the electromagnetic field can be determined at specific positions and times from the first- and second-order time derivatives of a weak value of position.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Emergent Massive Nambu-Goldstone Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, achieves a better convergence behavior compared to the basic QNG. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/borbysh/Momentum-QNG</description>

      <title>Discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution secure against general attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (DM-CV-QKD) has gained traction due to its practical advantages: cost-effectiveness, simple state preparation, and compatibility with existing communication technologies. This work presents a security analysis of DM-CV-QKD against general sequential attacks, including finite-size effects. Remarkably, our proof considers attacks that are neither independent nor identical, and makes no assumptions about the Hilbert space dimension of the receiver. To analyse the security, we leverage the recent generalised entropy accumulation theorem and the numerical methods based on quasi-relative entropy. We also develop a novel dimension reduction technique which is compatible with the entropy accumulation framework. While our analysis reveals significant finite-size corrections to the key rate, the protocol might still offer advantages in specific scenarios due to its practical merits. Our work also offers some insights on how future security proofs can improve the security bounds derived in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal machines are physical systems specifically designed to make thermal energy available for practical use through state transformations in a cyclic process. This concept relies on the presence of an additional element equipped with a clock, controlling which interaction Hamiltonian between the system and the reservoirs must act at a certain time and that remains unaffected during this process. In the domain of quantum dynamics, there is substantial evidence to suggest that fulfilling this final condition is, in fact, impossible, except in ideal and far-from-reality cases. In this study we start from one such idealized condition and proceed to relax the primary approximations to make the model more realistic and less ideal. The main result is a fully quantum description of the engine-clock dynamics within a realistic quantum framework. Furthermore, this approach offers the possibility to address the deeper and more fundamental challenge of defining meaningful time operators in the realm of quantum mechanics from a different standpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate qubit measurement remains a critical challenge on the path to fault-tolerant quantum computing. In superconducting quantum circuits, fast qubit measurement has been achieved using a dispersively coupled resonator with a large external linewidth. This necessitates the use of a Purcell filter that protects the qubit from relaxation through the readout channel. Here we show that a readout resonator and filter resonator, coupled to each other both capacitively and inductively, can produce a compact notch-filter circuit that effectively eliminates the Purcell decay channel through destructive interference. By utilizing linewidths as large as 42 MHz, we perform 56-ns simultaneous readout of four qubits and benchmark an average assignment fidelity of 99.77%, with the highest qubit assignment fidelity exceeding 99.9%. These results demonstrate a significant advancement in speed and fidelity for multiplexed superconducting qubit readout.</description>

      <title>A non-relativistic Dirac equation: An application to photo ionization of highly charged hydrogen-like ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.00646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of relativity in photo ionization of hydrogen-like ions by a laser pulse. For hydrogen, the wavelengths of the laser resides in the weakly ultra violet region. For higher nuclear charges, the laser parameters are scaled in a manner which renders the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the dipole approximation independent of nuclear charge. The ionization potentials of these highly charged ions are strongly modified by relativistic effects. In an earlier work, Ivanova et al., Phys. Rev. A {\bf 98}, 063402 (2018), it is demonstrated how this explains most of the relativistic correction to the ionization probability. Here we investigate to what extent remaining discrepancies can be attributed to relativistic effects stemming from the strong external field. To this end, we solve semi-relativistic formulations of both the Schr{\"o}dinger and the Dirac equations; the former accounts for increased inertia due to the external laser field, while the latter features a non-relativistic interaction term.</description>

Abstract: We extend algorithmic conservation inequalities to probability measures. The amount of self information of a probability measure cannot increase when submitted to randomized processing. This includes (potentially non-computable) measures over finite sequences, infinite sequences, and $T_0$, second countable topologies. One example is the convolution of signals over real numbers with probability kernels. Thus the smoothing of any signal due We show that given a quantum measurement, for an overwhelming majority of pure states, no meaningful information is produced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a self-contained thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density interactions on two-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped) phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes, these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases, which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square and triangular lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators, e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering novel emergent behavior in quantum many-body systems is a main objective of contemporary research. In this paper, we explore the effects on phases and phase transitions of the proximity to a Ruelle-Fisher instability, marking the transition to a collapsed state. To accomplish this, we study by quantum Monte Carlo simulations a two-dimensional system of soft-core bosons interacting through an isotropic finite-ranged attraction, with a parameter $\eta$ describing its strength. If $\eta$ exceeds a characteristic value $\eta_c$, the thermodynamic limit is lost, as the system becomes unstable against collapse. We investigate the phase diagram of the model for $\eta\lesssim\eta_c$, finding -- in addition to a liquid-vapor transition -- a first-order transition between two liquid phases. Upon cooling, the high-density liquid turns superfluid, possibly above the vapor-liquid-liquid triple temperature. As $\eta$ approaches $\eta_c$, the stability region of the high-density liquid is shifted to increasingly higher densities, a behavior at variance with distinguishable quantum or classical particles. Finally, for $\eta$ larger than $\eta_c$ our simulations yield evidence of collapse of the low-temperature fluid for any density; the collapsed system forms a circular cluster whose radius is insensitive to the number of particles.</description>

      <title>Quantization of optical quasinormal modes for spatially separated cavity systems with finite retardation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes (QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the root structure of coupled cluster equations holds both foundational and practical significance for computational quantum chemistry. This study provides insight into the intricate root structures of these non-linear equations at both the CCD and CCSD level of theory. We utilize computational techniques from algebraic geometry, specifically the monodromy and parametric homotopy continuation methods, to calculate the full solution set. We compare the computed CC roots against various established theoretical upper bounds, shedding light on the accuracy and efficiency of these bounds. We hereby focus on the dissociation processes of four-electron systems such as (H$_2$)$_2$ in both D$_{2{\rm h}}$ and D$_{\infty {\rm h}}$ configurations, H$_4$ symmetrically distorted on a circle, and lithium hydride. We moreover investigate the ability of single-reference coupled cluster solutions to approximate excited state energies. We find that multiple CC roots describe energies of excited states with high accuracy. Our investigations reveal that for systems like lithium hydride, CC not only provides high-accuracy approximations to several excited state energies but also to the states themselves.</description>

Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising materials for classical and quantum light sources due to their versatile chemistry and efficient photoluminescence (PL) properties. While visible emitters are well-established, the pursuit of excellent (near-)infrared sources continues. One notable candidate in this regard are photoluminescent two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibiting excitonic emission at 720 nm (1.7 eV) directly tying to the typical emission range limit of CdSe NPLs. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of low-temperature PL from this material class. Ultrathin 2D PbS NPLs exhibit high crystallinity confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and revealing Moire patterns in overlapping structures. At 4K, we observe unique PL features in single PbS NPLs, including narrow zero-phonon lines with line widths down to 0.6 meV and a linear degree of polarization up to 90%. Time-resolved measurements identify trions as the dominant emission source with a 2.3 ns decay time. Sub-meV spectral diffusion and no immanent blinking over minutes is observed, as well as discrete spectral jumps without memory effects. These findings advance the understanding and underpin the potential of colloidal PbS NPLs for optical and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the algebra of Parisi ultrametric matrices is recovered by the real-time, replica-free, Dyson-Keldysh equations of infinite-range quantum spin glasses in the late time glassy limit. This connects to earlier results on classical and quantum systems showing how ultrametricity emerges from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. The stationary spin glass state thereby spontaneously breaks thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We describe the Keldysh path integral of the infinite-range Ising model in transverse and longitudinal fields, and in the context of the Landau expansion of the action functional, show how the long-time limit connects to the full replica symmetry breaking obtained in the equilibrium formalism. We also illustrate our formalism by applying it to the spherical quantum $p$-spin model, which only exhibits one-step replica symmetry breaking</description>

      <title>Energy Transport Among Highly-Polarized Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A static electric field of a few V/cm shifts the energy levels of ultracold Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. For a given principle quantum number, most of the energy levels are nearly degenerate at zero field and fan out with increasing field to form a manifold. We excite Rydberg atoms to energy levels near the center of the manifold, where the spacing is nearly harmonic, and allow them to exchange energy via resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We measure the time evolution as energy spreads away from the center of the manifold, which reveals that the system fails to thermalize for long interaction times. A computational model that includes only a few essential features of the system qualitatively agrees with this result.</description>

      <title>Entanglement content of kink excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum one-dimensional systems in their ordered phase admit kinks as elementary excitations above their symmetry-broken vacua. While the scattering properties of the kinks resemble those of quasiparticles, they have distinct locality features that are manifest in their entanglement content. In this work, we study the entanglement entropy of kink excitations. We first present detailed calculations for specific states of a spin-1/2 chain to highlight the salient features of these excitations. Second, we provide a field-theoretic framework based on the algebraic relations between the twist fields and the semilocal fields associated with the excitations, and we compute the R\'enyi entropies in this framework. We obtain universal predictions for the entropy difference between the excited states with a finite number of kinks and the symmetry-broken ground states, which do not depend on the microscopic details of the model in the limit of large regions. Finally, we discuss some consequences of the Kramers-Wannier duality, which relates the ordered and disordered phases of the Ising model, and we explain why, counterintuitively, no explicit relations between those phases are found at the level of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a continuous superradiant laser on the sub-mHz $^1$S$_0\,\rightarrow\,^3$P$_0$ transition in neutral strontium-88</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous superradiance using a narrow optical transition has the potential to improve the short-term stability of state-of-the-art optical clocks. Even though pulsed superradiant emission on a mHz linewidth clock transition has been shown, true continuous operation, without Fourier limitation, has turned out to be extremely challenging. The trade-off between maintaining a high atomic flux while minimizing decoherence effects presents a significant obstacle. Here, we discuss the design of a machine that could overcome this problem by combining a high-flux continuous beam of ultra cold strontium atoms with a bowtie cavity for the generation of superradiant lasing. To evaluate the feasibility of our design, we present simulation results for continuous high-efficiency cooling, loading, and pumping to the upper lasing state inside the bowtie cavity. We then present two different models for stimulating the generated superradiant field by taking into account position-dependent shifts, collisional decoherence, light shifts, and atom loss. Finally, we estimate a laser linewidth of less than 100 mHz, limited by atom number fluctuations, and resulting in an output power of hundreds of fW.</description>
