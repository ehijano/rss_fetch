      <title>NEURODNAAI: Neural pipeline approaches for the advancing dna-based information storage as a sustainable digital medium using deep learning framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA is a promising medium for digital information storage for its exceptional density and durability. While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text and images. By unifying theory, workflow, and simulation into one pipeline, NeuroDNAAI enables scalable, biologically valid archival DNA storage</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Tradeoff Exploration for Component Placement and Wire Routing in Nanomodular Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in fabrication technology have enabled modularizing electronic components at the micro- or nano-scale and composing these modules on demand into larger circuits. Micromodular and nanomodular electronics (ME and NE) open a new design space in electronics, promising a degree of flexibility, extensibility, and accessibility far superior to traditional monolithic methods. ME/NE leverage a multi-stage process of initial imprecise component deposition, followed by precise wire printing to compose them into a circuit. Due to imperfections in deposition, each circuit instance has a unique layout with its own component placement and wire routing solutions, putting the design automation process on the critical path. Moreover, high-performance nanomodular components enable the synthesis of larger heterogeneous circuits than traditional printed electronics, requiring more scalable algorithms. ME/NE thus introduce a tradeoff between the time-to-solution for placement/routing algorithms and the resulting total wire length, with the latter dictating circuit printing time. We explore this tradeoff by adapting standard partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing algorithms to the unique characteristics of ME/NE. Our evaluations demonstrate significant optimization headroom in different dimensions. For example, our tunable algorithms can deliver a $108\times$ improvement in end-to-end manufacturing time at the cost of $21\%$ increase in total wire length. Conversely, circuit quality/performance can be prioritized at the cost of increased manufacturing time, highlighting the value of the ability to dynamically navigate the tradeoff space according to the primary optimization metric.</description>
