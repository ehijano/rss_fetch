      <title>Computational Irreducibility as the Foundation of Agency: A Formal Model Connecting Undecidability to Autonomous Behavior in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a "minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments. Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction, offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI, and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally irreducible universe.</description>

      <title>Gap-preserving reductions and RE-completeness of independent set games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complexity theory, gap-preserving reductions play a crucial role in studying hardness of approximation and in analyzing the relative complexity of multiprover interactive proof systems. In the quantum setting, multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise problems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP$^*$=RE (Ji et al., arXiv:2001.04383) shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP$^*$ is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP$^*$-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same problem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out our reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of independent interest, allowing us to perturb families of almost PVMs to genuine PVMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1601.03619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The method for analyzing algorithmic runtime complexity using decision trees is discussed using the sorting algorithm. This method is then extended to optimal algorithms which may find all cliques of size q in network N, or simply the first clique of size q in network N. Finally, the lower bound of such decision trees is demonstrated to not be in P.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Expressive Delegations: Complexity and Normative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider binary group decision-making under a rich model of liquid democracy recently proposed by Colley, Grandi, and Novaro (2022): agents submit ranked delegation options, where each option may be a function of multiple agents' votes; e.g., "I vote yes if a majority of my friends vote yes." Such ballots are unravelled into a profile of direct votes by selecting one entry from each ballot so as not to introduce cyclic dependencies. We study delegation via monotonic Boolean functions, and two unravelling procedures: MinSum, which minimises the sum of the ranks of the chosen entries, and its egalitarian counterpart, MinMax. We provide complete computational dichotomies: MinSum is hard to compute (and approximate) as soon as any non-trivial functions are permitted, and polynomial otherwise; for MinMax the easiness results extend to arbitrary-arity logical ORs and ANDs taken in isolation, but not beyond. For the classic model of delegating to individual agents, we give asymptotically near-tight algorithms for carrying out the two procedures and efficient algorithms for finding optimal unravellings with the highest vote count for a given alternative. These algorithms inspire novel tie-breaking rules for the setup of voting to change a status quo. We then introduce a new axiom, which can be viewed as a variant of the participation axiom, and use algorithmic techniques developed earlier in the paper to show that it is satisfied by MinSum and a lexicographic refinement of MinMax (but not MinMax itself).</description>
