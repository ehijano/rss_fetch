      <title>Compression of Higher Order Ambisonics with Multichannel RVQGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbit/s.</description>

      <title>Zoomed In, Diffused Out: Towards Local Degradation-Aware Multi-Diffusion for Extreme Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale, pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have gained significant popularity in image generation tasks and have shown unexpected potential in image Super-Resolution (SR). However, most existing T2I diffusion models are trained with a resolution limit of 512x512, making scaling beyond this resolution an unresolved but necessary challenge for image SR. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that, for the first time, enables these models to generate 2K, 4K, and even 8K images without any additional training. Our method leverages MultiDiffusion, which distributes the generation across multiple diffusion paths to ensure global coherence at larger scales, and local degradation-aware prompt extraction, which guides the T2I model to reconstruct fine local structures according to its low-resolution input. These innovations unlock higher resolutions, allowing T2I diffusion models to be applied to image SR tasks without limitation on resolution.</description>

      <title>MTFusion: Reconstructing Any 3D Object from Single Image Using Multi-word Textual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D models from single-view images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. The latest advances for single-image 3D reconstruction extract a textual description from the input image and further utilize it to synthesize 3D models. However, existing methods focus on capturing a single key attribute of the image (e.g., object type, artistic style) and fail to consider the multi-perspective information required for accurate 3D reconstruction, such as object shape and material properties. Besides, the reliance on Neural Radiance Fields hinders their ability to reconstruct intricate surfaces and texture details. In this work, we propose MTFusion, which leverages both image data and textual descriptions for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we adopt a novel multi-word textual inversion technique to extract a detailed text description capturing the image's characteristics. Then, we use this description and the image to generate a 3D model with FlexiCubes. Additionally, MTFusion enhances FlexiCubes by employing a special decoder network for Signed Distance Functions, leading to faster training and finer surface representation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our MTFusion surpasses existing image-to-3D methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world images. Furthermore, the ablation study proves the effectiveness of our network designs.</description>

      <title>Generative Timelines for Instructed Visual Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to manipulate visual timelines (e.g. a video) through natural language instructions, making complex timeline editing tasks accessible to non-expert or potentially even disabled users. We call this task Instructed visual assembly. This task is challenging as it requires (i) identifying relevant visual content in the input timeline as well as retrieving relevant visual content in a given input (video) collection, (ii) understanding the input natural language instruction, and (iii) performing the desired edits of the input visual timeline to produce an output timeline. To address these challenges, we propose the Timeline Assembler, a generative model trained to perform instructed visual assembly tasks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we develop a large multimodal language model, which is designed to process visual content, compactly represent timelines and accurately interpret timeline editing instructions. Second, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating datasets for visual assembly tasks, enabling efficient training of our model without the need for human-labeled data. Third, we validate our approach by creating two novel datasets for image and video assembly, demonstrating that the Timeline Assembler substantially outperforms established baseline models, including the recent GPT-4o, in accurately executing complex assembly instructions across various real-world inspired scenarios.</description>

      <title>Structured Multi-Track Accompaniment Arrangement via Style Prior Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of music AI, arranging rich and structured multi-track accompaniments from a simple lead sheet presents significant challenges. Such challenges include maintaining track cohesion, ensuring long-term coherence, and optimizing computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel system that leverages prior modelling over disentangled style factors to address these challenges. Our method presents a two-stage process: initially, a piano arrangement is derived from the lead sheet by retrieving piano texture styles; subsequently, a multi-track orchestration is generated by infusing orchestral function styles into the piano arrangement. Our key design is the use of vector quantization and a unique multi-stream Transformer to model the long-term flow of the orchestration style, which enables flexible, controllable, and structured music generation. Experiments show that by factorizing the arrangement task into interpretable sub-stages, our approach enhances generative capacity while improving efficiency. Additionally, our system supports a variety of music genres and provides style control at different composition hierarchies. We further show that our system achieves superior coherence, structure, and overall arrangement quality compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition. The code, data and models are available at https://github.com/Hoar012/RAP-MLLM.</description>
