      <title>Extra force in charged resonant capacitors: a new macroscopic effect of vacuum fluctuations ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on measurements of the mechanical vibrations of the fundamental mode of resonant capacitive transducers, consisting of parallel plates at different gaps (10 - 26 $\mu$m). Resonant frequency data were taken vs the electric field at constant charge, at various temperatures and different configurations. All measurements exhibited unexpectedly large tuning, caused by an additional, unpredicted attractive force. Such force has a divergent behaviour characterized by a critical electrical field and start to diverge long before the critical point. Many known physical mechanisms have been considered to explain this force, but all of them had to be discarded. Thus, we turn to non-conventional physical mechanisms and suggest that vacuum fluctuations inside the gap could be a possible cause of this anomalous force.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the general-spin Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by modelling in physics and other disciplines, such as sociology and psychology, we derive the mean field of the general-spin Ising model from the variational principle of the Gibbs free energy. The general-spin Ising model has $2k+1$ spin values, generated by $-(k-j)/k$, with $j=0,1,2\ldots,2k$, such that for $k=1$ we obtain $-1,0,1$, for example; the Hamiltonian is identical to that of the standard Ising model. The general-spin Ising model exhibits spontaneous magnetisation, similar to the standard Ising model, but with the location translated by a factor depending on the number of categories $2k+1$. We also show how the accuracy of the mean field depends on both the number of nodes and node degree, and that the hysteresis effect decreases and saturates with the number of categories $2k+1$. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Plasma Frequency of Wire Medium Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits a model for the plasma frequency of a simple wire medium formed by a rectangular lattice of parallel metallic wires. We provide a comparative analysis of existing formulae for estimating the plasma frequency and derive a new expression. The proposed formula demonstrates superior accuracy for a square lattice of thin wires, with a relative error of less than $0.16\%$ for the ratio of wires radii to period smaller than $0.13$, significantly outperforming previously known results in this range. For rectangular lattices with the periods ratio from $2$ to $10$ the new formula provides estimations with a relative error less than $2.7\%$ for the ratio of wires radii to the smaller period less than $0.4$.</description>

      <title>Coupled Dipole Oscillation Enabled Scintillation Compensation in Turbulence-Impacted Laser Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work develops a rigorous framework for collective dipole oscillations in dense dielectric media by extending the Lorentz oscillator model to include both quadratic (second order) and cubic (third order) nonlinear restoring forces. Dipole-dipole interactions are incorporated via the dyadic Greens function, leading to a nonlocal description of the medium. Starting from the generalised oscillator equation, the system is expressed in matrix form with an effective stiffness matrix. Using a harmonic steady state ansatz, nonlinear terms are approximated in the frequency domain. Diagonalisation provides collective normal modes, which serve as a basis for perturbative expansion zeroth order captures the linear response, while higher orders describe nonlinear corrections. The polarisation is expressed through corrected mode amplitudes, yielding an effective nonlinear nonlocal susceptibility kernel. Finally, the scalar Greens function formalism is applied to derive the structured output field. These approaches bridge microscopic dipole dynamics with macroscopic optical propagation, offering key insights into nonlinear light matter interaction and turbulence influenced field evolution.</description>
