      <title>R-matrix with time-dependence calculations for three-sideband RABBITT in helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following up on a recent paper [Bharti et al., Phys. Rev. A 109 (2024) 023110], we compare the predictions from severalR-matrix with time-dependence calculations for a modified three-sideband version of the "reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions" (RABBITT) configuration applied to helium. Except for the special case of the threshold sideband, which appears to be very sensitive to the details of coupling to the bound Rydberg states, increasing the number of coupled states in the close-coupling expansion used to describe the ejected-electron--residual-ion interaction hardly changes the results. Consequently, the remaining discrepancies between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions are likely due to uncertainties in the experimental parameters, particularly the detailed knowledge of the laser pulse.</description>

      <title>High Compression Blue-Detuned Magneto-Optical Trap of Polyatomic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a blue-detuned magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a polyatomic molecule, calcium monohydroxide (CaOH). We identify a novel MOT frequency configuration that produces high spatial compression of the molecular cloud. This high compression MOT achieves a cloud radius of $59(5)~\mu\text{m}$ and a peak density of $8(2) \times 10^8~\text{cm}^{-3}$, the highest reported density for a molecular MOT to date. We compare our experimental studies of blue-detuned MOTs for CaOH and compare with Monte-Carlo simulations, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Collective coupling of driven multilevel atoms and its effect on four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic models based on multilevel atoms are central to controlling non-linear optical responses and coherent control of light. These models are traditionally based on single-atom responses that are then parametrically extrapolated to include collective effects, such as an enhanced response or propagation within the medium. In this work we present a systematic analysis of the cooperative effects arising in driven systems composed of multi-level atoms coupled by a common electromagnetic environment. The analysis is based on an interplay between dressed states induced by the driving field, photon exchanges, and the collective decay channels. This theory is applied to the case of four-wave mixing mediated by a pair of atoms in the diamond configuration, a nonlinear process commonly used to create correlated photon pairs. The effects of inter-atomic correlations and collective decay channels over outgoing photons are then explored. We find that the resulting correlation function changes from a Lorentzian distribution for independent atoms to a two-peaked distribution when dipole-dipole interactions are included. The two-peak structure is related to a joint action between the dressed states and the collective decay channels. Signatures of these processes are identified for existing experimental realizations. The intuition obtained from this connection helps to uncover relevant parameters that could be exploited for quantum control protocols based on dispersive and dissipative cooperative effects in multi-level systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial Wavefunctions of Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanical angular momentum, based on spatial wavefunctions that depend on the Euler angles $\phi, \theta, \chi$. The wavefunctions are Wigner D-functions, $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$, for which the body-fixed projection quantum number $n$ has the unusual value $n=|j|=\sqrt{j(j+1)}$, or $n=0$. The $D_{\sqrt{j(j+1)},m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ wavefunctions are unnormalizable, however we demonstrate a renormalization procedure that allows the calculation of expectation values: for example, the states $D_{\sqrt{S(S+1)} M}^S (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ of elementary particles with spin $S$ give a gyromagnetic ratio of $g=2$ for $S&gt;0$, and we identify these as the spatial angular-momentum wavefunctions of known fundamental charged particles with spin. Therefore, we make the case that the $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ are useful as spatial wavefunctions for angular momentum. Some implications of the quantum number $n$ for fundamental particles are discussed, such as the proposed Dirac-fermion nature of the neutrino, and some proposed dark-matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>
