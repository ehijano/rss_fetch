      <title>Black-Litterman and ESG Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple portfolio optimization strategy using ESG data with the Black-Litterman allocation framework. ESG scores are used as a bias for Stein shrinkage estimation of equilibrium risk premiums used in assigning Black-Litterman asset weights. Assets are modeled as multivariate affine normal-inverse Gaussian variables using CVaR as a risk measure. This strategy, though very simple, when employed with a soft turnover constraint is exceptionally successful. Portfolios are reallocated daily over a 4.7 year period, each with a different set of hyperparameters used for optimization. The most successful strategies have returns of approximately 40-45% annually.</description>

      <title>Signature approach for pricing and hedging path-dependent options with frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel signature approach for pricing and hedging path-dependent options with instantaneous and permanent market impact under a mean-quadratic variation criterion. Leveraging the expressive power of signatures, we recast an inherently nonlinear and non-Markovian stochastic control problem into a tractable form, yielding hedging strategies in (possibly infinite) linear feedback form in the time-augmented signature of the control variables, with coefficients characterized by non-standard infinite-dimensional Riccati equations on the extended tensor algebra. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these signature-based strategies for pricing and hedging general path-dependent payoffs in the presence of frictions. In particular, market impact naturally smooths optimal trading strategies, making low-truncated signature approximations highly accurate and robust in frictional markets, contrary to the frictionless case.</description>

      <title>Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prices: Evidence from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines factors that influence prices of most common five cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero over 2010-2018 using weekly data. The study employs ARDL technique and documents several findings. First, cryptomarket-related factors such as market beta, trading volume, and volatility appear to be significant determinant for all five cryptocurrencies both in short- and long-run. Second, attractiveness of cryptocurrencies also matters in terms of their price determination, but only in long-run. This indicates that formation (recognition) of the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies are subjected to time factor. In other words, it travels slowly within the market. Third, SP500 index seems to have weak positive long-run impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litcoin, while its sign turns to negative losing significance in short-run, except Bitcoin that generates an estimate of -0.20 at 10% significance level. Lastly, error-correction models for Bitcoin, Etherem, Dash, Litcoin, and Monero show that cointegrated series cannot drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a speed of 23.68%, 12.76%, 10.20%, 22.91%, and 14.27% respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimal vs. Naive Diversification in the Cryptocurrencies Market: The Role of Time-Varying Moments and Transaction Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates three central questions in portfolio optimization. First, whether time-varying moment estimators outperform conventional sample estimators in practical portfolio construction. Second, whether incorporating a turnover penalty into the optimization objective can improve out-of-sample performance. Third, what type of optimal portfolio strategies can consistently outperform the naive 1/N benchmark. Using empirical evidence from the cryptocurrencies market, this paper provides comprehensive answers to these questions. In the process, several additional findings are uncovered, offering further insights into the dynamics of portfolio construction in highly volatile asset classes.</description>
