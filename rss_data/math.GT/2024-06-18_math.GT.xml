      <title>The necessity of (co)unit in nearly Frobenius algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we concern the concept of nearly Frobenius algebra, which corresponds to most 2D-TQFT of which each cobordism admits no critical points of index 0 or 2. We prove that any nearly Frobenius algebra over a principal ideal domain with surjective multiplication and injective comultiplication is indeed a Frobenius algebra. The motivation of this study mainly emanates from the investigation of potential constructions of link homology.</description>

      <title>Extensions of finitely generated Veech groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed surface $S$ with finitely generated Veech group $G$ and its $\pi_1(S)$-extension $\Gamma$, there exists a hyperbolic space $\hat{E}$ on which $\Gamma$ acts isometrically and cocompactly. The space $\hat{E}$ is obtained by collapsing some regions of the surface bundle over the convex hull of the limit set of $G$. Using the nice action of $\Gamma$ on the hyperbolic space $\hat{E}$, it is shown that $\Gamma$ is hierarchically hyperbolic. These are generalizations of results from Dowdall-Durham-Leininger-Sisto, which assume in addition that $G$ is a lattice. Because finitely generated Veech groups are among the most basic examples of subgroups of mapping class groups which are expected to qualify as geometrically finite, this result is evidence for the development of a broader theory of geometric finiteness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any two minimal genus, oriented, boundary parallel surfaces bounded by a non-split alternating link into the 4-ball are smoothly isotopic fixing boundary. In other words, any two minimal genus Seifert surfaces for a non-split alternating link become smoothly isotopic fixing boundary once their interiors are pushed into the 4-ball.</description>

      <title>On localizing groups of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruberman in the 90's showed that the group of exotic diffeomorphisms of closed 4-manifolds can be infinitely generated. We provide various results on the question of when such infinite generation can localize to a smaller embedded submanifold of the original manifold. Our results include: (1) All known infinitely generated groups of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds detected by families Seiberg-Witten theory do not localize to any topologically (locally-flatly) embedded rational homology balls in the ambient 4-manifold. (2) Many exotic diffeomorphisms cannot be obtained as Dehn twists along homology spheres (under mild assumptions). (3) There is no contractible 4-manifolds with Seifert fibered boundary that have a universal property for exotic diffeomorphisms analogous to a universal cork. In addition, there is no universal compact 4-manifold $W$ such that the set of exotic diffeomorphisms of a 4-manifold can localize to an embedding of $W$. (4) Certain infinite generations of exotic diffeomorphism groups do localize to a non-compact subset $V$ with a small Betti number, but not to any compact subset of $V$. (5) An analogous result holds for mapping class groups of 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The systole of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the systole of a model of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds introduced by Petri and Raimbault, answering a question posed in that same article. These are compact manifolds with boundary constructed by randomly gluing truncated tetrahedra along their faces. We prove that the limit, as the volume tends to infinity, of the expected value of their systole exists and we give a closed formula of it. Moreover, we compute a numerical approximation of this value.</description>

      <title>Non-freeness of parabolic two-generator groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complex number $\lambda$ is said to be non-free if the subgroup of $SL(2,\bc)$ generated by $$X=\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp; 1\\ 0 &amp; 1
  \end{pmatrix} \,\, \text{and}\,\,\,Y_{\lambda}=\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp; 0\\ \lambda &amp; 1
  \end{pmatrix}$$ is not a free group of rank 2. In this case the number $\lambda$ is called a relation number, and it has been a long standing problem to determine the relation numbers. In this paper, we characterize the relation numbers by establishing the equivalence between $\lambda$ being a relation number and $u:=\sqrt{- \lambda}$ being a root of a `generalized Chebyshev polynomial'. The generalized Chebyshev polynomials of degree $k$ are given by a sequence of $k$ integers $(n_1, n_2,\cdots, n_k)$ using the usual recursive formula, and thereby can be studied systematically using continuants and continued fractions. Such formulation, then, enables us to prove that, the question whether a given number $\lambda$ is a relation number of $u$-degree $k$ can be answered by checking only finitely many generalized Chebyshev polynomials. Based on these theorems, we design an algorithm deciding any given number is a relation number with minimal degree $k$. With its computer implementation we provide a few sample examples, with a particular emphasis on the well known conjecture that every rational number in the interval $(-4, 4)$ is a relation number.</description>

      <title>Exact quadratic growth for the derivatives of iterates of interval diffeomorphisms with only parabolic fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $C^2$ diffeomorphisms of a closed interval with only parabolic fixed points. We show that the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates of such a diffeomorphism is exactly quadratic provided it has a non quadratically tangency to the identity at a fixed point that is topologically repelling on one side. Moreover, in absence of such fixed points, the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates is subquadratic.</description>

Abstract: We give a 4-dimensional light bulb theorem for properly embedded disks, generalizing recent work of Gabai and Kosanovic-Teichner in certain contexts, and extending the 4-dimensional light bulb theorem for 2-spheres due to Gabai and Schneiderman-Teichner. In particular, we provide conditions under which homotopic disks properly embedded in a compact 4-manifold X with a common dual in the interior of X are smoothly isotopic rel boundary. We also provide a new geometric interpretation of the Dax invariant, to aid in its computation.</description>

      <title>Diffeotopy groups of non-compact 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide information on diffeotopy groups of exotic smoothings of punctured 4-manifolds, extending previous results on diffeotopy groups of exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s. In particular, we prove that for a smoothable 4-manifold $M$ and for a non-empty, discrete set of points $S \subsetneq \mathring{M}$, there are uncountably many distinct smoothings of $M\smallsetminus S$ whose diffeotopy groups are uncountable.
  We then prove that for a smoothable 4-manifold $M$ and for a non-empty, discrete set of points $S \subsetneq \mathring{M}$, there exists a smoothing of $M\smallsetminus S$ whose diffeotopy groups have similar properties as $\mathcal{R}_U$, Freedman and Taylor's universal $\mathbb{R}^4$.
  Moreover, we prove that if $M$ is non-smoothable, both results still hold under the assumption that $|S| \ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: We describe an algorithm that takes as input an open book decomposition of a closed oriented 4-manifold and outputs an explicit trisection diagram of that 4-manifold. Moreover, a slight variation of this algorithm also works for open books on manifolds with non-empty boundary and for 3-manifold bundles over the circle. We apply this algorithm to several simple open books, demonstrate that it is compatible with various topological constructions, and argue that it generalizes and unifies several previously known constructions.</description>

Abstract: We prove an exact triangle relating knot instanton Floer homology to the instanton homology of surgeries along the knot. To the author's knowledge, this is the first such result in instanton homology with integer coefficients and has no analogue in Heegaard Floer homology. To illustrate the latter claim, we derive as a consequence of this triangle, building on previous computations in the literature, that the Poincar\'e Homology Sphere is not an instanton $L$-space with $\mathbb{Z}/2$-coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knot theory is a study of the embedding of closed circles into three-dimensional Euclidean space, motivated the ubiquity of knots in daily life and human civilization. However, the current knot theory focuses on the topology rather than metric. As such, the application of knot theory remains primitive and qualitative. Motivated by the need of quantitative knot data analysis (KDA), this work implements the metric into knot theory, the evolutionary Khovanov homology (EKH), to facilitate a multiscale KDA of real-world data. It is demonstrated that EKH exhibits non-trivial knot invariants at appropriate scales even if the global topological structure of a knot is simple. The proposed EKH has a great potential for KDA and knot learning.</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouc first studied the topological properties of the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, denoted by $M_n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Later Bj\"{o}rner et al. showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman. We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

Abstract: We prove that in the three dimensional sphere with a bumpy metric or a metric with positive Ricci curvature, there exist at least four distinct embedded minimal two-spheres. This confirms a conjecture of S. T. Yau in 1982 for bumpy metrics and metrics with positive Ricci curvature. The proof relies on a multiplicity one theorem for the Simon-Smith min-max theory.</description>

Abstract: For an embedded exact Lagrangian cobordism between Legendrian submanifolds in the 1-jet bundle, we prove that a generating family linear at infinity on the Legendrian at the negative end extends to a generating family linear at infinity on the Lagrangian cobordism after stabilization if and only if the formal obstructions vanish. In particular, a Lagrangian filling with trivial stable Lagrangian Gauss map admits a generating family linear at infinity.</description>

      <title>The quasi-isometry invariance of the Coset Intersection Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ consisting of a group and finite collection of subgroups, we introduce a simplicial $G$-complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ called the coset intersection complex. We prove that the quasi-isometry type and the homotopy type of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ are quasi-isometric invariants of the group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. Classical properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ correspond to topological or geometric properties of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$, such as having finite height, having finite width, being almost malnormal, admiting a malnormal core, or having thickness of order one. As applications, we obtain that a number of algebraic properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ are quasi-isometry invariants of the pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. For a certain class of right-angled Artin groups and their maximal parabolic subgroups, we show that the complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ is quasi-isometric to the Extension graph; in particular, it is quasi-isometric to a tree.</description>
