      <title>High sensitivity measurement of ULF, VLF and LF fields with Rydberg-atom sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fields with frequencies below megahertz are challenging for Rydberg-atom-based measurements, due to the low-frequency electric field screening effect that is caused by the alkali-metal atoms adsorbed on the inner surface of the container. In this paper, we investigate on electric fields measurements in the ULF, VLF and LF bands in a Cs vapor cell with built-in parallel electrodes. With optimization of the applied DC field, we achieve high-sensitive detection of the electric field at frequencies of 1kHz, 10kHz and 100kHz based on Rydberg-atom sensor, with the minimum electric field strength down to 18.0{\mu}V/cm, 6.9{\mu}V/cm and 3.0{\mu}V/cm, respectively. The corresponding sensitivity is 5.7 {\mu}V/cm/{\sqrt{Hz}}, 2.2{\mu}V/cm/{\sqrt{Hz}} and 0.95{\mu}V/cm/{\sqrt{Hz}} for ULF, VLF and LF fields, which is better than 1-cm dipole antenna. Besides, the linear dynamic range of Rydberg-atom sensor is over 50 dB. This work presents the potential to enable more applications that utilize atomic sensing technology in ULF, VLF and LF fields.</description>

      <title>Transition frequencies, isotope shifts, and hyperfine structure in $4s \rightarrow 4p$ transitions of Ti$^+$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured transition frequencies, isotope shifts and hyperfine structure splittings in the $3 d^{2}\left({ }^{3\!}F\right) 4 s\,{ }^{4} F_J\rightarrow 3 d^{2}\left({ }^{3\!} F\right) 4 p \,^{4} G_{J+1}$ transitions in Ti$^+$ ions for $J=\frac{3}{2},\, \frac{5}{2},\, \frac{7}{2}$ using collinear laser spectroscopy. Ions were generated by laser ablation in a buffer gas atmosphere and extracted into vacuum through a nozzle and a pair of radiofrequency (RF) funnels. The obtained results are of interest as reference values for on-line measurements of short-lived titanium isotopes and for astrophysical searches for temporal or spatial variations of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ using quasar absorption spectra.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis for Spatial Phase Reconstruction in Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are sensitive to a wide range of forces by encoding their signals in interference patterns of matter waves. To estimate the magnitude of these forces, the underlying phase shifts they imprint on the atoms must be extracted. Up until now, extraction algorithms typically rely on a fixed model of the patterns' spatial structure, which if inaccurate can lead to systematic errors caused by, for example, wavefront aberrations of the used lasers. In this paper we employ an algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis, which is capable of characterizing the spatial phase structure and per image phase offsets of an atom interferometer from a set of images. The algorithm does so without any prior knowledge about the specific spatial pattern as long as this pattern is the same for all images in the set. On simulated images with atom projection noise we show the algorithm's reconstruction performance follows distinct scaling laws, i.e., it is inversely-proportional to the square-root of the number atoms or the number of images respectively, which allows a projection of its performance for experiments. We also successfully extract the spatial phase patterns of two experimental data sets from an atom gravimeter. This algorithm is a first step towards a better understanding and complex spatial phase patterns, e.g., caused by inhomogeneous laser fields in atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Torsion-rotational transitions in methanol as a probe of fundamental physical constants -- electron and proton masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the using of torsion-rotational transitions in the CH3OH and (13)CH3OH molecules to evaluate possible variations of the physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - from spectral observations of emission lines detected in the microwave range towards the dense molecular cloud Orion-KL. An estimate of the upper limit on the relative changes in mu is obtained by two independent ways - with (13)CH3OH lines and with the combination of (13)CH3OH and CH3OH lines. The calculated upper limit Delta mu/mu &lt; 1.1*10^{-8} (1 sigma) is in line with the most stringent constraints on the variability of fundamental physical constants established by other astrophysical methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with atomic, molecular, and optical platforms for fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics has been at the forefront of the development of quantum science while laying the foundation for modern technology. With the growing capabilities of quantum control of many atoms for engineered many-body states and quantum entanglement, a key question emerges: what critical impact will the second quantum revolution with ubiquitous applications of entanglement bring to bear on fundamental physics?
  In this Essay, we argue that a compelling long-term vision for fundamental physics and novel applications is to harness the rapid development of quantum information science to define and advance the frontiers of measurement physics, with strong potential for fundamental discoveries.
  As quantum technologies, such as fault-tolerant quantum computing and entangled quantum sensor networks, become much more advanced than today's realization, we wonder what doors of basic science can these tools unlock? We anticipate that some of the most intriguing and challenging problems, such as quantum aspects of gravity, fundamental symmetries, or new physics beyond the minimal standard model, will be tackled at the emerging quantum measurement frontier.</description>

      <title>Photodissociation spectra of single trapped CaOH+ molecular ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular ions that are generated by chemical reactions with trapped atomic ions can serve as an accessible testbed for developing molecular quantum technologies. On the other hand, they are also a hindrance to scaling up quantum computers based on atomic ions as unavoidable reactions with background gas destroy the information carriers. Here, we investigate the single- and two-photon dissociation processes of single $\text{CaOH}^+$ molecular ions co-trapped in $\text{Ca}^+$ ion crystals using a femtosecond laser system. We report the photodissociation cross section spectra of $\text{CaOH}^+$ for single-photon processes at $\lambda=$245 - 275$\,$nm and for two-photon processes at $\lambda=$500 - 540$\,$nm. Measurements are interpreted with quantum-chemical calculations, which predict the photodissociation threshold for $\text{CaOH}^+\to \text{Ca}^++\text{OH}$ at 265$\,$nm. This result can serve as a basis for dissociation-based spectroscopy for studying the internal structure of $\text{CaOH}^+$. The result also gives a prescription for recycling $\text{Ca}^+$ ions in large-scale trapped $\text{Ca}^+$ quantum experiments from undesired $\text{CaOH}^+$ ions formed in the presence of background water vapor.</description>

      <title>Finite Pulse-Time Effects in Long-Baseline Quantum Clock Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-clock interferometry has been suggested as a quantum probe to test the universality of free fall (UFF) and the universality of gravitational redshift (UGR). In typical experimental schemes it seems advantageous to employ Doppler-free E1-M1 transitions which have so far been investigated in quantum gases at rest. Here, we consider the fully quantized atomic degrees of freedom and study the interplay of the quantum center-of-mass (COM) $-$ that can become delocalized $-$ together with the internal clock transitions. In particular, we derive a model for finite-time E1-M1 transitions with atomic intern-extern coupling and arbitrary position-dependent laser intensities. We further provide generalizations to the ideal expressions for perturbed recoilless clock pulses. Finally, we show at the example of a Gaussian laser beam that the proposed quantum-clock interferometers are stable against perturbations from varying optical fields for a sufficiently small quantum delocalization of the atomic COM.</description>
