      <title>How to Make an Action Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09294v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two actions in a decision problem, a and b, each of which produces a state-dependent monetary reward, we study how to robustly make action a more attractive. Action a' improves upon a in this manner if the set of beliefs at which a is preferred to b is a subset of the set of beliefs at which a' is preferred to b, irrespective of the risk-averse agent's utility function (in money). We provide a full characterization of this relation and discuss applications in politics, bilateral trade, insurance, and information acquisition.</description>

      <title>Monetizing digital content with network effects: A mechanism-design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design profit-maximizing mechanisms to sell an excludable and non-rival good with positive and/or negative network effects. Buyers have heterogeneous private values that depend on how many others also consume the good. In optimum, an endogenous number of the highest types consume the good, and we can implement this allocation in dominant strategies. We apply our insights to digital content creation, and we are able to rationalize features seen in monetization schemes in this industry such as voluntary contributions, community subsidies, and exclusivity bids.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design with Endogenous Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model endogenous perception of private information in single-agent screening problems, with potential evaluation errors. The agent's evaluation of their type depends on their cognitive state: either attentive (i.e., they correctly perceive their type) or inattentive (i.e., they might misperceive their type). The mechanism's incentives structure determines the agent's cognitive state via costly investment in cognition. We derive a general representation of attention incentives, show how they vary with the mechanism's allocation rule, and define a notion of accuracy of perception. In applications we showcase how perception both shapes and is shaped by the design of mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Using "Failure Costs" to Guarantee Execution Quality in Competitive and Permissionless Order Flow Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of decentralized blockchains, accurately simulating the outcome of order flow auctions (OFAs) off-chain is challenging due to adversarial sequencing, encrypted bids, and frequent state changes. Existing approaches, such as deterministic sorting via consensus layer modifications (e.g., MEV taxes) (Robinson and White 2024) and BRAID (Resnick 2024) or atomic execution of aggregated bids (e.g., Atlas) (Watts et al. 2024), remain vulnerable in permissionless settings where limited throughput allows rational adversaries to submit "spoof" bids that block their competitors' access to execution. We propose a new failure cost penalty that applies only when a solution is executed but does not pay its bid or fulfill the order. Combined with an on-chain escrow system, this mechanism empowers applications to asynchronously issue their users a guaranteed minimum outcome before the execution results are finalized. It implies a direct link between blockchain throughput, censorship resistance, and the capital efficiency of auction participants (e.g., solvers), which intuitively extends to execution quality. At equilibrium, bids fully reflect the potential for price improvement between bid submission and execution, but only partially reflect the potential for price declines. This asymmetry unbounded upside for winning bids, limited downside for failed bids, and no loss for losing bids - ultimately benefits users.</description>
