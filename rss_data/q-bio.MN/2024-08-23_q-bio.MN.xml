      <title>Extrinsic Fluctuations in the p53 Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations are inherent to biological systems, arising from the stochastic nature of molecular interactions, and influence various aspects of system behavior, stability, and robustness. These fluctuations can be categorized as intrinsic, stemming from the system's inherent structure and dynamics, and extrinsic, arising from external factors, such as temperature variations. Understanding the interplay between these fluctuations is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of biological phenomena. However, studying these effects poses significant computational challenges. In this study, we used an underexplored methodology to analyze the effect of extrinsic fluctuations in stochastic systems using ordinary differential equations instead of solving the Master Equation with stochastic parameters. By incorporating temperature fluctuations into reaction rates, we explored the impact of extrinsic factors on system dynamics. We constructed a master equation and calculated the equations for the dynamics of the first two moments, offering computational efficiency compared with directly solving the chemical master equation. We applied this approach to analyze a biological oscillator, focusing on the p53 model and its response to temperature-induced extrinsic fluctuations. Our findings underscore the impact of extrinsic fluctuations on the nature of oscillations in biological systems, with alterations in oscillatory behavior depending on the characteristics of extrinsic fluctuations. We observed an increased oscillation amplitude and frequency of the p53 concentration cycle. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of extrinsic fluctuations on biological oscillations and highlights the importance of considering them in more complex systems to prevent unwanted scenarios related to health issues.</description>

      <title>Corrected Hill Function in Stochastic Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing reaction rates in stochastic bio-circuits is commonly done by directly introducing the deterministically deduced Hill function into the master equation. However, when fluctuations in enzymatic reaction rates are not neglectable, the Hill function must be derived, considering all the involved stochastic reactions. In this work, we derived the stochastic version of the Hill function from the master equation of the complete set of reactions that, in the macroscopic limit, lead to the Hill function reaction rate. We performed a series expansion around the average values of the concentrations, which allowed us to find corrections for the deterministic Hill function. This process allowed us to quantify the fluctuations of enzymatic reactions. We found that the underlying variability in propensity rates of gene regulatory networks has an important non-linear effect that reduces the intrinsic fluctuations of the mRNA and protein concentrations.</description>
