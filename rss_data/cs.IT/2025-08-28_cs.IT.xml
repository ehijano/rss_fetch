      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Parity Shaping for Irregular Repeat-Accumulate LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms are presented that efficiently shape the parity bits of systematic irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by following the sequential encoding order of the accumulator. Simulations over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with on-off keying show a gain of up to 0.9 dB over uniform signaling.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of the Tail Sequence for Short LDPC-Coded Space Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to some standards for satellite communications, the transmitted stream is divided into transmission units with variable length, for which detecting the termination is particularly relevant. This is the case of space TeleCommands (TCs), where coded data are usually preceded by a start sequence, and optionally followed by a tail sequence, forming the Communication Link Transmission Unit (CLTU). Regarding the choice of schemes for error correction, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems recommendations for TC synchronization and coding suggests to use, among others, two Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes: one (relatively) long and one short. Adopting the long LDPC code eliminates the need for a tail sequence, as the LDPC decoder always fails when overrunning the end of the CLTU, thus causing the decoding and detection process to stop. This, however, is not true when the short LDPC code is adopted, since its decoding might converge on a codeword even when the decoder input is not a noisy codeword. This makes it necessary to use a tail sequence that causes the decoder to fail regardless of its input. In this paper, we study the features required for such a sequence and propose some methods for its design. Our numerical results, obtained considering various detection approaches for the tail sequence, show that the overall TC rejection probability improves significantly when the proposed tail sequence is employed. Our simulations also show that, for moderate values of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), with a properly designed tail sequence it is possible to obtain the same performance in terms of TC rejection probability using decoder-based detection and likelihood ratio test-based detection, with the former approach being less complex than the latter.</description>

      <title>Renyi partial orders for BISO channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in information theory is to quantify the loss of information under a noisy channel. Partial orders are typical tools to that end, however, they are often also challenging to evaluate. For the special class of binary input symmetric output (BISO) channels, Geng et al. showed that among channels with the same capacity, the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and binary erasure channel (BEC) are extremal with respect to the more capable order. Here we extend on this result by considering partial orders based on Renyi mutual information. We establish the extremality of the BSC and BEC in this setting with respect to the generalized Renyi capacity. In the process, we also generalize the needed tools and introduce $\alpha$-Lorenz curves.</description>

      <title>On the Outage Probability of Multiuser Multiple Antenna Systems with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Air-Ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores multiuser multiple antenna systems as a means to enhance the spectral efficiency of aeronautical communications systems. To this end, the outage regime for a multiuser multiple antenna system is studied within a realistic geometry-based stochastic air-ground (AG) channel model. In this application, users (aircraft) transmit air traffic management data to the ground station at a predefined target rate. Due to the nature of the AG propagation, we argue that the relevant performance metric in this context is the information outage probability. We consider the outage probability under three decoding approaches. The first is based on successive interference cancellation (SIC). The second extends the first approach by considering joint group decoding. The third is a version of the second that limits the size of the jointly decoded user groups in order to lower the decoding complexity. The results show that joint group decoding, even in groups of only two, can significantly increase the spectral efficiency in the AG channel by allowing a large number of aircraft to transmit over a non-orthogonal channel with very low outage probabilities.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Information, Variation, and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing body of empirical work suggests that the widespread adoption of generative AI produces a significant homogenizing effect on information, creativity, and cultural production. I first develop a novel theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon. I argue that a dynamic of AI-derivative epistemology, in which individuals increasingly defer to AI outputs, allows a centralized AI Prism to function, a technical mechanism whose architecture is designed to reduce variance and converge on the statistical mean. This provides a causal explanation for the generative monocultures observed in recent studies. However, I contend this represents only the first stage of a more complex and dialectical process. This paper's central and paradoxical thesis is that the very homogenization that flattens knowledge within specialized domains simultaneously renders that knowledge into consistent modules that can be recombined across them, a process foundational to innovation and creativity. However, this recombinant potential is not automatic, but rather conditional. This paper argues that these opposing forces, homogenizing defaults versus recombinant possibilities, are governed by the nature of human engagement with the technology. The ultimate effect of generative AI is conditional on whether individuals act as passive consumers deferring to the AI's statistical outputs, or as active curators who critically interrogate, re-contextualize, and recombine them. The paper concludes by outlining the cognitive and institutional scaffolds required to resolve this tension, arguing they are the decisive variable that determine whether generative AI becomes an instrument of innovation or homogenization.</description>

      <title>1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal acquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently constrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a trade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy consumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit depth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with low-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with Sigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However, SDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to handle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) addresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware, resulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a novel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and USF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise shaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited signals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains. (2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery method for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques, offering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a broader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Priestley Duality to suitable categories of fuzzy topological spaces and ordered algebraic structures that generalize bounded distributive lattices. The duality we prove extends not only classical Priestley Duality between Priestley Spaces and bounded distributive lattices, but also the duality between limit cut complete MV-algebras and Stone MV-topological spaces (proved by the second author in a previous paper) which, on its turn, is an extension of classical Stone Duality.</description>

      <title>AG codes from the Hermitian curve for Cross-Subspace Alignment in Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) addresses the problem of retrieving a desired message from distributed databases without revealing which message is being requested. Recent works have shown that cross-subspace alignment (CSA) codes constructed from algebraic geometry (AG) codes on high-genus curves can improve PIR rates over classical constructions. In this paper, we propose a new PIR scheme based on AG codes from the Hermitian curve, a well-known example of an $F_\ell$-maximal curve, that is, a curve defined over the finite field with $\ell$ elements which attains the Hasse-Weil upper bound on the number of its $F_\ell$-rational points. The large number of rational points enables longer code constructions, leading to higher retrieval rates than schemes based on genus 0, genus 1, and hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus. Our results highlight the potential of maximal curves as a natural source of efficient PIR constructions.</description>

Abstract: We show that suitably regular functions can be approximated in the $\mathcal{C}^1$-norm both with rational functions and rational neural networks, including approximation rates with respect to width and depth of the network, and degree of the rational functions. As consequence of our results, we further obtain $\mathcal{C}^1$-approximation results for rational neural networks with the $\text{EQL}^\div$ and ParFam architecture, both of which are important in particular in the context of symbolic regression for physical law learning.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Image Detection via Spectral Gaps of QC-RBIM Nishimori Bethe-Hessian Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advance of deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion networks now produces images that are virtually indistinguishable from genuine photographs, undermining media forensics and biometric security. Supervised detectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial post-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level statistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired, model-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a community-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are first extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature vector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities are transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature, producing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum exhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is present. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack such gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male versus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic counterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled synthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves over 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for real image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones. Our contributions are threefold: a novel LDPC graph construction that embeds deep image features, an analytical link between Nishimori temperature RBIM and the Bethe-Hessian spectrum providing a Bayes optimal detection criterion; and a practical, unsupervised synthetic image detector robust to new generative architectures. Future work will extend the framework to video streams and multi-class anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Global Permutation Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation Entropy, introduced by Bandt and Pompe, is a widely used complexity measure for real-valued time series that is based on the relative order of values within consecutive segments of fixed length. After standardizing each segment to a permutation and computing the frequency distribution of these permutations, Shannon Entropy is then applied to quantify the series' complexity. We introduce Global Permutation Entropy (GPE), a novel index that considers all possible patterns of a given length, including non-consecutive ones. Its computation relies on recently developed algorithms that enable the efficient extraction of full permutation profiles. We illustrate some properties of GPE and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic datasets, showing that it reveals structural information not accessible through standard permutation entropy. We provide a Julia package for the calculation of GPE at `https://github.com/AThreeH1/Global-Permutation-Entropy'.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Beam Squint Effect For Near-Field Wideband Communication Through Movable Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this correspondence, we study deploying movable antenna (MA) array in a wideband multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication system, where near-field (NF) channel model is considered. To alleviate beam squint effect, we propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire wideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly challenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the cutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop algorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of utilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.</description>

      <title>Statistical learning does not always entail knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study learning and knowledge acquisition (LKA) of an agent about a proposition that is either true or false. We use a Bayesian approach, where the agent receives data to update his beliefs about the proposition according to a posterior distribution. The LKA is formulated in terms of active information, with data representing external or exogenous information that modifies the agent's beliefs. It is assumed that data provide details about a number of features that are relevant to the proposition. We show that this leads to a Gibbs distribution posterior, which is in maximum entropy relative to the prior, conditioned on the side constraints that the data provide in terms of the features. We demonstrate that full learning is sometimes not possible and full knowledge acquisition is never possible when the number of extracted features is too small. We also distinguish between primary learning (receiving data about features of relevance for the proposition) and secondary learning (receiving data about the learning of another agent). We argue that this type of secondary learning does not represent true knowledge acquisition. Our results have implications for statistical learning algorithms, and we claim that such algorithms do not always generate true knowledge. The theory is illustrated with several examples.</description>
