      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics characterization of the free and encapsidated RNA2 of CCMV with the oxRNA model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) has emerged as an exemplary model system to assess the balance between electrostatic and topological features of ssRNA viruses, specifically in the context of the viral self-assembly process. Yet, in spite of its biophysical significance, little structural data of the RNA content of the CCMV virion is currently available. Here, the conformational dynamics of the RNA2 fragment of CCMV was assessed via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, employing the oxRNA2 model. The behavior of RNA2 has been characterized both as a freely-folding molecule and within a mean-field depiction of a CCMV-like capsid. For the latter, a multi-scale approach was employed, to derive a radial potential profile of the viral cavity, from atomistic structures of the CCMV capsid in solution. The conformational ensembles of the encapsidated RNA2 were significantly altered with respect to the freely-folding counterparts, as shown by the emergence of long-range motifs and pseudoknots in the former case. Finally, the role of the N-terminal tails of the CCMV subunits (and ionic shells thereof) is highlighted as a critical feature in the construction of a proper electrostatic model of the CCMV capsid.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of poking a cyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indentation tests are classical tools to determine material properties. For biological samples such as cysts of cells, however, the observed force-displacement relation cannot be expected to follow predictions for simple materials. Here, by solving the Pogorelov problem of a point force indenting an elastic shell for a purely nonlinear material, we discover that complex material behaviour can even give rise to new scaling exponents in this force-displacement relation. In finite-element simulations, we show that these exponents are surprisingly robust, persisting even for thick shells indented with a sphere. By scaling arguments, we generalise our results to pressurised and pre-stressed shells, uncovering additional new scaling exponents. We find these predicted scaling exponents in the force-displacement relation observed in cyst indentation experiments. Our results thus form the basis for inferring the mechanisms that set the mechanical properties of these biological materials.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Microscopy Based on the Inherent Fluctuations of Dye Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a critical tool across various disciplines, from materials science to biomedical research, yet it is limited by the diffraction limit of resolution. Advanced super-resolution techniques such as localization microscopy and stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy often demand considerable resources. These methods depend heavily on elaborate sample-staining, complex optical systems, or prolonged acquisition periods, and their application in 3D and multicolor imaging presents significant experimental challenges. In the current work, we provide a complete demonstration of a widely accessible super-resolution imaging approach capable of 3D and multicolor imaging. We replace the confocal pinhole with an array of single-photon avalanche diodes and use the microsecond-scale fluctuations of dye molecules as a contrast mechanism. This contrast is transformed into a super-resolved image using a robust and deterministic algorithm. Our technique utilizes natural fluctuations inherent to organic dyes, thereby it does not require engineering of the blinking statistics. Our robust, versatile super-resolution method opens the way to next-generation multimodal imaging and facilitates on-demand super-resolution within a confocal architecture.</description>

      <title>Population genetics: an introduction for physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population genetics lies at the heart of evolutionary theory. This topic forms part of many biological science curricula but is rarely taught to physics students. Since physicists are becoming increasingly interested in biological evolution, we aim to provide a brief introduction to population genetics, written for physicists. We start with two background chapters: chapter 1 provides a brief historical introduction to the topic, while chapter 2 provides some essential biological background. We begin our main content with chapter 3 which discusses the key concepts behind Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. Chapter 4 covers the basics of how variation is maintained in populations, while chapter 5 discusses mutation and selection. In chapter 6 we discuss stochastic effects in population genetics using the Wright-Fisher model as our example, and finally we offer concluding thoughts and references to excellent textbooks in chapter 7.</description>
