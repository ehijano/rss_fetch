      <title>Photonic lantern wavefront reconstruction in a multi-wavefront sensor single-conjugate adaptive optics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet direct imaging using adaptive optics (AO) is often limited by non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) and aberrations that are invisible to traditional pupil-plane wavefront sensors (WFSs). This can be remedied by focal-plane (FP) WFSs that characterize aberrations directly from a final science image. Photonic lanterns (PLs) can act as low-order FPWFSs with the ability to direct some light to downstream science instruments. Using a PL on the SEAL (Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory) high-contrast imaging testbed, we demonstrate (1) linear ranges and (2) closed-loop control. Additionally, we simulate the use of the PL in a multi-wavefront sensor AO system, in which multiple WFSs feed back to the same common-path deformable mirror. Building on previous multi-WFS AO demonstrations on SEAL, we simulate a modulated pyramid WFS to sense aberrations of high spatial order and large amplitude, and the PL to sense low order aberrations including NCPAs. We assess adaptive optics performance in this setting using three different PL wavefront reconstruction algorithms. We also provide a new method to experimentally identify the propagation matrix of a PL, making advanced model-based algorithms practical. This work demonstrates the role of photonic technologies and multi-stage wavefront sensing in the context of extreme AO and high contrast imaging.</description>

      <title>ExoSpikeNet: A Light Curve Analysis Based Spiking Neural Network for Exoplanet Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets are celestial bodies orbiting stars beyond our Solar System. Although historically they posed detection challenges, Kepler's data has revolutionized our understanding. By analyzing flux values from the Kepler Mission, we investigate the intricate patterns in starlight that may indicate the presence of exoplanets. This study investigates a novel approach for exoplanet classification using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) applied to data obtained from the NASA Kepler mission. SNNs offer a unique advantage by mimicking the spiking behavior of neurons in the brain, allowing for more nuanced and biologically inspired processing of temporal data. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SNN architecture, excelling in various performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.</description>

      <title>Development Status of Wideband Millimeter-Wave Receivers for LMT-FINER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the far-infrared [O III] and [C II] lines present a pathway to explore the mechanisms of the emergence of massive galaxies in the epoch of reionization and beyond, which is one of the most fundamental questions in astronomy. To address this question, the Far-Infrared Nebular Emission Receiver (FINER) project is developing two wideband dual-polarization sideband-separating heterodyne receivers at 120--210 GHz and 210--360 GHz for the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) in Mexico. Compared with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), LMT provides 40% of ALMA's light-collecting area and a similar atmospheric transmittance, but FINER plans to have an instantaneous intermediate frequency (IF) of 3--21 GHz per sideband per polarization which is five times wider than current ALMA's bandwidth. Therefore, FINER is going to offer cutting-edge spectral scanning capability in the next several years.
  The project is currently in an active development phase. In this proceeding, the latest development status for FINER, including the optics, wideband waveguide components as well as low-noise superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers is reported.</description>

      <title>FINER: Far-Infrared Nebular Emission Receiver for the Large Millimeter Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the emergence and prevalence of massive/bright galaxies during the epoch of reionization and beyond, within the first 600 million years of the Universe, stands as a pivotal pursuit in astronomy. Remarkable progress has been made by JWST in identifying an immense population of bright galaxies, which hints at exceptionally efficient galaxy assembly processes. However, the underlying physical mechanisms propelling their rapid growth remain unclear. With this in mind, millimeter and submillimeter-wave spectroscopic observations of redshifted far-infrared spectral lines, particularly the [O III] 88 micron and [C II] 158 micron lines, offers a crucial pathway to address this fundamental query.
  To this end, we develop a dual-polarization sideband-separating superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer receiver, FINER, for the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) situated in Mexico. Harnessing advancements from ALMA's wideband sensitivity upgrade (WSU) technology, FINER covers radio frequencies spanning 120-360 GHz, delivering an instantaneous intermediate frequency (IF) of 3-21 GHz per sideband per polarization, which is followed by a set of 10.24 GHz-wide digital spectrometers. At 40% of ALMA's light-collecting area, the LMT's similar atmospheric transmittance and FINER's 5 times wider bandwidth compared to ALMA culminate in an unparalleled spectral scanning capability in the northern hemisphere, paving the way for finer spectral-resolution detection of distant galaxies.</description>

      <title>A 10.24-GHz-wide digital spectrometer array system for LMT-FINER: system design and laboratory performance verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For efficient spectroscopic redshift identification of early galaxies in the northern hemisphere, we aim to combine the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) with a wide-band heterodyne receiver, FINER, which will cover radio frequencies of 120--360 GHz and offer a 3--21 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) per sideband and polarization. To take full advantage of such wide IFs, we present a novel 10.24-GHz-wide digital spectrometer, DRS4 (Elecs Industry Co., Ltd.). It incorporates 20.48 Gsps samplers with an FPGA-based digital signal processing module. To mitigate the noise contamination from the image sideband, it is equipped with a digital sideband separation function to improve the sideband rejection up to 25 dB. Laboratory performance evaluations show that it exhibits an Allan time of at least ~100 s and a total power dynamic range of at least 7 dB. These results demonstrate its capability of instantaneously wide-band spectroscopy toward high-redshift galaxies with position-switching observations.</description>

      <title>The Camera and Readout for the Trinity Demonstrator and the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a modular silicon photomultiplier camera to detect Earth-skimming PeV to EeV tau neutrinos with the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique. We built two cameras, a 256-pixel camera with S14161-6050HS SiPMs for the Trinity Demonstrator located on Frisco Peak, Utah, and a 512-pixel camera with S14521-6050AN SiPMs for the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope. The front-end electronics are based on the eMUSIC ASIC, and the camera signals are sampled and digitized with the 100MS/s and 12-bit AGET system. Both cameras are liquid-cooled. We detail the camera concept and the results from characterizing the SiPMs, bench testing, and calibrating the two cameras.</description>

      <title>HiFAST : An HI Data Calibration and Imaging Pipeline for FAST II. Flux Density Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate flux density calibration is essential for precise analysis and interpretation of observations across different observation modes and instruments. In this research, we firstly introduce the flux calibration model incorporated in HIFAST pipeline, designed for processing HI 21-cm spectra. Furthermore, we investigate different calibration techniques and assess the dependence of the gain parameter on the time and environmental factors. A comparison is carried out in various observation modes (e.g. tracking and scanning modes) to determine the flux density gain ($G$), revealing insignificant discrepancies in $G$ among different methods. Long-term monitoring data shows a linear correlation between $G$ and atmospheric temperature. After subtracting the $G$--Temperature dependence, the dispersion of $G$ is reduced to $&lt;$3% over a one-year time scale. The stability of the receiver response of FAST is considered sufficient to facilitate HI observations that can accommodate a moderate error in flux calibration (e.g., $&gt;\sim5\%$) when utilizing a constant $G$ for calibration purposes. Our study will serve as a useful addition to the results provided by Jiang et al. (2020). Detailed measurement of $G$ for the 19 beams of FAST, covering the frequency range 1000 MHz -- 1500 MHz can be found on the HIFAST homepage: https://hifast.readthedocs.io/fluxgain.</description>

      <title>NIRPS first light and early science: breaking the 1 m/s RV precision barrier at infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08304v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher or NIRPS is a precision radial velocity spectrograph developed through collaborative efforts among laboratories in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil, France, Portugal and Spain. NIRPS extends to the 0.98-1.8 $\mu$m domain of the pioneering HARPS instrument at the La Silla 3.6-m telescope in Chile and it has achieved unparalleled precision, measuring stellar radial velocities in the infrared with accuracy better than 1 m/s. NIRPS can be used either stand-alone or simultaneously with HARPS. Commissioned in late 2022 and early 2023, NIRPS embarked on a 5-year Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program in April 2023, spanning 720 observing nights. This program focuses on planetary systems around M dwarfs, encompassing both the immediate solar vicinity and transit follow-ups, alongside transit and emission spectroscopy observations. We highlight NIRPS's current performances and the insights gained during its deployment at the telescope. The lessons learned and successes achieved contribute to the ongoing advancement of precision radial velocity measurements and high spectral fidelity, further solidifying NIRPS' role in the forefront of the field of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{DiffLense}$: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Super-Resolution of Gravitational Lensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing data is frequently collected at low resolution due to instrumental limitations and observing conditions. Machine learning-based super-resolution techniques offer a method to enhance the resolution of these images, enabling more precise measurements of lensing effects and a better understanding of the matter distribution in the lensing system. This enhancement can significantly improve our knowledge of the distribution of mass within the lensing galaxy and its environment, as well as the properties of the background source being lensed. Traditional super-resolution techniques typically learn a mapping function from lower-resolution to higher-resolution samples. However, these methods are often constrained by their dependence on optimizing a fixed distance function, which can result in the loss of intricate details crucial for astrophysical analysis. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DiffLense}$, a novel super-resolution pipeline based on a conditional diffusion model specifically designed to enhance the resolution of gravitational lensing images obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Our approach adopts a generative model, leveraging the detailed structural information present in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) counterparts. The diffusion model, trained to generate HST data, is conditioned on HSC data pre-processed with denoising techniques and thresholding to significantly reduce noise and background interference. This process leads to a more distinct and less overlapping conditional distribution during the model's training phase. We demonstrate that $\texttt{DiffLense}$ outperforms existing state-of-the-art single-image super-resolution techniques, particularly in retaining the fine details necessary for astrophysical analyses.</description>

      <title>Detection of Moving Objects in Earth Observation Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving objects have characteristic signatures in multi-spectral images made by Earth observation satellites that use push broom scanning. While the general concept is applicable to all satellites of this type, each satellite design has its own unique imaging system and requires unique methods to analyze the characteristic signatures. We assess the feasibility of detecting moving objects and measuring their velocities in one particular archive of satellite images made by Planet Labs Corporation with their constellation of SuperDove satellites. Planet Labs data presents a particular challenge in that the images in the archive are mosaics of individual exposures and therefore do not have unique time stamps. We explain how the timing information can be restored indirectly. Our results indicate that the movement of common transportation vehicles, airplanes, cars, and boats, can be detected and measured.</description>

      <title>Influence of Orbit and Mass Constraints on Reflected Light Characterization of Directly Imaged Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survey strategies for upcoming exoplanet direct imaging missions have considered varying assumptions of prior knowledge. Precursor radial velocity surveys could have detected nearby exo-Earths and provided prior orbit and mass constraints. Alternatively, a direct imaging mission performing astrometry could yield constraints on orbit and phase angle of target planets. Understanding the impact of prior mass and orbit information on planetary characterization is crucial for efficiently recognizing habitable exoplanets. To address this question, we use a reflected-light retrieval tool to infer the atmospheric and bulk properties of directly imaged Earth-analogs while considering varying levels of prior information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Because of the strong correlation between the orbit-related parameters and the planetary radius, prior information on the orbital distance and planetary phase yield tight constraints on the planetary radius: from $R_{\rm{p}}=2.95^{+2.69}_{-1.95}~R_{\oplus}$ without prior knowledge, to $R_{\rm{p}}=1.01^{+0.33}_{-0.19}~R_{\oplus}$ with prior determination of the orbit for $\rm{SNR}=20$ in the visible/near-infrared spectral range, thus allowing size determination from reflected light observations. However, additional knowledge of planet mass does not notably enhance radius ($R_{\rm{p}}=0.98^{+0.17}_{-0.14}~R_{\oplus}$) or atmospheric characterization. Also, prior knowledge of the mass alone does not yield a tight radius constraint ($R_{\rm{p}}=1.64^{+1.29}_{-0.80}~R_{\oplus}$) nor improves atmospheric composition inference. By contrast, because of its sensitivity to gas column abundance, detecting a Rayleigh scattering slope or bounding Rayleigh opacity helps to refine gas mixing ratio inferences without requiring prior mass knowledge. Overall, apart from radius determination, increasing the SNR is more beneficial than additional prior observations.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the diversity of modeling methods to probe systematic biases in strong lensing analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, the diversity of strong lens modeling methods has exploded, from being purely analytical to pixelated and non-parametric, or based on deep learning. We embrace this diversity by selecting different software packages and use them to blindly model independently simulated Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. To overcome the difficulties arising from using different codes and conventions, we use the COde-independent Organized LEns STandard (COOLEST) to store, compare and release all models in a self-consistent and human-readable manner. From an ensemble of six modeling methods, we study the recovery of the lens potential parameters and properties of the reconstructed source. In particular, we simulate and infer parameters of an elliptical power-law mass distribution with external shear for the lens while each modeling method reconstructs the source differently. We find that overall, both lens and source properties are recovered reasonably well, but systematic biases arise in all methods. Interestingly, we do not observe that a single method is significantly more accurate than others, and the amount of bias largely depends on the specific lens or source property of interest. By combining posterior distributions from individual methods using equal weights, the maximal systematic biases on lens model parameters inferred from individual models are reduced by a factor of 5.4 on average. We investigate a selection of modeling effects that partly explain the observed biases, such as the cuspy nature of the background source and the accuracy of the point spread function. This work introduces, for the first time, a generic framework to compare and ease the combination of models obtained from different codes and methods, which will be key to retain accuracy in future strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Detection of gravitational waves in circular particle accelerators II. Response analysis and parameter estimation using synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the response of a Storage Ring Gravitational-Wave Observatory (SRGO) to astrophysical millihertz (mHz) gravitational waves (GWs), numerically obtaining its sensitivity curve and optimal choices for some controllable experiment parameters. We also generate synthetic noisy GW data and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to perform parameter estimation of the source properties and their degeneracies. We show that a single SRGO could potentially localize the GW source in the sky using Earth's rotation. We also study the source sky localization area, mass and distance estimation errors as functions of noise, data sampling rate, and observing time. Finally, we discuss, along with its implications, the capacity of an SRGO to detect and constrain the parameters of millihertz GW events.</description>

      <title>APPLE: An Evolution Code for Modeling Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably-stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.</description>
