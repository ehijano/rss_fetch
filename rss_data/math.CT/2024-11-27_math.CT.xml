      <title>The cohomology objects of a semi-abelian variety are small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known, but often ignored issue in Yoneda-style definitions of cohomology objects via collections of $n$-step extensions (i.e., equivalence classes of exact sequences of a given length $n$ between two given objects, usually subject to further criteria, and equipped with some algebraic structure) is, whether such a collection of extensions forms a set. We explain that in the context of a semi-abelian variety of algebras, the answer to this question is, essentially, yes: for the collection of all $n$-step extensions between any two objects, a set of representing extensions can be chosen, so that the collection of extensions is "small" in the sense that a bijection to a set exists.
  We further consider some variations on this result, involving double extensions and crossed extensions (in the context of a semi-abelian variety), and Schreier extensions (in the category of monoids).</description>

      <title>Categorical Ambidexterity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an ambidexterity result for $\infty$-categories of $\infty$-categories admitting a collection of colimits. This unifies and extends two known phenomena: the identification of limits and colimits of presentable $\infty$-categories indexed by a space, and the $\infty$-semiadditivity of the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories with $\pi$-finite colimits proven by Harpaz. Our proof employs Stefanich's universal property for the higher category of iterated spans, which encodes ambidexterity phenomena in a coherent fashion.</description>

      <title>Global Weyl modules for thin Lie algebras are finite-dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of Weyl modules, both local and global, goes back to Chari and Pressley in the case of affine Lie algebras, and has been extensively studied for various Lie algebras graded by root systems. We extend that definition to a certain class of Lie algebras graded by weight lattices and prove that if such a Lie algebra satisfies a natural "thinness" condition, then already the global Weyl modules are finite-dimensional. Our motivating example of a thin Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane vanishing at the origin. We also introduce stratifications of categories of modules over such Lie algebras and identify the corresponding strata categories.</description>

      <title>Dynamic task delegation for hierarchical agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the fourth installment in a series of papers offering models of hierarchical structure for dynamical systems, using the language of polynomial functors. The operad underlying the symmetric monoidal category $(\mathbf{Poly}, \otimes, \mathcal{y})$ can be viewed as defining the behavior of hierarchical delegation. In particular, a morphism $\mathbf{Poly}(p_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes p_m, q)$ turns the outputs of subordinates with interfaces $p_i$ into the output of an agent with interface $q$ and turns a task given to the agent into a task for each of the subordinates. In this article, we extend the framework so that subordinates may be invoked asynchronously depending on the outcomes of other subordinates. We prove that the free (co)monad (co)monad extends to a (co)monad on $\mathbf{Org}$. From the perspective of programs/pattern, this extension implies the existence of a $\mathbf{Cat}$-enriched operad $\mathbf{Org}_\mathfrak{m}$, and from the perspective of behavior/matter, it implies the existence of a $\mathbf{Cat}$-enriched operad $\mathbf{Org}^\mathfrak{c}$. Second, we crispen the relationship between the programmatic and behavioral perspectives via a functor $[-, t] \colon \mathbf{Org}_{\mathfrak{m}}^\textrm{op} \to \mathbf{Org}^\mathfrak{c}$ for any polynomial monad $t$.</description>

      <title>Correspondences between codensity and coupling-based liftings, a practical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kantorovich distance is a widely used metric between probability distributions. The Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality states that it can be defined in two equivalent ways: as a supremum, based on non-expansive functions into [0, 1], and as an infimum, based on probabilistic couplings.Orthogonally, there are categorical generalisations of both presentations proposed in the literature, in the form of codensity liftings and what we refer to as coupling-based liftings. Both lift endofunctors on the category Set of sets and functions to that of pseudometric spaces, and both are parameterised by modalities from coalgebraic modal logic.A generalisation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality has been more nebulous-it is known not to work in some cases. In this paper we propose a compositional approach for obtaining such generalised dualities for a class of functors, which is closed under coproducts and products. Our approach is based on an explicit construction of modalities and also applies to and extends known cases such as that of the powerset functor.</description>

      <title>The Tangle Hypothesis: Dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an $(\infty,1)$-category ${\sf Bord}_1^{\sf fr}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the morphisms in which are framed tangles in $\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{D}^1$. We prove that ${\sf Bord}_1^{\sf fr}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ has the universal mapping out property of the 1-dimensional Tangle Hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Hopkins--Lurie: it is the rigid $\mathcal{E}_n$-monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category freely generated by a single object. Applying this theorem to a dualizable object of a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category gives link invariants, generalizing the Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants.</description>
