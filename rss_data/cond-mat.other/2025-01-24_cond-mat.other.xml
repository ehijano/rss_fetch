      <title>Algebraic skin effect in two-dimensional non-Hermitian metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials have unlocked unprecedented control over light by leveraging novel mechanisms to expand their functionality. Non-Hermitian physics further enhances the tunability of non-Hermitian metamaterials (NHMs) through phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), enabling applications like directional amplification. The higher-dimensional NHSE manifests unique effects, including the algebraic skin effect (ASE), which features power-law decay instead of exponential localization, allowing for quasi-long-range interactions. In this work, we establish apparent criteria for achieving ASE in two-dimensional reciprocal NHMs with anisotropic and complex dielectric tensors. By numerically and theoretically demonstrating ASE through mismatched optical axes and geometric structures, we reveal that ASE is governed by a generalized Fermi surface whose dimensionality exceeds that of the Fermi surface. We further propose and validate a realistic photonic crystal design for ASE, which is experimentally accessible. Our recipe for ASE provides a versatile pathway for broader generalizations, including three-dimensional structures, synthetic dimensions, and other classical wave systems, paving the way for advancements in non-Hermitian photonics.</description>

      <title>Krylov Subspace Methods for Quantum Dynamics with Time-Dependent Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods in quantum dynamics identify the minimal subspace in which a process unfolds. To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions governed by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid for driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps the evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and time dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of fundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We also discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time evolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A multi-detector neutral helium atom microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) is an emerging technique that uses a beam of neutral atoms to image and analyse surfaces. The low energies ($\sim$64 meV) and completely non-destructive nature of the probe particles provide exceptional sensitivity for studying delicate samples and thin devices, including 2D materials. To date, around five such instruments have been constructed and are described in the literature. All represent the first attempts at SHeM construction in different laboratories, and use a single detection device. Here, we describe our second generation microscope, which is the first to offer multi-detector capabilities. The new instrument builds on recent research into SHeM optimisation and incorporates many improved design features over our previous instrument. We present measurements that highlight some of the unique capabilities the instrument provides, including 3D surface profiling, alternative imaging modes, and simultaneous acquisition of images from a mixed species beam.</description>
