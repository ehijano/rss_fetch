Abstract: High proved the following theorem. If the intersections of any two congruent copies of a plane convex body are centrally symmetric, then this body is a circle. In our paper we extend the theorem of High to the sphere and the hyperbolic plane, and partly to spaces of constant curvature. We also investigate the dual question about the convex hull of the unions, rather than the intersections.
  Let us have in $H^2$ proper closed convex subsets $K,L$ with interior points, such that the numbers of the connected components of the boundaries of $K$ and $L$ are finite. We exactly describe all pairs of such subsets $K,L$, whose any congruent copies have an intersection with axial symmetry; there are nine cases. (The cases of $S^2$ and ${\Bbb{R}}^2$ were described in Part I, i.e., \cite{5}.)
  Let us have in $S^d$, ${\Bbb{R}}^d$ or $H^d$ proper closed convex $C^2_+$ subsets $K,L$ with interior points, such that all sufficiently small intersections of their congruent copies are symmetric w.r.t.\ a particular hyperplane. Then the boundary components of both $K$ and $L$ are congruent, and each of them is a sphere, a parasphere or a hypersphere.
  Let us have a pair of convex bodies in $S^d$, ${\Bbb{R}}^d$ or $H^d$, which have at any boundary points supporting spheres (for $S^d$ of radius less than $\pi /2$). If the convex hull of the union of any congruent copies of these bodies is centrally symmetric, then our bodies are congruent balls (for $S^d$ of radius less than $\pi /2$). An analogous statement holds for symmetry w.r.t.\ a particular hyperplane. For $d=2$, suppose the existence of the above supporting circles (for $S^2$ of radius less than $\pi /2$), and, for $S^2$, smoothness of $K$ and $L$. If we suppose axial symmetry of all the above convex hulls, then our bodies are (incongruent) circles (for $S^2$ of radii less than $\pi /2$).</description>

      <title>Concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems under Karamata regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Karamata regular operators, which is a notion of regularity that is suitable for obtaining concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems. This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes beyond, H\"olderian error bounds and H\"older regular operators. By concrete, we mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a function of the iteration number $k$ instead, of say, a function of the iterate $x^k$. While it is well-known that under H\"olderian-like assumptions many algorithms converge linearly/sublinearly (depending on the exponent), little it is known when the underlying problem data does not satisfy H\"olderian assumptions, which may happen if a problem involves exponentials and logarithms. Our main innovation is the usage of the theory of regularly varying functions which we showcase by obtaining concrete convergence rates for quasi-cylic algorithms in non-H\"olderian settings. This includes certain rates that are neither sublinear nor linear but sit somewhere in-between, including a case where the rate is expressed via the Lambert W function. Finally, we connect our discussion to o-minimal geometry and show that definable operators in any o-minimal structure are always Karamata regular.</description>

      <title>Quantitative upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces measures how far the spaces are from being isometric. It has played an important and longstanding role in geometry and shape comparison. More recently, it has been discovered that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between unit spheres equipped with the geodesic metric has important connections to Borsuk-Ulam theorems and Vietoris-Rips complexes.
  We develop a discrete framework for obtaining upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres, and provide the first quantitative bounds that apply to spheres of all possible pairs of dimensions. As a special case, we determine the exact Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the circle and any higher-dimensional sphere, and determine the asymptotic behavior of the distance from the 2-sphere to the $k$-sphere up to constants.</description>

      <title>Uniformly rectifiable metric spaces satisfy the weak constant density condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak constant density condition is a quantitative regularity property originally investigated by David and Semmes in their foundational work on uniform rectifiability. Roughly speaking, a space satisfies this condition if in \textit{most} balls, the space supports a measure with \textit{nearly constant} density in a neighborhood of scales and locations. In this paper, we prove that uniformly rectifiable metric spaces satisfy the weak constant density condition, an extension of a theorem of David and Semmes. In order to do this, we first prove a strengthened version of a separate theorem of David and Semmes which weakly controls the oscillation of the means of $L^\infty$ functions over normed balls.</description>

      <title>Weakly porous sets and Muckenhoupt $A_p$ distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the class of weakly porous sets in Euclidean spaces. As our first main result we show that the distance weight $w(x)=\operatorname{dist}(x,E)^{-\alpha}$ belongs to the Muckenhoupt class $A_1$, for some $\alpha&gt;0$, if and only if $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is weakly porous. We also give a precise quantitative version of this characterization in terms of the so-called Muckenhoupt exponent of $E$. When $E$ is weakly porous, we obtain a similar quantitative characterization of $w\in A_p$, for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, as well. At the end of the paper, we give an example of a set $E\subset\mathbb{R}$ which is not weakly porous but for which $w\in A_p\setminus A_1$ for every $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>
