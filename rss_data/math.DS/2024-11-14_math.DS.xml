      <title>On Regular H\'enon-like Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a renormalization theory of non-perturbative dissipative H\'enon-like maps with combinatorics of bounded type. The main novelty of our approach is the incorporation of Pesin theoretic ideas to the renormalization method, which enables us to control the small-scale geometry of dynamics in the higher-dimensional setting. In a prequel to this paper, it is shown that, under certain regularity conditions on the return maps, renormalizations of H\'enon-like maps have $\textit{a priori}$ bounds. The current paper is devoted to the applications of this critical estimate. First, we prove that H\'enon-like maps converge under renormalization to the same renormalization attractor as for 1D unimodal maps. Second, we show that the necessary and sufficient conditions for renormalization convergence are finite-time checkable. Lastly, we show that every infinitely renormalizable H\'enon-like map is $\textit{regularly unicritical}$: there exists a unique orbit of tangencies between strong-stable and center manifolds, and outside a slow-exponentially shrinking neighborhood of this orbit, the dynamics behaves as a uniformly partially hyperbolic system.</description>

      <title>Essential dynamics in chaotic attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a smooth vector field $F$ of $S^3$ generates a sufficiently complicated heteroclinic knot, the flow also generates infinitely many periodic orbits, which persist under smooth perturbations which preserve the heteroclinic knot. Consequentially, we then associate a Template with the flow dynamics - regardless of whether $F$ satisfies any hyperbolicity condition or not. In addition, inspired by the Thurston-Nielsen Classification Theorem, we also conclude topological criteria for the existence of chaotic dynamics for three-dimensional flows - which we apply to study both the R\"ossler and Lorenz attractors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the construction of a non-affine hypersurface on an $n$-simplex in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Additionally, fractal dimension of the graph of a non-affine multivariate real-valued fractal function is estimated under certain conditions. Furthermore, the upper bound of the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant probability measure supported on the graph of such fractal function is estimated.</description>

      <title>David regularity of the Yoccoz extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a central problem in the study of critical circle dynamics to understand the regularity of Yoccoz conjugators: the circle homeomorphisms that conjugate critical circle maps of irrational rotation numbers with their corresponding rigid rotations. One can shift the perspective on this problem and look at the regularity of extensions of such maps to the unit disk. Of particular interest to us, one can ask when this conjugator has David extensions. Following a conjecture of Petersen and Zakeri, we classify the David regularity of one extension process, the Yoccoz extension, and discuss its optimality.</description>

      <title>Continuity of matings of Kleinian groups and polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the study of holomorphic correspondences as dynamical systems that can display behaviors of both rational maps and Kleinian groups has gained a good amount of attention. This phenomenon is related to the Sullivan dictionary, a list of parallels between the theories of these two systems. We build upon a surgical construction of such matings, due to Bullett and Harvey, increasing the degree of maps we consider, and proving regularity properties of the mating map on parameter spaces: namely, analyticity on the interior of its domain of definition, and continuity under quasiconformal rigidity on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of breathers for coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral stability of non-degenerate vector soliton solutions and the nonlinear stability of breather solutions for the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger (CNLS) equations. The non-degenerate vector solitons are spectrally stable despite the linearized operator admits either embedded or isolated eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. The nonlinear stability of breathers is obtained by the Lyapunov method with the help of the squared eigenfunctions due to integrability of the CNLS equations.</description>

      <title>Fully chaotic conservative models for some torus homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homotopic-to-the-identity torus homeomorphisms, whose rotation set has nonempty interior. We prove that any such map is monotonically semiconjugate to a homeomorphism that preserves the Lebesgue measure, and that has the same rotation set. Furthermore, the dynamics of the quotient map has several interesting chaotic traits: for instance, it is topologically mixing, has a dense set of periodic points and is continuum-wise expansive. In particular, this shows that a convex compact set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with nonempty interior is the rotation set of the lift of a homeomorphism of $\mathbb{T}^2$ if and only if it is the rotation set of the lift of a conservative homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>A curious dynamical system in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any irrational $\alpha &gt; 0$ and any initial value $z_{-1} \in \mathbb{C}$, we define a sequence of complex numbers $(z_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ as follows: $z_n$ is $z_{n-1} + e^{2 \pi i \alpha n}$ or $z_{n-1} - e^{2 \pi i \alpha n}$, whichever has the smaller absolute value. If both numbers have the same absolute value, the sequence terminates at $z_{n-1}$ but this happens rarely. This dynamical system has astonishingly intricate behavior: the choice of signs in $z_{n-1} \pm e^{2 \pi i \alpha n}$ appears to eventually become periodic (though the period can be large). We prove that if one observes periodic signs for a sufficiently long time (depending on $z_{-1}, \alpha$), the signs remain periodic for all time. The surprising complexity of the system is illustrated through examples.</description>

      <title>Absolute concentration robustness: Algebra and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of how biological systems maintain homeostasis in changing environments, Shinar and Feinberg introduced in 2010 the concept of absolute concentration robustness (ACR). A biochemical system exhibits ACR in some species if the steady-state value of that species does not depend on initial conditions. Thus, a system with ACR can maintain a constant level of one species even as the environment changes. Despite a great deal of interest in ACR in recent years, the following basic question remains open: How can we determine quickly whether a given biochemical system has ACR? Although various approaches to this problem have been proposed, we show that they are incomplete. Accordingly, we present new methods for deciding ACR, which harness computational algebra. We illustrate our results on several biochemical signaling networks.</description>

      <title>Borel graphable equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of analytic equivalence relations which are Borel graphable, i.e. which can be realized as the connectedness relation of a Borel graph. Our main focus is the question of which analytic equivalence relations are Borel graphable. First, we study an equivalence relation arising from the theory of countable admissible ordinals and show that it is Borel graphable if and only if there is a non-constructible real. As a corollary of the proof, we construct an analytic equivalence relation which is (provably in ZFC) not Borel graphable and an effectively analytic equivalence relation which is Borel graphable but not effectively Borel graphable. Next, we study analytic equivalence relations given by the isomorphism relation for some class of countable structures. We show that all such equivalence relations are Borel graphable, which implies that for every Borel action of $S_\infty$, the associated orbit equivalence relation is Borel graphable. This leads us to study the class of Polish groups whose Borel actions always give rise to Borel graphable orbit equivalence relations; we refer to such groups as graphic groups. We show that besides $S_\infty$, the class of graphic groups includes all connected Polish groups and is closed under countable products. We finish by studying structural properties of the class of Borel graphable analytic equivalence relations and by considering two variations on Borel graphability: a generalization with hypegraphs instead of graphs and an analogue of Borel graphability in the setting of computably enumerable equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Infection Pressure on Fish in Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of how to connect predictions by hydrodynamic models of how sea lice move in water to observable measures that count the number of lice on each fish in a cage in the water. This question is important for management and regulation of aquacultural practice that tries to maximise food production and minimise risk to the environment. We do this through a simple rule-based model of interaction between sea lice and caged fish. The model is simple: sea lice can attach and detach from a fish. The model has a novel feature, encoding what is known as a master equation producing a time-series of distributions of lice on fish that one might expect to find if a cage full of fish were placed at any given location. To demonstrate how this works, and to arrive at a rough estimate of the interaction rates, we fit a simplified version of the model with three free parameters to publicly available data about an experiment with sentinel cages in Loch Linnhe in Scotland. Our construction, coupled to the hydrodynamic models driven by surveillance data from industrial farms, quantifies the environmental impact as: what would the infection burden look like in a notional cage at any location and how does it change with time?</description>
