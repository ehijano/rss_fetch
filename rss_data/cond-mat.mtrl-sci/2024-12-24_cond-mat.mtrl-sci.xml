      <title>Machine-learnt potential highlights melting and freezing of aluminium nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the complete thermodynamic cycle of aluminium nanoparticles through classical molecular dynamics simulations, spanning a wide size range from 200 atoms to 11000 atoms. The aluminium-aluminium interactions are modelled using a newly developed Bayesian Force Field (BFF) from the FLARE suite, a cutting-edge tool in our field. We discuss the database requirements to include melted nanodroplets to avoid unphysical behaviour at the phase transition. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural stability up to sizes as large as $3~ 10^5$ atoms. The developed Al-BFF predicts an icosahedral stability range of up to 2000 atoms, approximately 2 nm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25000 atoms. Beyond this size, the expected structure favours face-centred cubic (FCC) shapes. At a fixed heating/cooling rate of 100K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis loop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with solidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes icosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms. Using a hierarchical k-means clustering, we find no evidence of surface melting but observe some mild indication of surface freezing. In any event, the liquid droplet's surface shows local structural order at all sizes.</description>

      <title>Atomic resolution imaging of 3D crystallography in functional oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst atomic resolution imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has revolutionized science and technology, it cannot see things happening out of the plane of the image and merely forms projection images. In this article we show that it is possible to directly map the direction and magnitude of atom displacements at 30{\deg} to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6 thin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-(Sr,Ta)AlO3) using a 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4DSTEM) methodology. The interpretation is backed up by analysis of theoretical simulations. We reveal that the b-axis always lies in the plane of interface in every area we looked at, and that the atom modulation is strongly suppressed close to the epitaxial interface. This crystallographic detail was not previously revealed or visible by conventional STEM imaging and the new methodology sheds a lot more light on why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double perovskite cation ordering and consequently the best achieved magnetic ordering in this thin film system. This approach of fitting atomic resolution 4DSTEM data to determine crystal parameters opens the door for a new era of atomic-resolution crystallography.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</description>

      <title>Structural and electronic properties of bulk Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$: first-principles simulations based on numerical atomic orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of advanced materials with high specific energy is crucial for enabling sustainable energy storage solutions, particularly in applications such as lithium-air batteries. Lithium peroxide (Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$) is a key discharge product in non-aqueous lithium-air systems, where its structural and electronic properties significantly influence battery performance. In this work, we investigate the atomic structure, electronic band structure, and Wannier functions of bulk Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$ using density functional theory. The performance of different basis sets of numerical atomic orbitals are compared with respect to a converged plane-wave basis results. We analyze the material's ionic characteristics, the formation of molecular orbitals in oxygen dimers, and the band gap discrepancies between various computational approaches. Furthermore, we develop a localized Wannier basis to model electron-vibration interactions and explore their implications for polaron formation. Our findings provide a chemically intuitive framework for understanding electron-lattice coupling and offer a basis for constructing reduced models that accurately describe the dynamics of polarons in Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$. These insights contribute to the broader goal of improving energy storage technologies and advancing the field of materials design.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Liquid $T^2$ Resistivity: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Meets Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent Enhancement due to Spin-Exchange Carrier Multiplication in Films of Manganese-Doped 'Inverted' CdSe/HgSe Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporation of manganese impurities into II-VI semiconductors results in a dramatic change in their properties due to strong exchange interactions between the Mn ion and the semiconductor host. In colloidal quantum dots (QDs), these interactions result in a rapid bidirectional energy transfer between the magnetic impurity and the QD intrinsic states, which is characterized by an extremely high energy transfer rate of more than ~5 eV/ps. This rate is higher than the rate of energy loss due to phonon emission (typically, ~1 eV/ps or less), so Mn-QD interactions could in principle be used to capture and utilize the kinetic energy of the hot carrier before it is lost to phonons. Here, we demonstrate that by using Mn-doped CdSe/HgSe core/shell QDs, we can efficiently convert the kinetic energy of a hot exciton into an additional electron-hole pair (exciton). This carrier multiplication process occurs through rapid capture of a hot exciton by a Mn ion, which then undergoes spin flip relaxation, producing two excitons near the QD band edge. Due to the inverted geometry of the CdSe/HgSe QDs, both electrons and holes resulting from carrier multiplication occupy the QD shell, allowing them to be easily extracted from the QD for potential use in electro-optical devices or chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Polarization and driving force analysis of coherent optical shear phonons in graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent optical phonons in the degenerate inter-layer shear mode of graphite launched by femtosecond laser pulses were investigated using ultrafast electron diffraction. The collective atomic motion is shown to be polarized in a direction related to the linear polarization of the incoming laser pulse. Using a driven-oscillator model, the lifetime of the oscillator's driving force is determined to 37(30) fs. This is much shorter than the lifetime of excited carriers in graphite but similar to the time scale of the loss of the hot carrier's k-space anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Noncollinear Magnetic Energy Landscapes with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of magnetic energy landscapes and the search for ground states of magnetic materials using ab initio methods like density functional theory (DFT) is a challenging task. Complex interactions, such as superexchange and spin-orbit coupling, make these calculations computationally expensive and often lead to non-trivial energy landscapes. Consequently, a comprehensive and systematic investigation of large magnetic configuration spaces is often impractical. We approach this problem by utilizing Bayesian Optimization, an active machine learning scheme that has proven to be efficient in modeling unknown functions and finding global minima. Using this approach we can obtain the magnetic contribution to the energy as a function of one or more spin canting angles with relatively small numbers of DFT calculations. To assess the capabilities and the efficiency of the approach we investigate the noncollinear magnetic energy landscapes of selected materials containing 3d, 5d and 5f magnetic ions: Ba$_3$MnNb$_2$O$_9$, LaMn$_2$Si$_2$, $\beta$-MnO$_2$, Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, UO$_2$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$. By comparing our results to previous ab initio studies that followed more conventional approaches, we observe significant improvements in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Excitonic effects on infrared vibrational and Raman spectroscopy from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles approach to compute infrared (IR) vibrational absorption and Raman scattering spectra with excitonic effects included. Our method is based on a perturbative expansion of electron-phonon and electron-light couplings in the time-dependent adiabatic GW (TD-aGW) theory. We show that excitonic effects in the IR absorption spectrum can be included by replacing the free electron-hole propagators in the perturbative expression for independent particles with their interacting counterparts, which are readily available from standard GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations. For Raman spectrum, our derived expression agrees with the single and double resonance terms from a diagrammatic approach. We show significant excitonic enhancement in both the IR and resonance Raman scattering intensity for monolayer MoS2, WS2, and WSe2. Moreover, the exciton-phonon coupling strength and exciton energy landscape can be accessed by analyzing resonance Raman spectrum of these materials.</description>

      <title>Analytic model for grain-boundary segregation ener-gies in metal polycrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) of polycrystals strongly impacts the mechanical properties of metals including strength, fracture, embrittlement, and corrosion. However, the complexity of GB structures and the large chemical space of solutes and matrices impede the understanding of segregation. Herein, we identify a physical-based determinant, by unifying the effects of plastic strain and bonding breaking, for determining the segregation energies at GBs. By further combining with the usual coordination number, atomic radius of solutes and matrices, and cohesive energy of matrices, we build an analytic framework to predict segregation energies of polycrystal GBs across various solutes and matrices. These findings indicate an unusual Coulombic-like and localized nature of the bonding at polycrystal GBs and bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Our scheme not only uncovers the coupling rule of solutes and matrices for GB segregation in polycrystals, but also provides an effective tool for the design of high-performance alloys.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials are Ready for Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been an ongoing race for the past couple of years to develop the best universal machine learning interatomic potential. This rapid growth has driven researchers to create increasingly accurate models for predicting energy, forces, and stresses, combining innovative architectures with big data. Here, these models are benchmarked for their performance in predicting phonon properties, which are critical for understanding the vibrational and thermal behavior of materials. Our analysis is based on around 10 000 ab initio phonon calculations, enabling us to assess performance across a range of phonon-related parameters while testing the universal applicability of these models. The results reveal that some models are already capable of predicting phonon properties with a high level of accuracy. However, others still exhibit substantial inaccuracies, even if they excel in the prediction of the energy and the forces for materials close to dynamical equilibrium. These findings highlight the importance of considering phonon-related properties in the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Resonant Raman Scattering and Optical Absorption Studies of Zn(II) Impurities in L-Alanine Single Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of low-concentration Zn (II) impurities in L-Alanine Single Crystal (ZNLA) employing resonant Raman scattering and optical absorption spectroscopy. By analyzing the relative integrated intensity of the selective vibrational modes, we observe a resonant enhancement of Raman-active modes near the UV absorption band, associated with vibrations of the amino and carboxyl groups in ZNLA. These findings suggest that zinc cations occupy an interstitial position coordinated by amino and carboxyl groups. Also, ZNLA single crystal shows a strong antiresonance behavior for some modes associated with amino and carboxyl groups. The antiresonance model in the cross-section allowed the estimation of the bandgap to be 3.8 eV, which perfectly agrees with the direct bandgap obtained from the absorption spectrum (3.75 eV). Finally, our approach proves to be useful for detecting interactions between transition metal ion impurities and intramolecular structures in other transition metal-doped organic amino acid systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional nucleation and growth of deformation twins in magnesium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At two-thirds the weight of aluminum, magnesium alloys have the potential to significantly reduce the fuel consumption of transportation vehicles. These advancements depend on our ability to optimize the desirable versus undesirable effects of deformation twins: three dimensional (3D) microstructural domains that form under mechanical stresses. Previously only characterized using surface or thin-film measurements, here, we present the first 3D in-situ characterization of deformation twinning inside an embedded grain over mesoscopic fields of view using dark-field X-ray microscopy supported by crystal plasticity finite element analysis. The results reveal the important role of triple junctions on twin nucleation, that twin growth behavior is irregular and can occur in several directions simultaneously, and that twin-grain and twin-twin junctions are the sites of localized dislocation accumulation, a necessary precursor to crack initiation.</description>

      <title>The role of primary and secondary electrons in scanning transmission electron microscopy of hybrid perovskites: the CsPbBr$_{3}$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging has revolutionized materials science by offering detailed insights into the atomic structures of materials. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy rely on analysing backscattered and transmitted electrons as well as stimulated radiation emission to form structural and chemical maps. These signals contain information about the elastic and inelastic electron-scattering processes within the sample, including collective and single electron excitations such as plasmons, inter- and intraband transitions. In this study, ab initio and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the behaviour of high-energy primary and secondary electrons in scanning transmission experiments on CsPbBr$_3$ nanosamples. CsPbBr$_3$ is a perovskite material known for its high photoluminescence quantum yield, making it promising for applications in light-emitting devices and solar cells. This study explores and estimates the reflection and transmission of primary and secondary electrons based on their kinetic energy as well as sample thickness and work function. The spatial distribution and energy spectra of the secondary electrons are also examined and calculated to understand their generation depth and energy dynamics. These findings establish a theoretical framework for studying electron-material interactions and can aid in optimizing scanning microscopy techniques for imaging and characterizing advanced materials.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure of Nd10.67Pt4O24, a new neodymium platinate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new platinate was recently discovered when Nd2O3 was explored as a platinum capture material in the Ostwald process, formed by a direct reaction between PtO2(g) and Nd2O3. The crystal structure of this new platinate and its composition, Nd10.67Pt4O24 , are here reported for the first time. The compound is synthesized either by a direct reaction using PtO2(g) or by the citric acid chemical route. Based on 3-dimensional electron diffraction data and Rietveld refinement of high-resolution synchrotron and neutron powder diffraction data, we accurately describe its crystal structure in space group I41/a. The compound is structurally related to the Ln11-xSrxIr4O24 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm) phases with a double-perovskite (A2BB'O6) like crystal structure and A-site cation-deficiency. Owing to the fixed oxidation state of Pt(IV), two of the four Nd-sites are partly occupied to provide charge neutrality, with the Nd4 site taking a split position. On heating, Nd10.67Pt4O24 decomposes into Nd2O3 and Pt. A plateau in the thermogravimetric curves measured in 33 vol. % O2 in N2 indicates the presence of an intermediate Pt(II) phase at around 960 {\deg}C, probably isostructural with La4PtO7.</description>

      <title>Point defect formation at finite temperatures with machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects dictate the properties of many functional materials. The standard approach to modelling the thermodynamics of defects relies on a static description, where the change in Gibbs free energy is approximated by the internal energy. This approach has a low computational cost, but ignores contributions from atomic vibrations and structural configurations that can be accessed at finite temperatures. We train a machine learning force field (MLFF) to explore dynamic defect behaviour using $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ and $\textit{V}{\mathrm{_{Te}^{+2}}}$ in CdTe as exemplars. We consider the different entropic contributions (e.g., electronic, spin, vibrational, orientational, and configurational) and compare methods to compute the defect free energies, ranging from a harmonic treatment to a fully anharmonic approach based on thermodynamic integration. We find that metastable configurations are populated at room temperature and thermal effects increase the predicted concentration of $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ by two orders of magnitude -- and can thus significantly affect the predicted properties. Overall, our study underscores the importance of finite-temperature effects and the potential of MLFFs to model defect dynamics at both synthesis and device operating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Competing phases of HfO$_2$ from multiple unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We show that 6 of these 7 remaining structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (o-FE), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (o-FE2), and and monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Electron Localization, Magnetic Order, and Jahn-Teller Distortion that Dictates LiMnO$_2$ Phase Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in Mn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn migration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the electrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio re-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that the generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN) density functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious stable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like order (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn) phase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the total energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and GGA with extended Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V) that are self-consistently determined, the experimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The calculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and spinel phases (around 5.8 eV) are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered layered structures (around 6.4 eV). The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear ordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the same direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency, which contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases with noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational entropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases are shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps &gt; 3 eV, computed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.</description>

      <title>Optical Signature of Flat Bands in Topological Hourglass Semimetal Nb3SiTe6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands in condensed matter provide a rich avenue for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we report an optical spectroscopy study of a topological hourglass semimetal Nb3SiTe6 with the electric field of the incident light parallel to its crystalline ab-plane. The ab-plane optical conductivity spectra of Nb3SiTe6 single crystals exhibit a remarkable peak-like feature around 1.20 eV, which is mainly contributed by the direct optical transitions between the two ab-initio-calculation-derived flat bands along the momentum direction Z-U. Our results pave the way for investigating exotic quantum phenomena based on the flat bands in topological hourglass semimetals.</description>

      <title>Axion insulator, Weyl points, quantum anomalous Hall effect and magnetic topological phase transition in Eu3In2As4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic topological phases attract much interest, such as the axion insulator, higher-order topology, Weyl semimetals, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Here, we predict that the axion insulator phase, magnetic Weyl points, and QAHE can be achieved in Eu3In2As4. Recently, the single-crystal Eu3In2As4 has been successfully synthesized, which exhibits an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Our first-principles calculations show that it lies on the phase boundary between multiple magnetic topological phases, and the magnetic anisotropy is weak, with an energy difference less than 1 meV. In the AFM state, it can be tuned to an axion insulator by tensile strain. The quantized axion angle $\theta = \pi$ and the magnetic higher-order topology are characterized by the parity index $Z_4 = 2$. By applying an external magnetic field, the induced ferromagnetic (FM) state becomes an ideal magnetic topological semimetal with a single pair of Weyl points or a nodal ring. The QAHE can be achieved in FM multilayer films of Eu3In2As4 on a magnetic insulating substrate.</description>

      <title>Capturing thin-film microstructure contributions during ultrafast laser-metal interactions using atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in the emerging fields of atomic and close-to-atomic scale manufacturing is underpinned by enhanced precision and optimization of laser-controlled nanostructuring. Understanding thin films' crystallographic orientations and microstructure effects becomes crucial for optimizing the laser-metallic thin film interactions; however, these effects remain largely unexplored at the atomic scale. Using a hybrid two-temperature model and molecular dynamics, we simulated ultrafast laser-metal interactions for gold thin films with varying crystallographic orientations and microstructure configurations. Microstructure features, namely grain size, grain topology, and local crystallographic orientation, controlled the rate and extent of lattice disorder evolution and phase transformation, particularly at lower applied fluences. Our simulations provided comprehensive insights encompassing both the nanomechanical and thermodynamic aspects of ultrafast laser-metal interactions at atomic resolution. Microstructure-aware/informed thin film fabrication and targeted defect engineering could improve the precision of nanoscale laser processing and potentially emerge as an energy-efficient optimization strategy.</description>

      <title>Electrical Manipulation of Spin Splitting Torque in Altermagnetic RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE), altermagnets can generate time-reversal-odd spin current and spin splitting torque (SST) with spin polarization parallel to the N\'eel vector. Hence the effective manipulation of SST would provide plenty of opportunities for designable spintronic devices, which remains elusive. Here, the electrical control of SST is achieved in altermagnetic RuO2, based on controllable N\'eel vector of RuO2 and N\'eel vector-dependent generation of SST. We demonstrate the current-induced switching of N\'eel vector via spin-orbit torque in RuO2 films, according to the reversible polarity of electrical transport measurements and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). The XMLD also unprecedentedly demonstrates that N\'eel vector really exists in altermagnets. The switching of N\'eel vector to the current direction and resultantly enhanced spin polarization parallel to the N\'eel vector brings about stronger ASSE-induced spin current. Our findings not only enrich the properties of altermagnets but also pave the way for high speed memories and nano-oscillators with excellent controllability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Probing the N\'eel order in altermagnetic RuO2 films by X-ray magnetic linear dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging altermagnetic RuO2 with both compensated magnetic moments and broken time-reversal symmetry possesses nontrivial magneto-electronic responses and nonrelativistic spin currents, which are closely related to magnetic easy axis. To probe the N\'eel order in RuO2, we conducted Ru M3-edge X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) measurement. For epitaxial RuO2 films, characteristic XMLD signals can be observed in either RuO2(100) and RuO2(110) at normal incidence or RuO2(001) at oblique incidence, and the signals disappear when test temperature exceeds N\'eel temperature. For nonepitaxial RuO2 films, the flat lines in the XMLD patterns of RuO2(100) and RuO2(110) demonstrate that there is no in-plane uniaxial alignment of N\'eel order in these samples, due to the counterbalanced N\'eel order of the twin crystals evidenced by X-ray diffraction phi-scan measurements. Our experimental results unambiguously demonstrate the antiferromagnetism in RuO2 films and reveal the spatial relation of N\'eel order to be parallel with RuO2 [001] crystalline axis. These research findings would deepen our understanding of RuO2 and other attractive altermagnetic materials applied in the field of spintronics.</description>

      <title>Optical evidence of the band reconstruction during the charge-density wave transition in annealed Kagome magnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Kagome magnet FeGe, the coexistence of electron correlation, charge-density wave (CDW), and magnetism renders it ideal to study their interactions. Here, we combined the optical spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures of FeGe annealed at different temperatures. Our observations reveal that the sample annealed at 320C experienced dramatic change in optical conductivity following the CDW transition. Specifically, a substantial portion of the spectral weight (SW) in the low-energy region ( &lt; 0.4 eV) was redistributed to the high-energy region (0.8 - 1.5 eV), suggesting a reconstruction of the band structure. The sample annealed at 560 C did not exhibit a CDW transition, but its SW transfer occurred progressively from 300 to 5 K. We noticed that: i) after the CDW transition, the sample annealed at 320 C showed similar tendency of SW transfer to that of the 560 C annealed sample; ii) the high-energy SW of both materials displayed a temperature dependence consistent with the magnetic roperties. Combining the first-principles calculations, we attribute the SW transfer to the band reconstruction triggered by the distortion of Ge1 atoms induced either by annealing at 560C or by the CDW transitions. This lattice distortion affects the energies of Fe 3d orbitals. Under the influence of Hund's rule coupling, the magnetic moment of Fe atoms is enhanced. Our findings elucidate the interactions among charge, lattice, and spin in FeGe, offering pivotal insights to modulate properties of this Kagome magnet.</description>

      <title>A diffuse-interface model for predicting the evolution of metallic negative electrodes and interfacial voids in solid-state batteries with homogeneous and polycrystalline solid electrolyte separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel diffuse-interface electrochemical model that simultaneously simulates the evolution of the metallic negative electrode and interfacial voids during the stripping and plating processes in solid-state batteries. The utility and validity of this model are demonstrated for the first time on a cell with a sodium (Na) negative electrode and a Na-$\beta^{\prime\prime}$-alumina ceramic solid electrolyte (SE) separator. Three examples are simulated. First, stripping and plating with a perfect electrode/electrolyte interface; second, stripping and plating with a single interfacial void at the electrode/electrolyte interface; third, stripping with multiple interfacial voids. Both homogeneous SE properties and polycrystalline SEs with either low or high conductivity grain boundaries (GBs) are considered for all three examples. Heterogeneous GB conductivity has no significant impact on the behavior with a perfect electrode/electrolyte interface. However, it does result in local changes to void growth due to interactions between the void edge and the GBs. The void growth rate is a linear function of the flux of Na atoms at the void edge, which in turn depends on the applied current density. We also show that the void coalescence rate increases with applied current density and can be marginally influenced by GB conductivity.</description>

      <title>Picosecond expansion in LaAlO3 resonantly driven by infrared-active phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast structural dynamics of LaAlO3 thin films driven by short mid-infrared laser pulses at 20 THz. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction reveals an immediate lattice expansion and an acoustic breathing mode of the film. First-principles theory and a spring-mass model identify the direct coupling between coherently driven infrared-active phonons and strain as the underlying mechanism. Time-resolved optical birefringence measurements confirm that the amplitude of this acoustic mode scales linearly with the pump fluence, which agrees with the theory. Furthermore, time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering indicates that THz excitation enhances crystallinity by inducing a non-thermal increase in structural symmetry originating from preexisting defects. These findings highlight the potential of a multimodal approach-combining time-resolved X-ray and optical measurements and first-principles theory-to elucidate and control structural dynamics in nanoscale materials.</description>

      <title>Growth of hexagonal BN crystals by traveling-solvent floating zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large, high-purity single-crystals of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are essential for exploiting its many desirable and interesting properties. Here, we demonstrate via X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy that h-BN crystals can be grown by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ). The diameters of grown boules range from 3 -- 5 mm with lengths from 2 -- 7 mm. Tomography indicates variable grain sizes within the boules, with the largest having areas of $\approx$ 1 mm $\times$ 2 mm and thickness $\approx$ 0.5 mm. Although the boules contain macroscale flux inclusions, the h-BN lattice itself is of high quality for samples grown under optimized conditions. The currently optimized growth procedure employs an Fe flux, moderate N$_2$ pressure ($P_{N2} \approx$ 6 bar), and a growth rate of 0.1 mm/h.Raman spectroscopy for an optimized sample gives an average linewidth of 7.7(2) cm$^{-1}$ for the $E_{2g}$ intralayer mode at 1365.46(4) cm$^{-1}$ and 1.0(1) cm$^{-1}$ for the $E_{2g}$ interlayer shear mode at 51.78(9) cm$^{-1}$. The corresponding photoluminescence spectrum shows sharp phonon-assisted free exciton peaks and minimal signal in the energy range corresponding to carbon-related defects ($E$ = 3.9 -- 4.1 eV). Our work demonstrates the viability of growing h-BN by the TSFZ technique, thereby opening a new route towards larger, high-quality crystals and advancing the state of h-BN related research.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>

      <title>DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 software: A suite of real-time path integral methods for the simulation of dynamical properties and vibrational spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 is introduced here as a highly modular, sustainable, and scalable general-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software for large-scale long-time MD simulations of condensed phase and interfacial systems with the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) included. The new release improves upon version 2.0 through the introduction of several emerging real-time path integral (PI) methods, including fast centroid molecular dynamics (f-CMD) and fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) methods, as well as our recently introduced hybrid CMD (h-CMD) method for the accurate and efficient simulation of vibrational infrared spectra. Several test cases, including liquid bulk water at 300 K and ice Ih at 150 K, are used to showcase the performance of different implemented PI methods in simulating the infrared spectra at both ambient conditions and low temperatures where NQEs become more apparent. Additionally, using different salt-in-water (i.e., dilute) and water-in-salt (i.e., concentrated) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) aqueous electrolyte solutions, we demonstrate the applicability of our recently introduced h-CMD method implemented in DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 for the large scale simulation of IR spectra of complex heterogeneous systems. We show that h-CMD can overcome the curvature problem of CMD and the artificial broadening of T-RPMD for the accurate simulation of the vibrational spectra of complex, heterogeneous systems with NQEs included.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX3-based (X = S, Se) heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the explorations of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX3 (X = S, Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting arises in the AA-stacking MnPX3/MPX3 (M = Cd, Mg, Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting emerges in the AB-stacking configurations. Combining MnPX3 and ferroelectric substrates like CuInP2S6 results in switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on band structures, which can be tuned by applying out-of-plane electric fields to non-volatilely reversing the ferroelectric polarization. In summary, our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Emerging Microelectronic Materials by Design: Navigating Combinatorial Design Space with Scarce and Dispersed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover, the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing methods to mitigate the gaps.</description>

      <title>A crack-length control technique for phase field fracture in FFT homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the propagation of cracks at the microscopic level is fundamental to understand the effect of the microstructure on the fracture process. Nevertheless, microscopic propagation is often unstable and when using phase field fracture poor convergence is found or, in the case of using staggered algorithms, leads to the presence of jumps in the evolution of the cracks. In this work, a novel method is proposed to perform micromechanical simulations with phase field fracture imposing monotonic increases of crack length and allowing the use of monolithic implementations, being able to resolve all the snap-backs during the unstable propagation phases. The method is derived for FFT based solvers in order to exploit its very high numerical performance n micromechanical problems, but an equivalent method is also developed for Finite Elements (FE) showing the equivalence of both implementations. It is shown that the stress-strain curves and the crack paths obtained using the crack control method are superposed in stable propagation regimes to those obtained using strain control with a staggered scheme. J-integral calculations confirm that during the propagation process in the crack control method, the energy release rate remains constant and equal to an effective fracture energy that has been determined as function of the discretization for FFT simulations. Finally, to show the potential of the method, the technique is applied to simulate crack propagation through the microstructure of composites and porous materials providing an estimation of the effective fracture toughness.</description>

      <title>Carbon-based light emitting defects in different layers of hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered significant interest as single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their remarkable optical and quantum properties. An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Bismuth doping induced enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling strength in the prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive studies on the impact of bismuth incorporation into the (Ga,Mn)As prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) on its structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties are summarized in this review. Thin epitaxial layers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) compound, containing up to 1% Bi and 6% Mn atoms, and the reference ternary (Ga,Mn)As compound, have been grown under either a compressive or tensile biaxial misfit strain by the low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy technique with precisely optimized growth conditions. The high-resolution X-ray diffractometry measurements and transmission electron microscopy imaging of cross-sections across the sample interfaces have evidenced for high structural perfection of the DFS layers and sharp interfaces with the substrate. An addition of bismuth into the layers causes a small decrease in their ferromagnetic Curie temperature and a distinct increase in the coercive fields, as revealed by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry investigations. Most of all, the incorporation of a small atomic fraction of heavy Bi atoms, substituting As atoms in the layer, predominantly enhances the spin-orbit coupling strength in its valence band, considerably affecting electromagnetic properties of the layers. Investigations of magnetotransport properties of the DFS layers, performed on micro-Hall-bars prepared from the layers using electron-beam lithography patterning, reveal, as a result of Bi addition to the layers, significantly enhanced magnitudes of magnetoresistance, anomalous and planar Hall effects as well as the spin-orbit torque effect. The latter effect is of special interest for applications to the next generation non-volatile data storage and logic spintronic devices, utilizing electrically controlled magnetization reversal.</description>

      <title>Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</description>

      <title>Buried Interfaces and Spin Orientation in [Co/Pt]10 /Fe multilayer with Orthogonal Magnetic Anisotropy: Effect of Fe Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, spin orientation and variation of the strength of coupling in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer have been investigated as a function of the thickness of the Fe layer. [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer has orthogonal anisotropy with the Fe layer, and [Co/Pt]ML has in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular anisotropy, respectively. Measurements are performed using in-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and isotope-sensitive depth-resolved nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) technique. Real-time in-situ MOKE measurement during Fe growth reveals that with an increase in thickness of the Fe layer, moments of Fe layer reorientation from out of the plane to in-plane direction. This is attributed to the decrease in the coupling between the [Co/Pt]ML and Fe layer. For the depth-dependent study, two [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayers having the same thickness but different positions of the Fe57 marker layer ([Co/Pt]MLFe/Fe57) and [Co/Pt]MLFe57/Fe ) were studied using the NRS technique. Films with varying external magnetic fields were also studied to investigate coupling strength. Measurements were performed under the x-ray standing wave conditions to enhance resonance yield. It is observed that for the 75 {\AA} Fe in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer, the coupling varies along the depth of the Fe layer. The coupling is strong at [Co/Pt]ML and Fe interface with spins of the Fe layer aligned in the out-of-plane direction, whereas moments away from the interface are weakly coupled and aligned in-plane along the magnetic easy axis. Due to this gradient in strength of coupling along the depth, a large magnetic field is required to reorient spins at the interface along the magnetic hard axis of the Fe layer; however, spins away from the interface can rotate freely even in the low magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an anomalous non-evaporating sub-nanometre water layer in open environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water exhibits complex behaviors as a result of hydrogen bonding, and low-dimensional confined water plays a key role in material science, geology, and biology science. Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies. NV center magnetic resonance technology provides an opportunity to overcome these limitations, offering non-contact atomic-scale measurements with chemical resolution capability. In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding. These findings provide new perspectives and a platform for studying the structure and behavior of low-dimensional water, as well as the surface properties influenced by adsorbed water under native conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of ferroic domain patterns by thermal quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the domain structure of ferroic materials is key to manipulating their functionality. Typically, quasi-static electric, magnetic, or strain fields are exploited to transform or pole ferroic domains. In contrast, metallurgy makes use of fast thermal quenches across phase transitions to create new functional states and domain structures. This approach employs the rapid temporal evolution of systems far from equilibrium to overcome the constraints imposed by comparably slow interactions. However, guiding the nonequilibrium evolution of domains towards otherwise inaccessible configurations remains largely unexplored in ferroics. Here, we harness thermal quenches to exert control over a ferroic domain pattern. Cooling at variable speed triggers transitions between two ferroic phases in a rare-earth orthoferrite, with transient domain evolution enabling the selection of the final domain pattern. Specifically, by tuning the quench rate, we can either generate the intrinsic domain structure of the low-temperature phase or transfer the original pattern of the high-temperature phase - creating a hidden metastable domain configuration inaccessible at thermal equilibrium. Real-time imaging during rapid quenching reveals two distinct time scales governing domain evolution: a fast fragmentation phase, followed by a slower relaxation towards a new pattern or back to the original one. This dynamic control of domain configurations, alongside external fields, strain engineering, and all-optical switching, offers a novel approach for actively manipulating ferroic order.</description>

      <title>Effect of arsenic doping on structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the properties of the 2D ferromagnet CrSBr by lanthanide doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials stems from their unique properties and potential applications in spintronics, magnonics and quantum information technologies. Among them, CrSBr is a semiconductor that stands out, owing to its high Curie temperature (TC ~ 146 K), air stability and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the effects of Dy doping (12.5%, 25%, and 50%) on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CrSBr monolayer. Our results reveal that Dy incorporation enhances magnetic anisotropy, modulates TC, and can create quasi-1D ferromagnetic chains that arise from competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Additionally, we investigate the properties of DySBr, DySI and DySeI monolayers, which are isostructural to the CrSBr. Our results reveal the feasibility of exfoliating them down to the single-layer and the presence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, relying on the combination of both weak exchange interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. This work provides insights into tuning the properties of CrSBr through rare earth doping, unlocking new possibilities for advanced applications at the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Ab initio theory of the non-resonant Raman effect in crystals at finite temperature in comparison to experiment: The examples of GaN and BaZrS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ab initio theory of the non-resonant Raman scattering process in crystals at finite temperature in direct comparison with experiments. The theory incorporates the scattering geometry and polarization dependence of the Raman process and the small but finite wave vectors of the phonons for correctly describing the scattering with longitudinal optical (LO) modes in optically anisotropic solids. We implement the theory for first-order Raman scattering and showcase the approach for wurtzite Gallium Nitride and the complex chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3 in comparison to experiment. We subsequently discuss several common estimates for second-order Raman scattering in complex materials, and highlight similarities and differences to established theoretical approaches and simulation protocols both from phonon theory and molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physically Intuitive Anisotropic Model of Hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardness of materials plays an important role in material design. There are numerous experimental methods to measure the hardness of materials, but theoretical prediction of hardness is challenging. By investigating the correlation between hardness and the elastic properties of materials, namely shear and bulk moduli, the pressure derivative of bulk modulus, we have constructed a simple and physically intuitive hardness model. By introducing the spatial variation of the shear modulus, it is possible to predict the hardness anisotropy of materials to define the minimum and maximum values of hardness possessed by a particular material. Furthermore, by using the equation of states to define the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, it is possible to determine the temperature dependencies of hardness for given materials. All quantities in the model can be obtained directly from accurate first-principles calculations or from experiments, making it suitable for practical applications.</description>

      <title>A unified and consistent electrical double layer model for treatment of core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical double layer (EDL) is fundamental to the operation of devices for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Existing models of EDL in solid electrolytes focus predominantly on the space charge layer and lack a complete treatment of the core layer which is an integral part of the EDL. The core layer exhibits significant variations in defect properties, such as defect formation energy (DFE), which influence the ionic charge carrier distribution in the space charge layer. In this work, we develop a general framework for treating both the core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes under dilute and concentrated regimes. We incorporate functional forms of the DFE variation in the core layer and defect-defect interactions that are consistent with previous first-principles simulations of solid electrolytes at surfaces and interfaces. Our simulations reveal that the core layer significantly impacts the potential distribution and defect concentrations in the solid electrolyte. In addition, the core contributes substantially to the conductivity when the surface DFE is much lower than the bulk DFE. Our model paves the way for accurate calculations of properties such as capacitance and ionic conductivity of solid-solid interfaces required for enhancing and optimizing the performance of solid-state electrochemical devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of hybrid perovskite materials are important for device flexibility, resistance to fracture, epitaxial growth, surface energetics of quantum dots, and induction or relief of stress in thin films due to thermal expansion and phase changes. These issues are particularly salient for solar cells in space applications. Nonetheless, few studies are available on the mechanical properties of the paradigmatic hybrid perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPI). Experimental results are only available for the room-temperature tetragonal phase, and there are significant discrepancies among them. Results from density functional theory (DFT) are available for all three phases but have even larger discrepancies from each other and from experiments. To clarify the disorder in the literature, we have studied the elastic properties of all three phases in detail with DFT calculations. We have examined the effect of different aspects in calculation methodology such as use of energy or stress, the structure, exchange-correlation functionals, Van der Waals corrections, pseudopotentials, $k$-point sampling, and formulas for anisotropic elasticity and polycrystalline averages. Our results provide accurate reference values and an appropriate general methodology for elastic properties of metal halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the quantum geometric tensor in solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the geometric properties of quantum states and their implications in fundamental physical phenomena is at the core of modern physics. The Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) is a central physical object in this regard, encoding complete information about the geometry of the quantum state. The imaginary part of the QGT is the well-known Berry curvature, which plays a fundamental role in the topological magnetoelectric and optoelectronic phenomena. The real part of the QGT is the quantum metric, whose importance has come to prominence very recently, giving rise to a new set of quantum geometric phenomena, such as anomalous Landau levels, flat band superfluidity, excitonic Lamb shifts, and nonlinear Hall effect. Despite the central importance of the QGT, its experimental measurements have been restricted only to artificial two-level systems. In this work, we develop a framework to measure the QGT (both quantum metric and Berry curvature) in crystalline solids using polarization-, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Using this framework, we demonstrate the effective reconstruction of the QGT in solids in the archetype kagome metal CoSn, which hosts topological flat bands. The key idea is to introduce another geometrical tensor, the quasi-QGT, whose components, the band Drude weight and orbital angular momentum, are experimentally accessible and can be used for extracting the QGT. Establishing such a momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopic probe of the QGT is poised to significantly advance our understanding of quantum geometric responses in a wide range of crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Spectral Anomaly Detection in EELS Spectral Images via Three Dimensional Convolutional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Three-Dimensional Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (3D-CVAE) for automated anomaly detection in Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy Spectrum Imaging (EELS-SI) data. Our approach leverages the full three-dimensional structure of EELS-SI data to detect subtle spectral anomalies while preserving both spatial and spectral correlations across the datacube. By employing negative log-likelihood loss and training on bulk spectra, the model learns to reconstruct bulk features characteristic of the defect-free material. In exploring methods for anomaly detection, we evaluated both our 3D-CVAE approach and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), testing their performance using Fe L-edge peak shifts designed to simulate material defects. Our results show that 3D-CVAE achieves superior anomaly detection and maintains consistent performance across various shift magnitudes. The method demonstrates clear bimodal separation between normal and anomalous spectra, enabling reliable classification. Further analysis verifies that lower dimensional representations are robust to anomalies in the data. While performance advantages over PCA diminish with decreasing anomaly concentration, our method maintains high reconstruction quality even in challenging, noise-dominated spectral regions. This approach provides a robust framework for unsupervised automated detection of spectral anomalies in EELS-SI data, particularly valuable for analyzing complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Josephson Field Effect Transistors with InAs on Insulator and High Permittivity Gate Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has recently been demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting electronics, which features an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, compared to the conventional thermally-growth SiO2. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Electron Detectors for Dark Matter-Nucleon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper now a decade old, it was shown that dark matter detectors geared at probing interactions with nucleons could also be used to probe dark matter interactions with electrons. In this work, we show that new detector concepts designed to probe dark matter-electron interactions at low masses can similarly be used to probe new parameter space for dark matter-nucleon interactions. We demonstrate the power of this approach by using existing data from superconducting detectors to place new limits on the interactions of nuclei with MeV-scale dark matter. Further, we show that advances in detector technology that have been anticipated for electronic interactions will automatically extend sensitivity deep into uncharted territory for nuclear interactions. This doubles the effective science output of future low-threshold experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Driven Electron Transport through Fano-Anderson Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic transport behavior of Fano-Anderson (FA) systems, consisting of a one-dimensional finite backbone chain and an attached side-group of varying length. The tight-binding model within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) reveals distinct interference patterns between the frontier orbitals of odd and even side-group systems that lead to distinct transport mechanisms across various configurations. The even side-group systems exhibit resonant tunneling peaks, while the odd ones demonstrate significant destructive interference at Fermi energy leading to antiresonance and reduced current responses. Further exploration of the role of electron-electron interactions within mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian indicates the emergence of negative differential resistance (NDR) in odd side-group systems at lower biases, a phenomenon absent in the non-interacting case. Our study demonstrates the critical role of quantum interferences among the frontier molecular orbitals and electron correlations in shaping the transport behavior of FA systems, providing insights for the design of molecular-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Large tunable Josephson diode effect in a side-contacted topological-insulator-nanowire junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire based Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Tunable Assembly of Confined Janus Microswimmers in Sub-kHz Electic Fields under Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems comprising micron-sized self-propelling units, also termed microswimmers, are promising candidates for the bottom-up assembly of small structures and reconfigurable materials. Here we leverage field-driven colloidal assembly to induce structural transformations in dense layers of microswimmers driven by an alternating current (AC) electric field and confined in a microfabricated trap under the influence of gravity. By varying the electric field frequency, we realize significant structural transformations, from a gas-like state at high frequencies to dynamically rearranging dense crystalline clusters at lower frequencies, characterized by vorticity in their dynamics. We demonstrate the ability to switch between these states on-demand, showing that the clustering mechanism differs from motility-induced phase separation. Our results offer a valuable framework for designing high-density active matter systems with controllable structural properties, envisioned to advance the development of artificial materials with self-healing and reconfiguration capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory for nontrivial topology of band structure in metallic helimagnets is developed. Two theorems on electron dispersion in helimagnets are proved. They reveal a Kramers-like degeneracy in helical magnetic field. The generalized Bloch theorem together with periodic boundary conditions lead to a nontrivial topological band structure. As a result, an unusual spin structure of electron bands appears. A 2D model of nearly free electrons is proposed to describe conductive hexagonal palladium layers under an effective field of magnetically ordered CrO$_2$ spacers in PdCrO$_2$. The spin texture of the Fermi surface induces abnormal conductivity and nonreciprocity of electronic transport. It is shown that the topological metal state is closely related to unconventional antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Interface-sensitive microwave loss in superconducting tantalum films sputtered on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence in superconducting circuits has increased steadily over the last decades as a result of a growing understanding of the various loss mechanisms. Recently, tantalum (Ta) emerged as a promising material to address microscopic sources of loss found on niobium (Nb) or aluminum (Al) surfaces. However, the effects of film and interface microstructure on low-temperature microwave loss are still not well understood. Here we present a systematic study of the structural and electrical properties of Ta and Nb films sputtered on c-plane sapphire at varying growth temperatures. As growth temperature is increased, our results show that the onset of epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-phase Ta correlates with lower Ta surface roughness, higher critical temperature, and higher residual resistivity ratio, but surprisingly also correlates with a significant increase in loss at microwave frequency. We determine that the source of loss is located at the Ta/sapphire interface and show that it can be fully mitigated by either growing a thin, epitaxial Nb inter-layer between the Ta film and the substrate or by intentionally treating the sapphire surface with \textit{in-situ} argon plasma before Ta growth. In addition to elucidating this interfacial microwave loss, this work provides adequate process details that should allow for the reproducible growth of low-loss Ta film across fabrication facilities.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become ubiquitous in materials modelling and now routinely enables large-scale atomistic simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex (`automatic potential-landscape explorer'). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium-oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning -- with a long-term vision of making it a genuine mainstream tool in physics, chemistry, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbital-Selective Band Reconstruction in an Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Kagome Metal TbTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Reduced Wannier Representation for Topological Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a procedure for constructing a maximally localized Wannier basis for a subspace of bands with a non-zero Chern number. Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we analyze the limits of using the projection procedure to obtain a Wannierizable subspace from a set of topologically obstructed bands. The Wannier functions from this subspace form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. We consider the Haldane tight-binding model in the Chern phase as the platform for our investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the first fully analytic derivation and implementation of nuclear gradients for the G$_0$W$_0$ method. For this, we leverage the recently established connection between the G$_0$W$_0$ approach and equation-of-motion unitary coupled-cluster theory for charged excitations [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 124123 (2023)]. Analytic gradients are obtained through the Lagrangian technique and are implemented and validated by comparison with finite-difference calculations. For G$_0$W$_0$, we examine the effect of the Tamm--Dancoff approximation for evaluating the screened Coulomb interaction. Finally, we compare G$_0$W$_0$ adiabatic ionization potential and electron affinities to wavefunction-based electronic structure methods, and experimental values.</description>

      <title>Supercell Wannier Functions and Emergent Kondo Lattices in Topological Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional theories for Mott insulators involve well-localized electronic orbitals. This picture fails in the presence of topological obstructions in Chern bands which prevent the formation of exponentially localized orbitals and are instead often viewed by analogy to Landau levels. Here, we show that strong interactions in fractionally-filled topological bands realize a class of Mott insulating states on emergent topological Kondo lattices. These can be naturally described by a partial Wannier basis of N-1 exponentially-localized orbitals for an N-band manifold with net non-zero Chern number. Choosing a gauge which breaks translation symmetry, we construct a supercell basis which segregates an isolated topological band into well-localized supercell Wannier orbitals that can host the local moments of a Mott insulating state, as well as an itinerant power-law-localized orbital that retains the topological obstruction. Together, they constitute a spontaneous Kondo lattice. We study fractionally-filled interacting quantum spin Hall bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model as well as twisted bilayers of MoTe2 at -1/3 filling. We demonstrate that strong short-ranged Coulomb interactions can stabilize a new class of topological Mott insulating states with broken translation symmetry and antiferromagnetic order, which compete with fractional Chern insulating states. Our results predict a new scenario for time-reversal-symmetric interacting topological bands in solids, beyond conventional Landau level paradigms for the fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>An accurate and efficient framework for predictive insights into ionic surface chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to ionic surfaces with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve long-standing debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering valuable benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is completely open-source, making it possible to now routinely apply cWFT to complex problems in ionic surface chemistry.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Kitaev Interaction and Off-diagonal Exchanges: Exotic Phases and Quantum Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning with the everlasting search for quantum spin liquids (QSLs), identifying the QSL in Kitaev magnets has garnered great research interest during the past decade and remains nevertheless an enormous challenge. One of the major difficulties lies in that Kitaev QSL is typically fragile against competing interactions like off-diagonal exchanges, which are ubiquitous in real materials due to spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effect. This, in turn, gives rise to many intriguing field-induced novel phases and thermal Hall effect. In this review, we will focus on the interplay of Kitaev interaction and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ exchanges from a numerical perspective. This review discusses some representative exotic phases such as $\Gamma$ spin liquid, nematic ferromagnet, spin-flop phase, and distinct chiral-spin states with spontaneously time-reversal symmetry breaking. It also presents quantum phase diagrams of anisotropic Kitaev-$\Gamma$ chains that exhibit kaleidoscopes of both ordered and disordered phases.</description>

      <title>First-Principles' Derived Force Field for hBN Nanostrucrtures; Applications to Monolayers, Nanotubes and Nanotori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. An analytical expression has been provided for the dependence of the bending rigidity of relatively large diameter hBN nanotubes on their radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance effect lays the foundation for spintronics, magnetic sensors and hard drives. The pursuit of magnetic materials with colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and/or angular magnetoresistance (AMR) has attracted enduring research interest and extensive investigations over past decades. Here we report on the discovery of field-induced record-breaking CMR of ~ -10^14 % and AMR ~ 10^14% achieved simultaneously in an antiferromagnetic rare-earth dichalcogenide EuSe2. Such intriguing observations are attributed to strong magnetic anisotropy and magnetic-field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the localized Eu2+ spins, which in turn closes the bandgap by lifting the degeneracy of Se-5p bands near Fermi level. Our DFT calculations perfectly replicate the experimental findings based on the Brillouin function and carries transport model. The present work provides a potential simple antiferromagnetic material for achieving angle-sensitive spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Refining the Two-Band Model for Highly Compensated Semimetals Using Thermoelectric Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful to capture electrical conductivities with intuitive parameters of densities and mobilities of electron-like and hole-like carriers, as well as to predict their magnetic field dependence. Yet, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst ($S_{xy}$) coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with field, respectively. Such field dependences were predicted by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and the Mott relation of the two-band system, and they are realized when two conditions are simultaneously met [1]: the multiple of cyclotron frequency ($\omega_c$) and relaxation time ($\tau$) is much larger than one, $\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and the tangent of Hall angle ($\theta_H$) is much smaller than one, $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. We use the relation between two carrier densities $n_e$ (electron-like) and $n_h$ (hole-like) derived from the field dependence of the TE coefficients, to refine the two-band model fittings. The compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$, where $\Delta n = n_e-n_h$) is found two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in the unrestricted fitting and hence the larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the framework of the semiclassical theory, we deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}\times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$. Our findings offer crucial insights not only for identifying the empirical conditions for the field-induced enhancement of the TE performance but also for engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</description>

      <title>Enforced symmetry breaking for anomalous valley Hall effect in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is a pivotal phenomenon that allows for the exploitation of the valley degree of freedom in materials. A general strategy for its realization and manipulation is crucial for valleytronics. Here, by considering all possible symmetries, we propose general rules for the realization and manipulation of AVHE in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices. The realization of AVHE requires breaking the enforced symmetry that is associated with different valleys or reverses the sign of Berry curvature. Further manipulation of AVHE requires asymmetry operators connecting two states with opposite signs of Berry curvature. These rules for realizing and manipulating AVHE are extendable to generic points in momentum space. Combined with first-principles calculations, we realize the controllable AVHE in four representative systems, i.e., monolayer AgCrP2Se6, CrOBr, FeCl2 and bilayer TcGeSe3. Our work provides symmetry rules for designing valleytronic materials that could facilitate the experimental detection and realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Incorporating precipitation-related effects on plastic anisotropy of age-hardenable aluminium alloys into crystal plasticity constitutive models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal plasticity finite element simulations are frequently employed to predict the plastic anisotropy of polycrystalline metals based on their crystallographic texture. In age-hardenable aluminium alloys, however, the texture-induced plastic anisotropy is known to affect by precipitation. This paper presents a new modelling approach to incorporate this effect into crystal plasticity constitutive models. The approach focuses on the overall effect of precipitation, which is assumed to result in an additional directional dependency with respect to a global material orientation, superimposed with the texture-induced plastic anisotropy. This additional directional dependency is implemented into a conventional crystal plasticity constitutive model via a modified hardening law that introduces two new parameters, of which only one is treated as a free parameter. To demonstrate the applicability of the new modelling approach, it is applied to an age-hardenable AA6014-T4 aluminium alloy and compared against a state-of-the-art crystal plasticity constitutive model that considers only crystallographic texture. The results demonstrate that the new modelling approach significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the plastic anisotropy for the AA6014-T4 aluminium alloy studied.</description>

To verify the stability of these hydrides, first-principles investigations are employed to examine their structural, electronic and hydrogen storage properties. According to structural studies these compositions hydrides are stable and part of the cubic space group (221 Pm-3m). We have examined many aspects of these compositions throughout, using the PBE-GGA exchange correlation potential. We obtained the energy versus volume curve and found the stable phase and structural parameter of these hydrides using equation of state given by Birch-Murnaghan's. These hydrides thermodynamic stability is expressed in terms of their gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity.The goal of this study is to compute the standard enthalpy of formation and thermal desorption to ascertain the stability of these hydrides. Based on band structure and density of state plots it is found that these compositions are metallic in nature. The study presents a preliminary theoretical approach for hydrogen storage applications of thermoelectric compositions, revealing their strong thermoelectric responses and potential for green energy sources.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear photomagnetization is a process by which an oscillating electric field induces a static magnetization. We show that all 32 crystallographic point groups admit such spin polarization using circularly polarized electric fields to second order (as in the usual spin orientation or inverse Faraday effect) but only 29 points groups admit spin polarization using linearly polarized electric fields to second order. The excluded point groups are the highly symmetric $m$-3$m$, -$43m$ and 432. Using density functional theory we compute the spectrum of the second-order electric spin susceptibility of prototypical semiconductors Te, Se, SnS$_2$, GaAs, InSb and Si which corresponds to nonmagnetic materials with and without inversion symmetry. We show that nonlinear photomagnetization can be comparable to those of naturally occurring ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Janus MoSSe nanotubes on one-dimensional SWCNT-BNNT van der Waals heterostructures</title>

Abstract: 2D Janus TMDC layers with broken mirror symmetry exhibit giant Rashba splitting and unique excitonic behavior. For their 1D counterparts, the Janus nanotubes possess curvature, which introduce an additional degree of freedom to break the structural symmetry. This could potentially enhance these effects or even give rise to novel properties. In addition, Janus MSSe nanotubes (M=W, Mo), with diameters surpassing 40 {\AA} and Se positioned externally, consistently demonstrate lower energy states than their Janus monolayer counterparts. However, there have been limited studies on the preparation of Janus nanotubes, due to the synthesis challenge and limited sample quality. Here we first synthesized MoS2 nanotubes based on SWCNT-BNNT heterostructure and then explored the growth of Janus MoSSe nanotubes from MoS2 nanotubes with the assistance of H2 plasma at room temperature. The successful formation of the Janus structure was confirmed via Raman spectroscopy, and microscopic morphology and elemental distribution of the grown samples were further characterized. The synthesis of Janus MoSSe nanotubes based on SWCNT-BNNT enables the further exploration of novel properties in Janus TMDC nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Stress Predictions in Polycrystal Plasticity using Graph Neural Networks with Subgraph Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of polycrystal plasticity is computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Giant Topological Hall Effect in Magnetic Weyl Metal Mn$_{2}$Pd$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synergy between real and reciprocal space topology is anticipated to yield a diverse array of topological properties in quantum materials. We address this pursuit by achieving topologically safeguarded magnetic order in novel Weyl metallic Heusler alloy, Mn$_{2}$Pd$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. The system possesses non-centrosymmetric D$_{2d}$ crystal symmetry with notable spin-orbit coupling effects. Our first principles calculations confirm the topological non-trivial nature of band structure, including 42 pairs of Weyl nodes at/near the Fermi level, offering deeper insights into the observed anomalous Hall effect mediated by intrinsic Berry curvature. A unique canted magnetic ordering facilitates such rich topological features, manifesting through an exceptionally large topological Hall effect at low fields. The latter is sustained even at room temperature and compared with other known topological magnetic materials. Detailed micromagnetic simulations demonstrate the possible existence of an antiskyrmion lattice. Our results underscore the $D_{2d}$ Heusler magnets as a possible platform to explore the intricate interplay of non-trivial topology across real and reciprocal spaces to leverage a plethora of emergent properties for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Thermal transport in nanostructures plays a critical role in modern technologies. As devices shrink, techniques that can measure thermal properties at nanometer and nanosecond scales are increasingly needed to capture transient, out-of-equilibrium phenomena. We present a novel pump-probe photon-electron method within a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map temperature dynamics with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. By combining focused laser-induced heating and synchronized time-resolved monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we track phonon, exciton and plasmon signals in various materials, including silicon nitride, aluminum thin film, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results demonstrate the technique's ability to follow temperature changes at the nanometer and nanosecond scales. The experimental data closely matched theoretical heat diffusion models, confirming the method's validity. This approach opens new opportunities to investigate transient thermal phenomena in nanoscale materials, offering valuable insights for applications in thermoelectric devices and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 13 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>

      <title>Sodium diffusion in alkali feldspars: Towards the impact of Al/Si ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracer diffusion of Na in natural alkali feldspars including sanidine, adularia and orthoclase with different Na:K ratios is measured using the radiotracer technique and applying the 22Na radioisotope. The tracer diffusion measurements along the crystallographic directions perpendicular to (001) and (010) in alularia feldspar reveled a slight (within a factor of two to three) anisotropy of Na diffusion with the faster diffusion rates along the perpendicular to (001) directions, while this difference was less prominent in orthoclase. The anisotropy of Na diffusion is specifically addressed for orthoclase and the full diffusion tensor is determined. The impact of temperature and composition on diffusion in natural alkali feldspars is discussed with respect to impurities and intrinsic defects. The state of Al/Si ordering is proposed to have a significant influence on the Na diffusion rates in alkali feldspars.</description>

      <title>Tailoring MBE Growth of c-Mn3Sn Directly on MgO (111): From Islands to Film</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our study of (0001) oriented Mn$_3$Sn (c-Mn$_3$Sn) thin films synthesized directly on an MgO (111) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. We identify a growth window where Mn$_3$Sn growth can be controlled through slight adjustments of the Mn flux, achieving either $\mu$m$^2$-sized high crystalline-quality islands or an almost completely continuous film. High-resolution X-ray diffraction results indicate that both films are highly (0001) oriented. The atomic resolution images show clear film-substrate interfaces displaying an epitaxial relationship. Scanning precession electron diffraction measurements reveal that the island featured sample has highly crystallized Mn$_3$Sn. The sample featuring a high continuity exhibits defects in some areas but retains the dominant Mn$_3$Sn structure. This work demonstrates a potential method for synthesizing high crystalline-quality Mn$_3$Sn films with substantial coverage, facilitating the study of Mn3Sn films without the influence of an additional buffer layer and promoting their application in integrated spintronics.</description>

Abstract: The present study was conducted on dispersed YBa2Cu3O6+d (YBCO) during its hydration in gas-tight containers with K2CO3X1.5H2O crystal hydrate. The samples were exposed to an electromagnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz or microwave radiation of 2 GHz. Changes in the weight of various bodies located in the immediate vicinity of containers with YBCO material were detected: when above the containers, the bodies lose weight, while the weight of bodies located under the containers, on the contrary, increases. The maximum weight defect recorded in experiments with a 5 g YBCO sample was about 1 mg. Discovered weight changes are very similar to the result obtained by E.E. Podkletnov et al. [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992. V. 203. P. 441] - they observed a decrease in the weight of bodies placed above a rotating YBCO disk which was in a superconducting state and exposed to an alternating magnetic field. Podkletnov and other researchers put forward a hypothesis about screening of the gravitational field by the rotating YBCO-superconductor. Distinctive features of our experiments are the absence of the superconducting state in the YBCO material and its rotation. However, it is clear to us that we have observed the same phenomenon and, to our knowledge, this is probably the first time that Podkletnov effect has been confirmed in an independent study. Our interpretation of the effect differs from the initial one. According to our results, the YBCO material initiates a redistribution between bodies of a certain substance that affects their weight or mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an efficient momentum space approach to the superconductivity in quasiperiodic multilayer systems. To this end, we extend the Brillouin zone (BZ) folding method to the superconducting (SC) phases by formulating the gap equation in the momentum space representation with the BZ folding. We show that the physical observables in quasiperiodic multilayers are generally given by so-called quasiperiodic functions. Consequently, there appear SC order parameters with finite momenta in the BZ folding method, which corresponds to the spatial fluctuation of the SC order in quasiperiodic multilayers. We also find a systematic way to compute the physical observables in the BZ folding method with a proper normalization condition using the continued fraction approximation. We apply the BZ folding method to a one-dimensional toy model of quasiperiodic superconductors and demonstrate its numerical efficiency compared to the conventional method based on the real space representation with a large system size. We also study a quasiperiodic bilayer system of Rice-Mele model and an s-wave superconductor to demonstrate an efficient computation of optical responses of a quasiperiodic superconductor with inversion symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for understanding diffuse multiple scattering (DMS) in single crystals, focusing on diffuse scattering-Bragg (DS-Bragg) channels. These channels, when probed with high-flux, low-divergent monochromatic synchrotron X-rays, provide well-defined visualizations of Kossel lines. Our main contribution lies in modeling the intensity distribution along these lines by considering DS around individual reciprocal lattice nodes. The model incorporates contributions from both general DS and mosaicity, elucidating their connection to second-order scattering events. This comprehensive approach advances our understanding of DMS phenomena, enabling their use as probes for complex material behavior, particularly under extreme conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows to control the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Hall transport in the topological non-Hermitian checkerboard lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The checkerboard lattice is a two-dimensional non-trivial structure usually seen as a planar version of the pyrochlore lattice. This geometry supports a two-band insulating electronic system with Chern topology induced by a complex hopping parameter. Inspired by the recent advances in the topology of non-Hermitian systems, in this work we study a non-Hermitian version of the topological checkerboard lattice. The complex band structure and Berry curvature are calculated. In the insulating phase, the Chern number is the same as in the Hermitian version, but the Hall conductivity is no longer quantized. The dependence of the Hall conductivity with the non-Hermitian parameters is investigated. The non-Hermiticity can be seen as a result of dissipation caused by coupling the system to the environment, so this study casts light on the topology of open systems in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Consecutive Flat Chern Bands and Correlated States in Monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave may appear in these Chern bands with $1/3$ filling. Furthermore, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class of materials such as ReAg$_2$Br$_6$, ReAu$_2$I$_6$ and ReCu$_2X_6$ ($X$=Cl, Br, I). These notable predictions in pristine 2D materials, if realized experimentally, could offer a new playground for exploring correlated topological states at elevated temperature.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of Graph Neural Network Force Fields for Predicting Solid-State Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) promise to offer a computationally efficient alternative to ab initio simulations for complex molecular systems. However, ensuring their generalizability beyond training data is crucial for their wide application in studying solid materials. This work investigates the ability of a graph neural network (GNN)-based MLFF, trained on Lennard-Jones Argon, to describe solid-state phenomena not explicitly included during training. We assess the MLFF's performance in predicting phonon density of states (PDOS) for a perfect face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at both zero and finite temperatures. Additionally, we evaluate vacancy migration rates and energy barriers in an imperfect crystal using direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the string method. Notably, vacancy configurations were absent from the training data. Our results demonstrate the MLFF's capability to capture essential solid-state properties with good agreement to reference data, even for unseen configurations. We further discuss data engineering strategies to enhance the generalizability of MLFFs. The proposed set of benchmark tests and workflow for evaluating MLFF performance in describing perfect and imperfect crystals pave the way for reliable application of MLFFs in studying complex solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>eminus -- Pythonic electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.</description>
