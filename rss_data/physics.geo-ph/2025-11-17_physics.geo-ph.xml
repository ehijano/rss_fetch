      <title>Seismic quiescence and activation prior to the 2025 M8.8 Kamchatka, Russia earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 29 July 2025 Kamchatka earthquake, of magnitude M8.8, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the preparatory processes of a great subduction event. Despite Kamchatka's high seismic activity, the long-term evolution of seismicity preceding major ruptures has been poorly documented. Identifying temporal patterns-such as multiyear quiescence and short-term activation-is essential for understanding megathrust failure processes. We applied the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model and change-point analysis to earthquakes with M&gt;=5 within a 100-km radius of the 2025 mainshock epicenter, using the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) catalog spanning 1975-2025. This approach quantified temporal variations in the seismicity rate and detected statistically significant change points. We identified a pronounced approximately 20-year quiescent interval beginning around mid-2003, followed by an abrupt activation that commenced with the M7.4 foreshock on 20 July 2025. A similar quiescence-to-activation sequence near the eventual hypocenter was also observed for the 1997 M7.8 Kronotsky and 2006 M8.3 Simushirskoe earthquakes, which ruptured segments immediately north and south of the 2025 rupture, respectively. These results suggest that heightened seismic activity following multiyear quiescence is a recurrent feature of the Kamchatka-Kuril subduction system hosting large megathrust earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Influence of Rotation on Fingering Convection in Planetary Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stably stratified layers are thought to develop at the top of the liquid metallic cores of many terrestrial planets. We consider the case where the thermal gradient is stable but the compositional gradient is unstable, a situation particularly relevant to Mercury. The strong contrast between molecular diffusivities of temperature and composition leads to fingering convection. We investigate this process using hydrodynamical simulations in a rotating spherical shell, systematically varying the stratification strength N relative to the rotation rate $\Omega$. In all regimes, the primary fingering mode forms narrow, elongated structures that shift orientation from the rotation axis to the direction of gravity as $N^2/\Omega^2$ exceeds 10. The fingers remain laminar, with transverse scales proportional to thermal stratification but independent of rotation. Fingering convection also drives secondary large-scale flows across most of the explored parameter space, producing diverse dynamics including zonal flows, hemispherical convection, axisymmetric poloidal bands, finger clusters, and toroidal gyres. In the rapidly-rotating regime, laterally inhomogeneous mixing generates zonal flows in thermo-compositional wind balance; zonal flow direction and amplitude depend on $N^2/\Omega^2$, with amplitude weakening for strong stratification $N^2/\Omega^2&gt;10$. In the intermediate regime ($N^2/\Omega^2\sim 1$), axisymmetric or spiraling poloidal bands emerge within the tangent cylinder, gradually overtaking the primary fingers. For stronger stratification, finger clusters and weak, large-scale density anomalies surrounded by toroidal gyres form in the upper domain. These diverse large-scale flows may interact with the dynamo-generated magnetic field in the deeper core, potentially influencing surface magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Extending the Joint Probability Method to Compound Flooding: Statistical Delineation of Transition Zones and Design Event Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compound flooding from the combined effects of extreme storm surge, rainfall, and river flows poses significant risks to infrastructure and communities -- as demonstrated by hurricanes Isaac and Harvey. Yet, existing methods to quantify compound flood risk lack a unified probabilistic basis. Copula-based models capture the co-occurrence of flood drivers but not the likelihood of the flood response, while coupled hydrodynamic models simulate interactions but lack a probabilistic characterization of compound flood extremes. The Joint Probability Method (JPM), the foundation of coastal surge risk analysis, has never been formally extended to incorporate hydrologic drivers -- leaving a critical gap in quantifying compound flood risk and the statistical structure of compound flood transition zones (CFTZs). Here, we extend the JPM theory to hydrologic processes for quantifying the likelihood of compound flood depths across both tropical and non-tropical storms. This extended methodology incorporates rainfall fields, antecedent soil moisture, and baseflow alongside coastal storm surge, enabling: (1) a statistical description of the flood depth as the response to the joint distribution of hydrologic and coastal drivers, (2) a statistical delineation of the CFTZ based on exceedance probabilities, and (3) a systematic identification of design storms for specified return period flood depths, moving beyond design based solely on driver likelihoods. We demonstrate this method around Lake Maurepas, Louisiana. Results show a CFTZ more than double the area of prior event-specific delineations, with compound interactions increasing flood depths by up to 2.25 feet. This extended JPM provides a probabilistic foundation for compound flood risk assessment and planning.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>
