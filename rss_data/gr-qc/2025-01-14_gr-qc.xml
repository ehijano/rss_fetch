      <title>Maximum Likelihood Detection of Instrumental Glitches in LISA TDI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbiting LISA instrument is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz band, produced by sources including galactic binaries and extreme mass ratio inspirals, among others. The detector consists of three spacecraft, each carrying a pair of free-falling test masses. A technology-demonstration mission, LISA Pathfinder, was launched in 2015, and observed several sudden changes in test mass acceleration, referred to as "glitches." Similar glitches in the full LISA mission have the potential to contaminate the Time-Delay Interferometry outputs that are the detector's primary data product. In this paper, we describe an optimization technique using maximum likelihood estimation for detecting and removing glitches with a known waveform.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills field modified RN black hole and the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the singularity problem in black hole physics, Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture . However, whether this conjecture holds in different types of black holes, especially for the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (SCCC), remains an issue worth further exploration. This study investigates the Yang-Mills field modified RN black hole, which provides new possibilities for exploring the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture due to its unique nonlinear dynamical properties. In this work, the perturbation equations of two scalar fields for the Yang-Mills field modified RN black hole are derived. By combining the WKB method and the Prony method, the quasi-normal modes frequencies of the perturbations are analyzed. Additionally, constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the charged and massive scalar field are obtained using the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), and it is shown that the Yang-Mills field modified RN black hole satisfies the SCCC conditions in the extreme state. The study reveals that the Yang-Mills field charge $q_{YM}$ significantly affects the damping effect and gravitational blueshift effect of the perturbations, causing the RN black hole in the extreme state to transition from violating the SCCC to satisfying it. Furthermore, when the charge-to-mass ratio $q/m$ of the charged and massive scalar field satisfies the WGC condition, the scalar field perturbations destabilize the Cauchy horizon of the Yang-Mills field modified RN black hole in the extreme state, thus confirming the applicability of the SCCC under extreme conditions. This study highlights the key role of nonlinear fields in singularity theory and gravitational dynamics, providing important support for the completeness of general relativity and offering new insights into the theoretical research of black holes in extreme states.</description>

      <title>On Legacy of Starobinsky Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was outstanding theoretical physicist who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology, based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his greatest achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Gravities and Equivalence Principle: Foundations and experimental implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity includes General Relativity (GR), based on spacetime curvature; the Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (TEGR), which relies on spacetime torsion; and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (STEGR), grounded in nonmetricity. Recent studies demonstrate that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are dynamically equivalent, raising questions about the fundamental structure of spacetime, the under-determination of these theories, and whether empirical distinctions among them are possible. The aim of this work is to show that they are equivalent in many features but not exactly in everything. In particular, their relationship with the Equivalence Principle (EP) is different. The EP is a deeply theory-laden assumption, which is assumed as fundamental in constructing GR, with significant implications for our understanding of spacetime. However, it introduces unresolved conceptual issues, including its impact on the nature of the metric and connection, its meaning at the quantum level, tensions with other fundamental interactions and new physics, and its role in dark matter and dark energy problems. In contrast, TEGR and STEGR recover the EP but do not rely on it as a foundational principle. The fact that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are equivalent in non-trivial predictions, but the EP is not necessary for TEGR and STEGR, suggests that it may not be a fundamental feature but an emergent one, potentially marking differences in the empirical content of the three theories. Thus, the developments within the Geometric Trinity framework challenge traditional assumptions about spacetime and may help to better understand some of the unresolved foundational difficulties related to the EP.</description>

      <title>What Hawking Radiation Looks Like as You Fall into a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the measurements of a freely-falling Unruh-DeWitt particle detector near the horizon of a semi-classical Schwarzschild black hole. Our results show that the detector's response increases smoothly as it approaches and crosses the horizon in both the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh vacua. However, these measurements are dominated by the effects of switching the detector on and off, rather than by the detection of Hawking radiation particles. We demonstrate that a freely-falling Unruh-DeWitt detector cannot directly measure Hawking radiation near the horizon because the time required for thermalization is longer than the time spent near the horizon. We propose an operational definition of the effective temperature along an infalling trajectory based on measurements by a particle detector. Using this method, we find that the effective temperature measured by a freely-falling observer in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum increases smoothly from the Hawking temperature far from the horizon to twice the Hawking temperature at the horizon, and continues to rise into the interior of the black hole. This effective temperature closely matches an analytical prediction derived by embedding Schwarzschild spacetime into a higher-dimensional Minkowski space, suggesting that further exploration of higher-dimensional embeddings could provide new insights into the near-horizon behavior of black holes.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Perturbed $f(R)$ Gravity and Perturbed Rastall Gravity Models in Describing Cosmic Evolution from Early to Late Universe Relative to the $\Lambda$CDM Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducts a meticulous examination of the cosmological implications inherent in Rastall gravity and $f(R)$ gravity models, assessing their efficacy across distinct cosmic epochs, from early universe structure formation to late-time acceleration. In the initial stages, both models exhibit commendable compatibility with observed features of structure formation, aligning with the established $\Lambda$CDM model. The derived Jeans' wavenumbers for each model support their viability. However, as the cosmic timeline progresses into the late universe, a discernible disparity surfaces. Utilizing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we reconstruct the deceleration parameter $(q)$ and identify Deceleration - Acceleration redshift transition values. For $f(R)$ gravity, our results align closely with previous studies, emphasizing its superior ability to elucidate the recent cosmic acceleration. In contrast, Rastall gravity exhibits distinct redshift transition values. Our rigorous analysis underscores the prowess of $f(R)$ gravity in capturing the observed cosmic acceleration, positioning it as a compelling alternative to the conventional $\Lambda$CDM model. The discernible shifts observed in the peaks of the CMB power spectrum and evolution of deceleration parameter (q) for both $f(R)$ gravity and Rastall gravity models in the Early and Late universe, in relation to the $\Lambda $CDM model, provide compelling evidence supporting the proposition that these alternative gravity models can account for the anisotropy of the universe without invoking the need for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Testing Einstein Maxwell Power-Yang-Mills Hair via Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the optical appearance of static and spherically symmetric hairy black holes is studied under the standard Einstein-Maxwell theory considering the p-power Yang-Mills term. During the research process, the specific case of $p=1/2$ was mainly selected for discussion. To understand the impact of the hairy parameter on black holes, we have studied the event horizon radius $r_{h} $, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$ and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{isco}$ of this hairy black hole. Then, we utilized the backward ray-tracing method to analyze the geodesics of photons around this black hole and discussed the influence of the hairy parameter on the photon geodesics. In addition, we also calculated the unique shadow and photon ring of the black hole irradiated by a static thin accretion disk with three toy model emission functions. The research results show that as the hairy parameter gradually increases, the event horizon radius $r_{h} $, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{isco}$ and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ of the black hole all exhibit a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, it also causes the area of the black hole shadow and the photon ring to decrease accordingly. Consequently, in the case of the static and spherically symmetric standard Einstein Maxwell power-Yang-Mills hairy black hole, there is no degeneracy in the photon ring and the shadow. Theoretically, it can reflect different black hole solutions and thus verify the Yang-Mills hair.</description>

      <title>Constraining the curvature-induced quantum gravity scales via gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters that govern curvature-induced quantum gravity time-of-flight (TOF) effects. These TOF delays, which occur due to modified dispersion relations of particles in a vacuum, could be a phenomenological signature of quantum gravity. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), short, high-energy events from distant galaxies, offer a unique opportunity to impose observational limits on TOF delays and, by extension, on the energy scales of quantum gravity. Using the standard Jacob-Piran relation, which assumes a locally-flat spacetime, the analysis of quantum gravity-induced TOF effects establishes a lower limit of approximately 10 Planck energies on the energy scale of these effects. However, curvature-induced quantum gravity effects may introduce additional contributions. From current GRB observations, we find that, at a 95% credibility level, in the symmetry-deformed scenario, curvature-induced TOF effects may only arise at energies above 0.04 Planck energy. If we consider only curvature-induced effects, this limit is an order of magnitude stronger. Observing more GRBs at different redshifts could improve the constraints on the curvature-induced QG phenomena. However, given the capabilities of current telescopes and the current understanding of GRBs, it is unlikely that these constraints will be significantly extended beyond the present level.</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures beyond Newton: exploring hierarchical three-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical three-body systems offer a compelling framework to explore the subtle interplay between Newtonian and relativistic gravitational effects in astrophysical environments. In this work, we investigate post-Newtonian corrections to the periastron shift within such systems, focusing on the impact of orbital eccentricity and relativistic modifications to the center of mass. Modeling the secondary body's influence as a quadrupolar perturbation, we rigorously compare Newtonian, Schwarzschild, and post-Newtonian quadrupolar contributions to orbital precession. Our analysis demonstrates that Newtonian quadrupolar effects could be observable in the orbit of the S87 star around Sagittarius A* if an intermediate-mass black hole is present. Additionally, post-Newtonian quadrupolar corrections, though subtle, may notably influence the dynamics of small Solar System bodies in the presence of massive companions. These findings provide critical insights into detecting relativistic corrections in astrophysical systems with current high-precision instruments, such as GRAVITY. By bridging classical and relativistic dynamics, this study enhances our understanding of gravitational interactions in multi-body systems and paves the way for testing general relativity in the complex gravitational fields of galactic nuclei and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Shadow of the Scalar Hairy Black Hole with Inverted Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the imaging of a hairy black hole (HBH) in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory, where Einstein gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar potential $V(\phi)=-\Lambda \phi^4 + \mu \phi^2$ with $\Lambda$ and $\mu$ are constants. As a consequence, a nontrivial scalar field at the event horizon $\phi_H$ allows the HBH to evade the no-hair theorem, bifurcate from the Schwarzschild black hole by acquiring some new properties, which can affect the shadow of the HBH received by a distant observer. The framework of ray-tracing is adopted to investigate the optical appearance of the HBH, thus the trajectories of light rays around the HBH can be classified into three emissions: direct, lensed and photon ring. Employing three models of optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, we compare the differences between the Schwarzschild black hole and HBH with same horizon radius in a specific model, and find that the size of the shadow and accretion disk increases as $\phi_H$ increases, but the brightness of the rings remain nearly unaffected, this implies our HBH can potentially mimic the Schwarzschild black hole if we vary the horizon radius of the HBH. Finally, we also constraint the parameter $\Lambda$ from the observations of supermassive black holes in the galactic center of M87 and Sgr A$^{*}$, which could offer new insights for imaging of black holes and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>The I-Love universal relation for polytropic stars under Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moment of inertia and tidal deformability of idealized stars with polytropic equations of state (EOSs) are numerically calculated under both Newtonian gravity and general relativity (GR). The results explicitly confirm that the relation between the moment of inertia and tidal deformability, parameterized by the star's mass, exhibits variations of 1% to 10% for different polytropic indices in Newtonian gravity and GR, respectively. This indicates a more robust I-Love universal relation in the Newtonian framework. The theoretically derived I-Love universal relation for polytropic stars is subsequently tested against observational data for the moment of inertia and tidal deformability of the 8 planets and some moons in our solar system. The analysis reveals that the theoretical I-Love universal relation aligns well with the observational data, suggesting that it can serve as an empirical relation. Consequently, it enables the estimation of either the moment of inertia or the tidal deformability of an exoplanet if one of these quantities, along with the mass of the exoplanet, is known.</description>

      <title>Mass (re)distribution for quantum dust cores of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective ground state for a spherical symmetric dust ball has been investigated recently in [R. Casadio, Phys. Lett. B 843 (2023) 138055]. In this study, we refine that model by obtaining a mass distribution that accounts for the superposition of wavefunctions across different layers. The refined mass distribution shows significant deviations from the approximation without quantum superpositions. Specifically, the new nearly parabolic distribution replaces the linear mass profile of the original work, featuring an overall downward concavity, which leads to a non-vanishing tension. Notably, the regularity of the metric and causal structure are preserved in the refined analysis.</description>

      <title>Assessing the systematic errors of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals waveforms for testing general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are powerful tools for testing general relativity (GR). However, systematic errors arising from waveform models could potentially lead to incorrect scientific conclusions. These errors can be divided into two main categories: fundamental bias (due to limitations in the validity of the Einstein field equations) and modeling error (due to inaccuracies in waveform templates). Using Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of these systematic errors on tests of GR. Regarding fundamental bias, we find that at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), there is a risk of misidentifying a non-GR EMRI signal as a GR-EMRI one, and vice versa. However, this risk diminishes as the SNR increases to around 40 or higher. Additionally, modeling errors might reduce the SNR of detected EMRI signals and could be misinterpreted as deviations from GR, leading Bayesian inference to favor non-GR scenarios, especially at high SNR. We emphasize the importance of developing sufficiently accurate waveform templates based on alternative gravity theories for testing GR.</description>

Abstract: We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime, that unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton, and photon fields. This framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense and employs Dirac's six-cone formalism. Originally introduced by Dirac, the concept of conformal space and the six-cone formalism were used to derive the field equations for spinor and vector fields in $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form. Our framework extends this approach to dS spacetime, unifying the treatment of massless and ``partially massless'' fields with integer spin $s&gt;0$ under conformal symmetry. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Faraday Holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed optical trajectories in Kerr spacetime are engineered to exhibit a marked lack of symmetry. The eccentricity manifests as a holonomy in gravitational Faraday rotation that can be made arbitrarily large by radial translation of the common location of source and receiver. All trajectories are non-equatorial and include a passage through the equatorial plane at the radial turning point, where the trajectory and pseudo-magnetic field are well-aligned. This, combined with path asymmetry, results in a large gravitational Faraday holonomy that lends itself to experimental measurement. Trajectories that start further away from the singularity pass more closely to the ergosphere, thus transiting a more distorted region of spacetime with concomitant amplification of gravitational Coriolis force.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories.</description>

      <title>Exact Dynamical Black Hole Solutions in Five or Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new classes of the dynamical black hole solutions in five or higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory, coupled to a dilaton field, in the presence of arbitrary cosmological constant. The dilaton field interacts non-trivially with the Maxwell field, as well as the cosmological constant, with two arbitrary coupling constants. The solutions are non-stationary, and almost conformally regular everywhere. To construct the solutions, we use the four-dimensional Bianchi type IX geometry, as the base space. We find three different classes of solutions, based on the values of the coupling constants. We notice that our solutions could be asymptotically de-Sitter, anti-de-Sitter or flat. We find the relevant quantities of the solutions, and discuss the properties of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting black holes of algebraic type D with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an extension of our previous work [1] (arXiv:2409.02308), we study a complete family of type D black holes with Kerr-like rotation, NUT twist, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and any value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We relate various metric forms of these spacetimes, namely those found by Plebanski-Demianski (PD), Griffiths-Podolsky (GP), and most recently Astorino (A). By explicit coordinate transformations and proper identification of the physical parameters we show that these representations are locally equivalent, and cover the entire class of type D solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ equations, such that the (non-null) electromagnetic field is aligned with both the (double-degenerate) principal null directions of the Weyl tensor. In particular, we concentrate on the subclass which describes accelerating NUT black holes without the Kerr-like rotation.</description>

      <title>VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is intended to be the premier centimeter-wavelength facility for astronomy and astrophysics, building on the substantial scientific legacies of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The ngVLA would open a new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and continuum emission to milliarcsecond resolution, while delivering unprecedented broad-band continuum imaging and polarimetry of non-thermal emission. The ngVLA would provide a critical electromagnetic complement to a suite of particle detectors and gravitational-wave observatories, as well as space- and ground-based telescopes operating from infrared to gamma-ray wavelengths, hence enabling multi-messenger and multi-band astronomy and astrophysics. Current construction plans call for the ngVLA to leverage some of the physical infrastructure of both the VLA and the VLBA, potentially drawing on overlapping personnel and information infrastructure. Multiple options can be envisioned for a VLA+VLBA to ngVLA transition. In order to assess risks and benefits of possible transition plans, the ngVLA project established the VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Advisory Group (TAG). The primary deliverable from the TAG is a ``VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts'' report (this report) that includes a prioritized list of transition options.</description>

      <title>No-go Theorem for Cosmological Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A no-go theorem for parity-violation in even $D$-dimensional spacetimes invariant under $ISO(d)$ and dilatations (as well as the implications for odd $D$) is derived. For the case of real massless scalar and gravitons (as well as any massless even integer spin-$s$ field) at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the reality of wavefunction coefficients in Fourier space to all orders in perturbation theory (any order in loops) coming from a local, unitary, IR- and UV-finite theory, which start from the initial \CRT-invariant Bunch-Davies state in the infinite past, is proven. From this it is inferred that a parity-odd correlator with any massless scalar fields and even integer spin-$s$ fields vanishes in the presence of any number of interactions of massless fields. The same is true for correlators with an even number of conformally-coupled and massless odd integer spin-$s$ external fields, which is used to derive the cosmological analogue of Furry's theorem. The fundamental implications of \CRT symmetry for theories with chemical potentials, such as Chern-Simons and Axion inflation, is also discussed. Given the recent interest in parity-violation coming from observational claims of parity-violation detection, these results provide clear constraints on parity-violating models of inflation and establish the measurement of any parity-odd correlator as an exceptionally sensitive probe of new physics beyond vanilla inflation.</description>

      <title>The quantum enigma of teleportation near black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enigma surrounding the existence of black holes has recently been substantiated through the groundbreaking work of experimental physicists \cite{genzel2024}. Exploring quantum systems under the gravitational influence of black holes has emerged as a pivotal area of research. Among the frontier works in quantum information processing is the utilization of quantum states as quantum channels. A fundamental quantum information protocol is teleportation, in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share entangled states. In this protocol, the sender, Alice, who holds an unknown qubit, utilizes local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to recreate the qubit at the recipient's (Bob's) end. Notably, during the execution of this protocol, Alice loses the unknown qubit on her side. The teleportation protocol, originally proposed by Bennett et al. \cite{bennett1993}, has been extensively studied with various states and under different physical setups. Researchers have explored both modifications to the protocol itself and the viability of various quantum states as teleportation channels. In this paper, we investigate whether bipartite mixed states derived from two inequivalent classes of tripartite pure states, subjected to the gravitational influence of two different black hole models, can still serve as efficient quantum channels for teleportation. We emphasize the teleportation fidelity of these states, a critical factor for determining their efficacy as quantum channels. Specifically, the fidelity must exceed the classical limit of $\frac{2}{3}$ to be considered effective \cite{pop1994}. We conjecture that, even under the gravitational influence of black holes, the quantum characteristics of the given states are preserved, enabling them to function effectively as quantum channels for teleportation.</description>

      <title>Very Special Relativity in Accelerated Frames: Non-relativistic Effects in Gravitational Spectroscopy of Ultracold Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic systems in uniform gravitational fields within the framework of Very Special Relativity (VSR). We especially focus on the case of gravitational spectroscopy with ultracold neutrons, explored in experiments like \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce}. Calculating the leading ($c^0$) and next-to-leading ($c^{-1}$) order corrections to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian in an accelerated frame, we derive the fermionic perturbed energy spectrum. At leading order, we do not find new non-trivial modifications, apart from a mass shift, confirming both the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass and particle-antiparticle sectors. The next-to-leading order, instead, introduces time-dependent anisotropic contributions depending on the preferred spatial direction from VSR, which can then be used to probe novel Lorentz-violating signatures. Using \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce} sensitivity as a benchmark, we suggest a first rough constraint for these effects. Finally, we propose alternative spin-flipping setups to better probe VSR signatures and foresee potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Barrow Interacting holographic dark energy cosmology with Hubble horizon as IR cutoff: A model can Alleviating the Hubble and $S_{8}$ Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) and matter clustering (\(S_8\)) tensions within the framework of non-interacting and interacting Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) models. Utilizing a combination of observational datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and lensing data, we assess the degree of tension relative to the Planck 2018 results and recent measurements such as the Riess et al. 2022 (R22) value for \(H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}\) in 68\% C.L and KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 for \(S_8\). Our findings show that both BHDE models mitigate the \(H_0\) and \(S_8\) tensions compared to the standard \(\Lambda\) Cold Dark Matter (\(\Lambda\)CDM) model. The non-interacting BHDE model achieves a moderate reduction in the \(H_0\) tension, while the interacting BHDE model offers a better fit for both parameters, suggesting it is more effective in addressing the tensions. Additionally, the quantum-gravitational deformation parameter \(\Delta\), constrained using the CMB+All dataset, indicates significant quantum effects in both models. The interacting scenario provides tighter constraints on \(\Delta\) and total neutrino mass \(\sum m_{\nu}\), offering a more precise representation of these effects. This study highlights the potential of BHDE models as viable alternatives to the \(\Lambda\)CDM framework for resolving cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Structure and Skewness of the Effective Inspiral Spin Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well-measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$ -- a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary's orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least $12 \% - 17\%$ (at $90\%$ credibility). Our models do not find an excess of non-spinning systems and instead find that at least $\sim 20 \%$ of the binaries have some degree of negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$. The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of the Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the observational images of a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole, wherein a thin accretion disk, serving as the sole background light source, is situated on the equatorial plane of the black hole. The inner boundary of the thin accretion disk extends to the event horizon, and the accretion material in the disk exhibits two different motion behaviors, that is, it moves along the critical plunging orbit inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and follows the Keplerian orbit outside the ISCO. The shadow image is captured on the imaging plane of a zero angular momentum observer utilizing advanced fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques. The results demonstrate that an image consistently reveals a dark region encircled by a narrow photon ring, which is called the inner shadow. At low observation inclination angles, the observation intensity is highly concentrated, with the lensed image of accretion disk being superimposed on the direct image. As observation inclination angle increases, the direct and lensed images gradually separate, becoming distinctly distinguishable and forming a hat-like structure. Furthermore, variations in the parameter space and observation angle will influence pertinent image characteristics, including image symmetry, the range or deformation degree of the inner shadow. We further examined the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Subsequently, we also examined the redshift distribution on the disk. The findings indicate that while variations in relevant parameters do influence the redshift distribution, the primary factor is the change in observational inclination. The observer can detect both redshift and blueshift phenomena on the screen when viewed at a higher observation angle.</description>

      <title>State-space algorithm for detecting the nanohertz gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA). Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data, in which the stochastic gravitational wave strain at Earth is tracked with a non-linear Kalman filter and separated simultaneously from intrinsic, achromatic pulsar spin wandering. The filter is combined with a nested sampler to estimate the parameters of the model, and to calculate a Bayes factor for selecting between models with and without a SGWB. The procedure extends previous state-space formulations of PTA data analysis applied to individually resolvable binary black hole sources. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$, where $A_{\rm gw}$ denotes the standard normalization factor for a power spectral density with power-law exponent $-13/3$. Additional, systematic validation tests are also performed with synthetic data generated independently by adjusting the injected parameters to cover astrophysically plausible ranges. Full posterior distributions are recovered and tested for accuracy. The state-space procedure is memory-light and evaluates the likelihood for a standard-sized PTA dataset in $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ s without optimization on a standard central processing unit.</description>

We fix the corner ambiguities in the boundary action by using the constraint that (exponential of) the on-shell action leads to tree-level 5-point amplitude in eikonal approximation in a generic supertranslated vacuum. The subleading soft graviton theorem follows naturally from the on-shell action when the BMS group is extended to include superrotations. We also show that an infinite tower of soft theorems can be derived from the on-shell action if we consider a 'generalization' of the Geroch tensor by including a set of divergence-free symmetric traceless tensors on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) &gt; 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) &lt; 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent proposal reinterprets the eikonal as the scattering generator, which computes scattering observables through an action as a symmetry generator. The aim of this study is to incorporate dissipative effects from radiation into this framework, where the eikonal is generalised to the radiation eikonal by including mediator field degrees of freedom. The proposed generalisation is tested through several post-Minkowskian scattering observables; scattering waveform, radiated momentum, and (time asymmetric) radiation loss in the impulse.</description>

      <title>Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for computing the afterglow emission. Our procedure is general and applicable to any jet simulation of the same kind.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter halo on transonic accretion flow around a galactic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid, as proposed by Cardoso {\it et al}. We essentially compare the accretion properties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The Cardoso BH is described by the halo mass ($M_{\rm H}$) and its characteristic length scale ($a_0$). Various classes of accretion solution topologies (e.g., O, A, and I-types), including the shock solutions, are obtained by solving the dynamical equations of the flow in a fully general relativistic framework. We find that the accretion solutions are substantially influenced by the halo parameters ($M_{\rm H}, a_0$) when the dark matter distribution is concentrated near the BH horizon. In this context, we also observe that various shock properties, such as the shock radius, flow density compression, and temperature compression across the shock fronts, are potentially affected by the dark halo. Interestingly, the existing shock parameter space, defined by the flow angular momentum and energy, is largely reduced for higher halo compactness compared to that of the Schwarzschild BH. Furthermore, different observational signatures of the accretion disc, like the spectral energy distribution (SED), slope of the SED, and bolometric luminosity, are found to exhibit strong deviations from the known results in the usual Schwarzschild BH model. These unique features offer a possible valuable tool for characterizing the presence or absence of a dark matter halo around a galactic BH.</description>

      <title>Exploring Temperature Influences on Gravitational Wave Production in Binary White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the conditions under which gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted during the merger of hot white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary system. Traditionally, these systems consist of two low-mass stars or a more massive WD paired with a less massive companion. In addition, recent work has investigated the possibility that double white dwarf (DWD) mergers are possibly the leading formation channel of massive, rapidly rotating, high-field magnetic WDs , particularly SDSS J221141.80 + 113604.4 (hereafter J2211+1136) and ZTF J190132.9 + 145808.7 (hereafter J1901 + 14588). Motivated by these findings and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) prospects, this study aims to calculate the tidal Love number, the dimensionless tidal deformability, as well as the frequency and amplitude of GWs of hot WDs. The results indicate that the tidal deformability is more pronounced in stars with higher central temperatures and lower masses, which would lead to reduced emission of GWs. In contrast, more massive stars exhibit less deformability, making them prime candidates for generating stronger GWs. Additionally, the analysis of frequency and amplitude reveals that the frequencies of high-mass binaries are smaller and evolve more rapidly, reaching a limit that aligns with the operational detection capabilities of LISA during its initial phase.</description>

      <title>Testing $\gamma\delta$CDM Model in the Redshift Bins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble crisis is the discrepancy in the values of the Hubble constant inferred from diverse observations in the late and early Universe, being of the order 5$\sigma$. Instead of resolution, the conflict is getting larger with further late-time observations. A fundamental constant should be and remain constant throughout the cosmological history and thus at all redshifts. The fact that it turns out to be a function of redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model points out that either there is a problem with the current cosmological model, indicating unknown new physics, or there are unknown systematics in some of the observations. In this work, we investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble constant in the $\gamma\delta$CDM cosmological model, which is a new cosmological model based on $f(R)$ gravity in an anisotropic background. Through data analysis with the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, the cosmic chronometers Hubble, and both the old and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation data, we establish that the Hubble constant in our model does not evolve with redshift. We also confirm that our model fits the aforementioned data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model by checking various information criteria. The value of the Hubble constant obtained in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model is in the 1$\sigma$ bound of the late Universe observations.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Neutrino Decoupling in Quasi-Metric Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:1701.09151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics in the expanding universe are formulated within the quasi-metric framework. Since the quasi-metric cosmic expansion does not directly influence momenta of material particles, so that the expansion directly cools null particles only (e.g., photons), these laws differ substantially from their counterparts in standard cosmology. In particular, all non-null neutrino mass eigenstates are predicted to have the same energy today as they had just after neutrino decoupling in the early universe. As a result, the predicted relic neutrino background is strongly inconsistent with detection rates measured in solar neutrino detectors (Borexino in particular). Thus quasi-metric cosmology is in violent conflict with experiment unless some exotic property of neutrinos makes the relic neutrino background essentially undetectable (e.g., if all massive neutrino mass eigenstates decay into "invisible" particles over cosmic time scales). But in the absence of experimental confirmation of the necessary exotic neutrino physics needed to resolve said conflict, the current status of quasi-metric relativity has been changed to non-viable.</description>

      <title>Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major science goal of gravitational-wave (GW) observations is to probe the nature of gravity and constrain modifications to General Relativity. An established class of modified gravity theories are scalar-tensor models, which introduce an extra scalar degree of freedom. This affects the internal structure of neutron stars (NSs), as well as their dynamics and GWs in binary systems, where distinct novel features can arise from the appearance of scalar condensates in parts of the parameter space. To improve the robustness of the analyses of such GW events requires advances in modeling internal-structure-dependent phenomena in scalar-tensor theories. We develop an effective description of potentially scalarized NSs on large scales, where information about the interior is encoded in characteristic Love numbers or equivalently tidal deformabilities. We demonstrate that three independent tidal deformabilities are needed to characterize the configurations: a scalar, tensor, and a novel 'mixed' parameter, and develop the general methodology to compute these quantities. We also present case studies for different NS equations of state and scalar properties and provide the mapping between the deformabilities in different frames often used for calculations. Our results have direct applications for future GW tests of gravity and studies of potential degeneracies with other uncertain physics such as the equation of state or presence of dark matter in NS binary systems.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the microscopic behavior of spacetime is critical for developing a theory of quantum gravity and perhaps solving the cosmological constant problem. In this context, it has been proposed that the quantity of interest is the quantum uncertainty in the Ricci scalar and here we investigate this for a discrete baby quantum gravity model based a single square cell. We find that the averaged Ricci scalar vanishes to leading order but has UV-divergent fluctuations. While this behavior is stable under renormalization, it appears not to be under the introduction of a small cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant (CC) and its expected value from quantum field theoretical considerations motivates the search for a theory in which the CC is decoupled from the vacuum energy. In this article, we consider the viability of theories in which the Einstein equations are recovered (without additional constraints) and in which the CC is regarded as an integration constant. These theories include trace-free Einstein gravity, theories constructed from the Codazzi equation (which includes Cotton gravity and a gauge-gravity inspired theory), and conformal Killing gravity. We remark on a recent debate regarding Cotton gravity and find that while the Codazzi equation of that theory is indeed underdetermined, the solutions of the Codazzi equation trivialize to $\lambda g_{ab}$ on generic backgrounds, and that in principle, one can close the system with the divergence-free condition and an appropriate choice of initial data. We also propose a full variational principle (full in the sense that variations in all variables are considered) for each of the aforementioned theories that can incorporate the matter sector; in this manner, we can obtain the trace-free Einstein equations without a unimodular constraint. The resulting actions require additional (auxiliary) fields and are therefore only expected to be effective, but they may provide a useful starting point in bottom up approaches to constructing more fundamental theories.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the internal dynamics of hairy black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-vector theory. The development of the charged vector hair necessarily removes the inner Cauchy horizon and results in an anisotropic black hole ending at a spacelike singularity. The far interior evolution is characterized by the chaotic alternations among different Kasner epochs. We show that those late interior time dynamics of bounces and epochs can be captured analytically. In particular, we obtain three distinct types of transformation laws for the alternation of Kasner epochs analytically, including the Kasner inversion, Kasner transition, and Kasner reflection. Our analytical approach is corroborated by numerical solutions to the full equations of motion. Moreover, we provide a clear explanation of the alternation of Kasner epochs found numerically in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We study supertranslations at spatial and future timelike infinity in the first-order formalism. We relax the Ashtekar-Engle-Sloan boundary conditions to allow supertranslations at the spatial infinity and obtain the precise form of the tetrads and Lorentz connections. Employing the covariant phase space technique we obtain the Hamiltonian charges for the supertranslations at both timelike and spatial infinities. The charges obtained are shown to match the expressions reported adopting the metric-based approach.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Maxwell-scalar models on radially symmetric spacetimes in which the gauge and scalar fields are coupled via the electric permittivity. We find the conditions that allow for the presence of minimum energy configurations. In this formalism, the charge density must be written exclusively in terms of the components of the metric tensor and the scalar field is governed by first-order equations. We also find a manner to map the aforementioned equation into the corresponding one associated to kinks in $(1,1)$ spacetime dimensions, so we get analytical solutions for three specific spacetimes. We then calculate the energy density and show that the energy is finite. The stability of the solutions against contractions and dilations, following Derrick's argument, and around small fluctuations in the fields is also investigated. In this direction, we show that the solutions obeying the first-order framework are stable.</description>

Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a nonlinear electromagnetic extension in AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational properties of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of an AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Our study begins with an analysis of the metric function and horizon structure, followed by calculations of the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars and an evaluation of the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols. These calculations allow us to examine geodesics and their influence on the photon sphere, and shadow formation. In the thermodynamic framework, we evaluate essential quantities, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, Gibbs free energy, and Hawking radiation emission. We further investigate black hole evaporation by estimating the evaporation timescale as the black hole approaches its final state. Additionally, quasinormal modes for scalar and vector perturbations are computed using the WKB approximation to characterize oscillatory behavior of the system. Finally, a time-domain analysis is provided in order to examine the evolution of these perturbations.</description>

      <title>New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the so-called Palatini formulation of General Relativity and of its modifications and extensions, we consider an analogous formulation of the dynamics of a self-interacting gauge field which is determined by non-linear extension of Maxwell's theory, usually known as nonlinear electrodynamics. In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated, a priori as independent, and, as such, varied independently in order to produce the field equations. Accordingly we consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity and for the self-gravitating case with emphasis on black holes. As a background for comparison between the first and second order formalisms, some of the solutions are obtained by the conventional second order formalism, while for others a first order formalism is applied. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge although their black hole counterparts are not regular.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for generating and analyzing black hole images based on the analytical equations of lightlike geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytical orbit equation of the lightlike geodesics through any fixed spatial point in Schwarzschild spacetime is explicitly presented in terms of the impact parameter, and with the result, the algorithms for generating and analyzing the black hole images under various accretion models are constructed. For the static and infalling spherical shell models of optically thin accretion, the integrated intensity observed by a distant observer is derived based on the backward ray tracing method. By taking the monochromatic emission pattern with a $1/r^{2}$ radial profile as example, the black hole images for the spherical shell with different boundaries are plotted, and then, the geometrical features and luminosity variations of these images are summarized. A notable feature of the black hole images for the infalling spherical shell model is that when the inner boundary of the spherical shell is sufficiently large, the doppler effects can strengthen the luminosity in the small adjacent region outside the shadow. The circular annulus models of optically and geometrically thin accretion are further explored. For a lightlike geodesic, the transfer functions establishing the connection between the emitting and receiving points are first provided in the algebraic manner, and the redshift factors in the static, infalling, and rotating circular annulus models are then deduced. With these results, in the three models, the integrated intensities observed by a distant observer viewing the circular annulus at an inclination angle are derived, and the corresponding black hole images for each emission pattern furnished in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{100} (2019) 024018 are plotted. Finally, the geometrical features and the luminosity variations of these images are also summarized.</description>

      <title>Geometrization 3.0: the black hole shadow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been three geometrizations in history. The first one is historically due to the Pythagorean school and Plato, the second one comes from Galileo, Kepler, Descartes and Newton, and the third geometrization of nature begins with Einstein's general relativity. Here the term geometrization of nature means the conception according to which nature (with its different meanings) is largely described by using geometry. In this article, I focus on the third geometrization, in which the black hole shadow phenomenon relates shape to dynamics. As a consequence, spacetime symmetry could play the role of the formal cause in black hole physics.</description>

      <title>New Rotating Black Hole Solutions With Imperfect Fluid Energy-Momentum Tensor In $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a new class of exact solutions for rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity in presence of imperfect fluid. We find that the exact solutions are holographically dual to a hidden conformal field theory. Moreover we consider another class of exact solutions for rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity, which is obtained through a Lorentz boost transformation on a static spherical symmetry solutions in $f(R)$ gravity. We also find that the boosted exact solutions are holographically dual to a hidden conformal field theory. Comparing the CFT temperatures and the mode numbers of the two CFTs, we suggest a conjecture that, "Two identical rotating black holes (the same mass and the horizon) in $f(R)$ theory could be distinguished by looking at their dual CFT temperatures, and the dual CFT mode numbers. The rotating black hole in the presence of matter has higher CFT temperatures and higher CFT mode numbers, compared to the vacuum boosted rotating black hole".</description>

      <title>Cavity as Radio Telescope for Galactic Dark Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, as a minimal extension of the Standard Model through an additional Abelian gauge group, may propagate relativistically across the galaxy, originating from dark matter decay or annihilation, thereby contributing to a galactic dark photon background. The generation of dark photons typically favors certain polarization modes, which are dependent on the interactions between dark matter and dark photons. We introduce a framework in which a resonant cavity is utilized to detect and differentiate these polarizations, leveraging the daily variation in expected signals due to the anisotropic distribution of dark photons and the rotation of the Earth. We conduct an experimental search using superconducting radio-frequency cavities, noted for their exceptionally high quality factors, proving them to be effective telescopes for observing galactic dark photons. This approach establishes the most stringent limits yet on the kinetic mixing coefficient between dark photons and electromagnetic photons, thereby unveiling a novel avenue for the indirect search for dark matter via multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Perturbed $f(R)$ gravity coupled with neutrinos: exploring cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough examination of cosmological parameters within the context of $f(R)$ gravity coupled with neutrinos, leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Pantheon supernova data. Our analysis unveils compelling constraints on pivotal parameters such as the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the interaction strength parameter ($\Gamma$), sound speed ($c_s$), Jean's wavenumbers ($k_J$), redshift of non-relativistic matter ($z_{\rm nr}$), and the redshift of the Deceleration-Acceleration phase transition ($z_{\rm DA}$). The incorporation of neutrinos within the $f(R)$ gravity framework emerges as a key factor significantly influencing cosmic evolution, intricately shaping the formation of large-scale structures and the dynamics of cosmic expansion. Additionally, a detailed analysis of bulk flow direction and amplitude across various redshifts provides valuable insights into the nature of large-scale structures. A notable aspect of our model is the nuanced integration of $f(R)$ gravity theory with neutrinos, representing a distinctive approach to unraveling cosmological phenomena. This framework, unlike previous models, explicitly considers the impact of neutrinos on gravitational interactions, the formation of large-scale structures, and the overarching dynamics of cosmic expansion within the $f(R)$ gravity paradigm. Furthermore, our study addresses the Hubble tension problem by comparing $H_0$ measurements within our model, offering a potential avenue for reconciling discrepancies. Our findings not only align with existing research but also contribute novel perspectives to our understanding of dark energy, gravitational interactions, and the intricate challenges posed by the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of coupled scalar fields often necessitates simulations on a 3D mesh. These simulations can be computationally expensive if a large scale separation is involved. A common solution is adaptive mesh refinement which, however, greatly increases a simulation's complexity. In this work, we present sledgehamr, an AMReX-based code package to make the simulation of coupled scalar fields on an adaptive mesh more accessible. Compatible with both GPU and CPU clusters, sledgehamr offers a flexible and customizable framework. While the code had been primarily developed to evolve axion string networks, this framework enables various other applications, such as the study of gravitational waves sourced by the dynamics of scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology for analysing the relation between the energy density in gravitational waves and primordial power spectra is developed. Focusing on scalar-induced gravitational radiation, this methodology is applied to a number of scenarios for the primordial black hole formation. Being differed from conventional Bayesian approaches, its advantages include directness and computational efficiency, which are crucial for handling the complex data characteristic of gravitational wave research. As an important application, it is demonstrated that this methodology allows for the systematic reconstruction of power spectra across all scenarios using current pulsar timing array data, providing a clear example of its potential in gravitational wave analysis.</description>

      <title>One loop effective actions in Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss the exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions by providing a proof of the DHS formula and explicitly computing it for new relevant cases. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shear elasticity and the shear viscosity in a simple holographic axion model with broken translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in space via the perturbation computation. We find that, in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the broken translations and anisotropy both enhance the shear elasticity of the system. While in all cases, the broken symmetries introduce a double suppression on the shear viscosity, which is in contrast to the result from the study of the p-wave holographic superfluid where the shear viscosity is enhanced when the rotational symmetry is broken spontaneously.</description>

      <title>A Note on Kinematic Flow and Differential Equations for Two-Site One-Loop Graph in FRW Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the canonical differential equations dictate the behavior of cosmological wavefunction coefficients for two-site loop-level configurations in conformally-coupled scalar field theory within a general power-law FRW cosmology. Employing the tools of relative twisted cohomology and integration-by-parts techniques, we systematically derive these equations, thereby establishing a comprehensive framework for loop-level correlators for the first time. A novel contribution of this work is the extension of kinematic flow framework to the loop-level scenarios. Using a graphical approach based on family trees generated by marked tubing graphs, we efficiently construct the differential equations while capturing the singularity structure and hierarchical relationships within the associated integral families. Furthermore, we present new insights into the tadpole systems, uncovering that their integral families can exhibit multiple parent functions due to distinct, non-overlapping relative hyperplanes, in contrast with the single parent function of bubble and tree-level systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that tadpole wavefunction coefficients selectively probe only a subset of the cohomology space, despite the hyperplane arrangement suggesting a higher-dimensional structure. Beyond these findings, we provide a preliminary discussion on generalization to two-site higher-loop configurations, laying the groundwork for future exploration of more intricate scenarios. This work introduces several first-time methodologies and results, advancing our understanding of the geometric, topological, and dynamical properties of loop-level wavefunction coefficients and offering new insights for probing the fundamental mechanisms of the early universe.</description>

      <title>A study on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario through quadrics of kinetic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed description of the asymptotic behaviour in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario is presented through a simple geometric picture illustrating the geometry of their ordinary differential equations (ODE), which describe a neighbourhood of the cosmic singularity. The Lagrangian version of the dynamics governed by these equations is described in terms of trajectories inside a conical subset of the corresponding space of the generalised velocities. The calculations confirm that the initial conditions of decreasing volume inevitably result in eventual total collapse, while oscillations along paths reflecting from a hyperboloid, similar to those predicted by Kasner's solutions, occur on the way. The exact solution, found in our previous work, proves to be the only one that shrinks to a point along a differentiable path. Therefore, its instability means that the collapse is always chaotic. It is also shown that the BKL equations are not satisfied by the Kasner solutions exactly, even in the asymptotic regime, although the precision of their approximation may be high.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Cosmological Inference with SDSS-IV eBOSS: Simultaneous Probing for Background and Perturbed Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we explore certain subtle features imprinted in data from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) as a combined probe for the background and perturbed Universe. We reconstruct the baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) observables as functions of redshift, using measurements from SDSS alone. We apply the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework to model the interdependencies of cosmological observables $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$, and track their evolution across different redshifts. Subsequently, we obtain constrained three-dimensional phase space containing $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts probed by the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Furthermore, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we obtain constraints on model parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $H_{0}r_{d}$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $S_{8}$ at each redshift probed by SDSS-IV eBOSS. This indicates redshift-dependent trends in $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting a possible inconsistency in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Ours is a template for model-independent extraction of information for both background and perturbed Universe using a single galaxy survey taking into account all the existing correlations between background and perturbed observables and this can be easily extended to future DESI-3YR as well as Euclid results.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>
