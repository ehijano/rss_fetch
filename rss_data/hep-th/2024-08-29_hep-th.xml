      <title>Fermionic entanglement in the presence of background electric and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the fermionic Schwinger effect in the presence of a constant magnetic field within $(1+3)-$dimensional Minkowski spacetime, considering both constant and pulsed electric fields. We analyze the correlations between Schwinger pairs for the vacuum and maximally entangled states of two fermionic fields. The correlations are quantified using entanglement entropy and Bell's inequality violation for the vacuum state, while Bell's inequality violation and mutual information are used for the maximally entangled state. One can observe the variation of the entanglement produced for fermionic modes with respect to different parameters. Additionally, we discuss the key differences from the behaviour of scalar fields in this context. This study offers deeper insights into quantum field theory and the dynamics of entanglement in the fermionic Schwinger effect.</description>

      <title>A note on defect stability in $d=4-\varepsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the space of scalar line, surface and interface defect field theories in $d=4-\varepsilon$ by examining their stability properties under generic deformations. Examples are known of multiple stable line defect Conformal Field Theories (dCFTs) existing simultaneously, unlike the case of normal multiscalar field theories where a theorem by Michel guarantees that the stable fixed point is the unique global minimum of a so-called $A$-function. We prove that a suitable modification of Michel's theorem survives for line defect theories, with fixed points locally rather than globally minimizing an $A$-function along a specified surface in coupling space and provide a novel classification of the fixed points in the hypertetrahedral line defect model. For surface defects Michel's theorem survives almost untouched, and we explore bulk models for which the symmetry preserving defect is the unique stable point. In the case of interface theories, we prove that for any critical bulk model there can exist no fixed points stable under generic deformations for $N\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Conformal Four-Point Integrals: Recursive Structure, Toda Equations and Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider conformal four-point Feynman integrals to investigate how much of their mathematical structure in two spacetime dimensions carries over to higher dimensions. In particular, we discuss recursions in the loop order and spacetime dimension. This results e.g. in new expressions for conformal ladder integrals with generic propagator powers in all even dimensions and allows us to lift results on 2d Feynman integrals with underlying Calabi-Yau geometry to higher dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Basso-Dixon generalizations of these integrals obey different variants of the Toda equations of motion, thus establishing a connection to classical integrability and the family of so-called tau-functions. We then show that all of these integrals can be written in a double copy form that combines holomorphic and anti-holomorphic building blocks. Here integrals in higher dimensions are constructed from an intersection pairing of two-dimensional "periods" together with their derivatives. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher-point integrals which provide a richer kinematical setup.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of a quantum Lifshitz black hole in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the mass-gap of a four-dimensional near-extremal Lifshitz black hole that arises as a solution to a low energy effective theory of heterotic string theory. The effective two-dimensional gravitational description retains features of the Lifshitz symmetry, which break the usual $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariance down to $U(1)$. For this effective two-dimensional gravitational description, we derive a one-dimensional Schwarzian-like description, which inherits the $U(1)$ symmetry. The Schwarzian-like description allows us to compute a logarithmic correction to the entropy through a saddle-point approximation of the two-dimensional partition function. This logarithmic correction removes the mass-gap, as expected. Furthermore, the prefactor of the logarithmic term is $\frac{1}{2}$, rather than $\frac{3}{2}$ found for the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariant description, indeed reflecting having fewer symmetries.</description>

      <title>Stability of multibrane models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multibrane 5-dimensional models with a warped extra spatial dimension compactified on an $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold are investigated. The Goldberger-Wise field, with appropriate bulk and brane potentials, is utilized to fix the brane positions. However, not all configurations with fixed brane positions are stable. Stability against small scalar perturbations of the metric and the Goldberger-Wise field is analyzed in detail. This stability is closely related to the spectrum of radions: namely, the existence of any tachyonic radion indicates instability, while models with positive squared masses for all radions are stable. The necessary and sufficient conditions for each of these possibilities are derived and constitute the main result of this paper. Additionally, some properties of radions, particularly their relation to distances between and along branes, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological string as massive spinning particle in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model is proposed for a classical bosonic string in $d=3$ Minkowski space with an action functional that includes Gauss and mean world-sheet curvature. The Lagrangian is invariant under $3d$ Poincar\'e transformations modulo total divergence. In addition to the diffeomorphism, the action enjoys the extra gauge symmetry with the second derivatives of the scalar gauge parameter. This symmetry gauges out all the local degrees of freedom (DoF's), while some global DoF's survive. The Hamiltonian constrained analysis confirms that the model does not have any local DoF. The world sheet of the string turns out to be a cylinder with time-like axis. The global DoF's of this string describe one single irreducible massive $3d$ particle with spin. The particle momentum is a conserved vector directed along the cylinder axis while the momentum square is a fixed constant determined by the parameters in the action. The total angular momentum is a conserved vector that defines the position of the axis of the cylinder whose specific value is defined by initial data, while the spin, being the product of momentum and angular momentum is fixed by the parameters in the string Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Boundary Bethe ansatz in massless AdS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the boundary algebraic Bethe ansatz for the $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ integrable reflection problem restricted to the massless sector. We derive the double-row monodromy and find the appropriate formulation of the so-called {\it dual} equation of Sklyanin's. We perform the algebraic Bethe ansatz based on Sklyanin's recipe, and obtain the RTT (more properly RTRT) relations, from which the spectrum is obtained by repeated action of the $B$ operator on the pseudovacuum. We obtain the Bethe equations by cancelling the unwanted terms, and provide conjectures for the exact formulas for any number of quantum particles and magnonic excitations.</description>

      <title>R-matrices and Miura operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Miura operators for $W$- and $Y$-algebras from first principles as the expectation value of the intersection between a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory. The expectation value, viewed as the transition amplitude for states in the defect theories forming representations of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation and is thus interpreted as an R-matrix. To achieve this, we identify the representations associated with the line and surface defects by calculating the operator product expansions (OPEs) of local operators on the defects, as conditions that anomalous Feynman diagrams cancel each other. We then evaluate the expectation value of the defect intersection using Feynman diagrams. When the line and surface defects are specified, we demonstrate that the expectation value precisely matches the Miura operators and their products.</description>

      <title>Banana diagrams as functions of geodesic distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of banana diagrams in coordinate representation to the case of curved space-times. If the space is harmonic, the Green functions continue to depend on a single variable -- the geodesic distance. But now this dependence can be somewhat non-trivial. We demonstrate that, like in the flat case, the coordinate differential equations for powers of Green functions can still be expressed as determinants of certain operators. Therefore, not-surprisingly, the coordinate equations remain straightforward -- while their reformulation in terms of momentum integrals and Picard-Fuchs equations can seem problematic. However we show that the Feynman parameter representation can also be generalized, at least for banana diagrams in simple harmonic spaces, so that the Picard-Fuchs equations retain their Euclidean form with just a minor modification. A separate story is the transfer to the case when the Green function essentially depends on several rather than a single argument. In this case, we provide just one example, that the equations are still there, but conceptual issues in the more general case will be discussed elsewhere.</description>

      <title>R-matrices from Feynman Diagrams in 5d Chern-Simons Theory and Twisted M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the analogues of R-matrices that arise in 5d non-commutative topological-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory, which is known to describe twisted M-theory. We first study the intersections of line and surface operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory, which correspond to M2- and M5-branes, respectively. A Feynman diagram computation of the correlation function of this configuration furnishes an expression reminiscent of an R-matrix derivable from 4d Chern-Simons theory. We explain how this object is related to a Miura operator that is known to realize (matrix-extended) $W_{\infty}$-algebras. For 5d Chern-Simons theory with nonabelian gauge group, we then perform a Feynman diagram computation of coproducts for deformed double current algebras and matrix-extended $W_{\infty}$-algebras from fusions of M2-branes, M5-branes, and M2-M5 intersections.</description>

      <title>Geometric interpretation of timelike entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic continuations of holographic entanglement entropy in which the boundary subregion extends along a timelike direction have brought a promise of a novel, time-centric probe of the emergence of spacetime. We propose that the bulk carriers of this holographic timelike entanglement entropy are boundary-anchored extremal surfaces probing analytic continuation of holographic spacetimes into complex coordinates. This proposal not only provides a geometric interpretation of all the known cases obtained by direct analytic continuation of closed-form expressions of holographic entanglement entropy of a strip subregion but crucially also opens a window to study holographic timelike entanglement entropy in full generality. We initialize the investigation of complex extremal surfaces anchored on a timelike strip at the boundary of anti-de Sitter black branes. We find multiple complex extremal surfaces and discuss possible principles singling out the physical contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-shell methods have found a new application to local observables such as asymptotic radiation fields and gravitational waveforms. While these observables are invariant under small gauge transformations, they are known to depend on a choice of asymptotic gauge; in gravity on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes, this is a choice of BMS frame. In this letter, we provide a method for capturing these supertranslations, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the on-shell framework of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang-Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang-Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang-Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov-Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, stabilise the chromo-magnetic vortices and dynamically induce, as non-trivial topological features, chiral symmetry-breaking. The latter is due to the appearance of torsional degrees of freedom, to which four fermion interactions are related, and to the formation of fermion condensates, in which gluon strings get stabilised by non-trivial braiding.</description>

Abstract: ``Deep thermalization'' describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We find a rich set of possibilities. First we focus on the case of a random state of well-defined charge subjected to charge-revealing masurements, and rigorously prove that the projected ensemble approaches a direct sum of Haar ensembles in the charge sectors of the subsystem of interest. We then analytically derive the limiting wavefunction distributions for more general initial states and measurement bases, finding results that include the Haar ensemble, the ``Scrooge ensemble'' (a distortion of the Haar ensemble by a density matrix), and the ``generalized Scrooge ensemble'' (a stochastic mixture of multiple Scrooge ensembles). These represent nontrivial higher-moment generalizations of the Gibbs state, and notably can depend on the entire charge distribution of the initial state, not just its average. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, boundary modes, and the necessity of unnecessary criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We link the presence of "unnecessary" quantum critical surfaces within a single gapped phase of matter to the non-trivial topology of families of gapped Hamiltonians that encircle the critical surface. We study a specific set of one-dimensional spin models where each such family forms a one-parameter loop in a two-dimensional phase diagram. Foliating the non-critical region by such loops identifies "radial" and "angular" coordinates in the phase diagram that respectively parametrize different families and different members of a single family. We show that each one-parameter family is a generalized Thouless charge pump, all with the same topological index, and hence the gapped phase undergoes one or more nontrivial boundary phase transitions as we vary the angular coordinate in a loop through members of one family. Tuning the radial coordinate generates loci of boundary critical points that terminate at endpoints of the bulk unnecessary critical line within the gapped phase. We discuss broader implications of our results and possible extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of the quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we determine the eight form factors of the transversely-projected quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics, in the context of Landau-gauge QCD with two degenerate light dynamical quarks. The study is based on the set of Schwinger-Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.</description>

Abstract: Semiclassical methods are essential in analyzing quantum mechanical systems. Although they generally produce approximate results, relatively rare potentials exist for which these methods are exact. Such intriguing potentials serve as crucial test cases for semiclassical approximations. Recent research has demonstrated a deep connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the exactness of semiclassical methods. Specifically, the mathematical form of conventional shape-invariant potentials guarantees exactness in several related situations. In this manuscript, we review these recent results and discuss their significance.</description>

      <title>Traces of Quantum Gravity Effects at Late time Cosmological Dynamics via Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the entropy-area relation of black hole thermodynamics, we study the thermodynamics of cosmological apparent horizon in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of an Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The adopted EUP naturally admits a minimal measurable momentum (equivalently a maximal measurable length), as an infrared cutoff in the theory. We derive the modified Friedmann equations in this setup and explore some predictions of these equations for the late time universe via distance measures. We show that in this framework it is possible to realize the late time cosmic speed-up and transition to the phantom phase of the equation of state parameter of the effective cosmic fluid without recourse to any dark energy component or modified gravity. Inspection of various distance measures in this framework shows that an EUP with a negative deformation parameter suffices for the interpretation of the late time asymptotically de Sitter universe with standard non-relativistic matter.</description>

      <title>All non-expanding gravitational waves in $D$-dimensional (anti-)de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete, theory-independent classification of $D$-dimensional Kundt spacetimes of Weyl and traceless-Ricci type N. We show that these geometries consist of three invariantly defined subfamilies, namely (generalized) Kundt, pp- and Siklos waves, for each of which we obtain a convenient canonical form. As a byproduct, this also demonstrates that all such metrics belong to the (A)dS-Kerr-Schild class. The role of these spacetimes in Einstein's gravity (including minimally coupled $p$-forms and non-linear electrodynamics) as non-expanding gravitational waves in an (anti)-de Sitter background is discussed. Furthermore, applications to extended theories such as Gauss-Bonnet, Lovelock, quadratic and $f(R)$ gravity are also briefly illustrated, as well as the overlap of the obtained metrics with universal and almost-universal spacetimes. In the appendices we additionally settle the issue of the redundancy of certain field equations for all Kundt spacetimes in a theory-independent way, and present various alternative coordinates for the spacetimes studied in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spin chain models with exotic symmetries that change the length of the spin chain. It is known that the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain at the supersymmetric point $\Delta=-1/2$ possesses such a symmetry: it is given by the supersymmetry generators, which change the length of the chain by one unit. We show that volume changing symmetries exist also in other spin chain models, and that they can be constructed using a special tensor network, which is a simple generalization of a Matrix Product Operator. As examples we consider the folded XXZ model and its perturbations, and also a new hopping model that is defined on constrained Hilbert spaces. We show that the volume changing symmetries are not related to integrability: the symmetries can survive even non-integrable perturbations. We also show that the known supersymmetry generator of the XXZ chain with $\Delta=-1/2$ can also be expressed as a generalized Matrix Product Operator.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Bogoliubov's causal perturbative QFT, which includes only one refinement: the creation-annihilation operators at a point, \emph{i.e.} for a specific momentum, are mathematically interpreted as the Hida operators from the white noise analysis. We leave the rest of the theory completely unchanged. This allows avoiding infrared -- and ultraviolet -- divergences in the transition to the adiabatic limit for interacting fields and elimination of the free parameters of the theory, associated with the choice of normalization in computation of the retarded and advanced parts of causal distributions (corresponding to the freedom in the choice of renormalization scheme). This enhances the predictive power of the theory, and in particular allows to derive non-trivial mass relations. The approach is general and can be applied to investigate any perturbative QFT.</description>

Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>The $g^6$ pressure of hot Yang-Mills theory: Canonical form of the integrand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present major progress towards the determination of the last missing piece for the pressure of a Yang-Mills plasma at high temperatures at order $g^6$ in the strong coupling constant. This order is of key importance due to its role in resolving the long-standing infrared problem of finite-temperature field theory within a dimensionally reduced effective field theory setup. By systematically applying linear transformations of integration variables, or momentum shifts, we resolve equivalences between different representations of Feynman sum-integrals. on the integrand level, transforming those into a canonical form. At the order $g^6$, this results in reducing a sum of O(100000) distinct sum-integrals which are produced from all four-loop vacuum diagrams down to merely 21. Furthermore, we succeed to map 11 of those onto known lower-loop structures. This leaves only 10 genuine 4-loop sum-integrals to be evaluated, thereby bringing the finalization of three decades of theoretical efforts within reach.</description>

Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>1+1d SPT phases with fusion category symmetry: interface modes and non-abelian Thouless pump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: I discuss singular loci in the phase spaces of theories which lack globally well-defined numbers of dynamical modes. This is a topic which appears quite often in the recent literature on modified gravity. In particular, there were discussions about $R^2$ gravity around Minkowski space. It is a relatively simple case, and still there were some confusions. It clearly shows that one should be very accurate when trying to understand a potentially problematic theory through perturbations around a simply looking background. At the same time, many modern teleparallel approaches are laden with even more severe issues. Therefore, it is a topic which is certainly worth carefully thinking about.</description>

Abstract: We study CFTs at finite temperature and derive explicit sum rules for one-point functions of operators by imposing the KMS condition. In the case of a large gap between light and heavy operators, we explicitly compute one-point functions for light operators. Turning to heavy operators we employ Tauberian theorems and compute the asymptotic OPE density for heavy operators, from which we extract the leading terms of the OPE coefficients associated with heavy operators. Furthermore, we approximate and establish bounds for the two-point functions.</description>

      <title>Form factors, spectral and K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation in nonlocal quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the conical region of convergence of exponential and asymptotically polynomial form factors and their integral representations. Then, we calculate the spectral representation of the propagator of nonlocal theories with entire form factors, in particular, of the above type. The spectral density is positive-definite and exhibits the same spectrum as the local theory. We also find that the piece of the propagator corresponding to the time-ordered two-point correlation function admits a generalization of the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation with a standard momentum dependence and a spectral density differing from the local one only in the presence of interactions. These results are in agreement with what already known about the free theory after a field redefinition and about perturbative unitarity of the interacting theory. The spectral and K\"all\'en-Lehmann representations have the same standard local limit, which is recovered smoothly when sending the fundamental length scale $\ell_*$ in the form factor to zero.</description>

      <title>On the inclusion of statistical matter in the non-relativistic limit of NS-NS supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine techniques from kinetic theory and string dualities to couple statistical matter to a non-relativistic (NR) supergravity background, enabling the theory to be formulated in a T-duality invariant form. Similarly to the relativistic case, we explicitly demonstrate that, in the NR limit, the many-strings system necessitates a viscous fluid description for the statistical matter. This is achieved using the generalized energy-momentum tensor of a perfect fluid, which remains covariant under T-duality.</description>

      <title>In-in formalism for the entropy of quantum fields in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to compute the purity and entanglement entropy for quantum fields in a systematic perturbative expansion. To that end, we generalize the in-in formalism to non-unitary dynamics (i.e. accounting for the presence of an environment) and to the calculation of quantum information measures, which are not observables in the usual sense. This allows us to reduce the problem to one involving standard correlation functions, and to organize their computation in a diagrammatic expansion for which we construct the corresponding Feynman rules. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to a cosmological setting inspired by the effective field theory of inflation. We find that at late times, non-linear loop corrections share the same time behavior as the linear contribution, and only yield a slight redressing of the purity. In particular, when the environment is heavy compared to the Hubble scale, the phenomenon of recoherence previously encountered is robust to the class of non-linear extensions considered. Bridging the gap between perturbative quantum field theory and open quantum systems paves the way to a better understanding of renormalization and resummation in open effective field theories. It also enables a more systematic exploration of quantum information properties in field theoretic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new perspective on integrability in theories of gravity. We show how the stationary, axisymmetric sector of General Relativity can be described by the boundary dynamics of a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. This approach shows promise for simplifying solution generating methods in both General Relativity and higher-dimensional supergravity theories. The four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory presented generalises those for flat space integrable models by introducing a space-time dependent branch cut in the spectral plane. We also make contact with twistor space approaches to integrability, showing how the branch cut defects of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory arise from a discrete reduction of six-dimensional Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>New black ring with all independent conserved charges in five-dimensional minimal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution is regular, free from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three years ago, we proposed free off-shell models for ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin multiplets in arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds, constructed conserved conformal higher-spin supercurrents for a massless hypermultiplet, and sketched the Noether procedure to generate its cubic couplings to the superconformal higher-spin multiplets. This paper is devoted to completing the Noether procedure. Specifically, we: (i) describe the unique off-shell primary extensions of the conformal higher-spin supercurrents; (ii) embed the off-shell superconformal prepotentials given in arXiv:2104.10416 into primary unconstrained isotwistor multiplets; and (iii) present the unique gauge transformations of the hypermultiplet and the isotwistor prepotentials. An extension of the Noether procedure beyond the cubic level is also sketched, following the earlier ${\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal approach of arXiv:2208.07783. Our construction is based on making use of the polar hypermultiplet within the projective-superspace setting.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the correlators of three single-trace operators in Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory from the perspective of integrable boundary states. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where two operators being $1/3$-BPS and the entire correlation function is considered within the twisted-translated frame. The correlator can be expressed as the overlap between a boundary state and a Bethe state. It is found that the boundary state formed by the two $1/3$-BPS operators is integrable only when the number of Wick contractions between the non-BPS operator and one of the $1/3$-BPS operators is 0 or 1. We compute the overlaps for the integrable cases utilizing the symmetries preserved by the correlators.</description>

Abstract: Ghosts have been a stumbling block in the development of a UV complete quantum field theory for gravity. We discuss how difficulties associated with ghosts are overcome in the context of 0+1d QFT. Obtaining a probability interpretation is the key issue, and for this we discuss how an appropriate inner product can be constructed to define a sensible Born rule. Ghost theories are intrinsically unitary and perturbatively stable. They can also display nonperburbative stability even when the corresponding normal theory does not. The spectra and propagators are numerically obtained at both weak and strong coupling. Normalizable wave functions are obtained for the energy eigenstates and they show a violation of normal parity. We discuss connections to PT-symmetric quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of holographic steady flows near a first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of steady flows in a holographic first-order phase transition model, extending from the thermodynamics at equilibrium to the real-time dynamics far from equilibrium. Through spinodal decomposition or condensation nuclei, the phase-separated state with non-zero momentum can be achieved. In this scenario, we observe a gap between coexisting phases, arising not only from the variations in energy density, but also from the distinctions in momentum density or longitudinal pressure. These disparities are characterized by flow velocity and latent heat. Furthermore, by introducing an inhomogeneous scalar external source to simulate a fixed obstacle, we reveal the dynamical response of momentum loss in the moving system. Notably, starting from an initial phase-separated state with uniform flow velocity, and subsequently interacting it with an obstacle, we find that the moving high-energy phase exhibits four characteristic dynamical behaviors -- rebounding, pinning, passing, and splitting. These behaviors depend on the velocity of the phase and the strength of the obstacle.</description>

      <title>Non-planar corrections in ABJM theory from quantum M2 branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of semiclassical strings in AdS spacetimes yields predictions for the strong-coupling behaviour of the scaling dimensions of the corresponding operators in the planar limit of the dual gauge theory. Finding non-planar corrections requires computing string loops (corresponding to torus and higher genus surfaces), which is a challenging task. It turns out that in the case of the $U_k(N) \times U_{-k}(N)$ ABJM theory there is an alternative approach: one may semiclassically quantize M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ which are wrapped around the 11d circle of radius $1/k= \lambda/N$. Such M2 branes are the M-theory generalization of the strings in AdS$_4\times $CP$^3$. In this work, we show that by expanding in large M2 brane tension $ T_2 \sim \sqrt{kN} $ for fixed $k$, followed by an expansion in large $k$, we can predict the large $\lambda$ asymptotics of the non-planar corrections to the dimensions of the dual ABJM operators. As a specific example, we consider the M2 brane configuration that generalizes the long folded string with large spin in AdS$_4$, and compute the 1-loop correction to its energy. This calculation allows us to determine non-planar corrections to the universal scaling function or cusp anomalous dimension. We extend our analysis to the semiclassical M2 branes that generalize the "short" and "long" circular strings with two equal angular momenta in CP$^3$. The "short" M2 brane corresponds to a dual operator whose dimension at strong coupling scales as $\Delta \sim \lambda^{1/4} + \dots$, and we derive the leading non-planar correction to it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of the inflationary dynamics are presented here for a single canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We spell out the basic equations governing the inflationary dynamics in terms of cosmic time $t$ and define a set of dimensionless variables convenient for numerical analysis. We then provide a link to our simple numerical Python code on GitHub that can be used to simulate the background dynamics as well as the evolution of linear perturbations during inflation. The code computes both scalar and tensor power spectra for a given inflaton potential $V(\phi)$. We discuss a concrete algorithm to use the code for various purposes, especially for computing the enhanced scalar power spectrum in the context of Primordial Black Holes and scalar-induced Gravitational Waves. We also compare the efficiency of different variables used in the literature to compute the scalar fluctuations. We intend to extend the framework to simulate the dynamics of a number of different quantities, including the computation of scalar-induced second-order tensor power spectrum in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding non-Fermi liquids in dimensions higher than one remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern condensed matter physics. These systems, characterized by an abundance of gapless degrees of freedom and the absence of well-defined quasiparticles, defy conventional analytical frameworks. Inspired by recent work [Delacretaz, Du, Mehta, and Son, Physical Review Research, 4, 033131 (2022)], we present a procedure for bosonizing Fermi surfaces that does not rely on the existence of sharp excitation and is thus directly applicable to non-Fermi liquids. Our method involves parameterizing the generalized fermionic distribution function through a bosonic field that describes frequency-dependent local variations of the chemical potential in momentum space. We propose an effective action that produces the collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation as its equation of motion and can be used for any dimension and Fermi surface of interest. Even at the quadratic order, this action reproduces non-trivial results obtainable only through involved analysis with alternative means. By offering an alternative method directly applicable to studying the low-energy physics of Fermi and non-Fermi liquids, our work potentially stands as an important building block in advancing the comprehension of strange metals and associated phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary Designs have become a vital tool for investigating pseudorandomness since they approximate the statistics of the uniform Haar ensemble. Despite their central role in quantum information, their relation to quantum chaotic evolution and in particular to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) are still largely debated issues. This work provides a bridge between the latter and $k$-designs through Free Probability theory. First, by introducing the more general notion of $k$-freeness, we show that it can be used as an alternative probe to designs. In turn, free probability theory comes with several tools, useful for instance for the calculation of mixed moments or the so-called $k$-fold quantum channels. Our second result is the connection to quantum dynamics. Quantum ergodicity, and correspondingly ETH, apply to a restricted class of physical observables, as already discussed in the literature. In this spirit, we show that unitary evolution with generic Hamiltonians always leads to freeness at sufficiently long times, but only when the operators considered are restricted within the ETH class. Our results provide a direct link between unitary designs, quantum chaos and the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, and shed new light on the universality of late-time quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The symmetron is a dark energy and dark matter candidate that forms topological defects in the late-time universe and holds the promise of resolving some of the cosmological tensions. We performed high-resolution simulations of the dynamical and non-linear (a)symmetron using the recently developed relativistic N-body code asevolution. By extensively testing the temporal and spatial convergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall stability, we determined criteria and physical intuition for the convergence. We applied the resolution criteria to run five high-resolution simulations with 1280^3 grids and a box size of 500 Mpc/h of the (a)symmetron. We considered the behaviour of the scalar field and the domain walls in each scenario. We find the effect on the matter power spectra, the HMFs, and observables computed over the past light cone of an observer, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and non-linear Rees-Sciama effect and the lensing, compared to LCDM. We show local oscillations of the fifth force strength and the formation of planar structures in the density field. The dynamics of the field was visualised in animations with high resolution in time. The simulation code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of ($\mathbf{2+1}$)-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory on Plaquette Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Critical Analysis of Replacing Dark Matter and Dark Energy with a Model of Stochastic Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze consequences of trying to replace dark matter and dark energy with models of stochastic spacetime. In particular, we analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that ``post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has four basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations, and (iv) we also identify some theoretical problems in these models.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-commutative geometry on black hole properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the signatures of a non-commutative black hole solution. Initially, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system, including entropy, heat capacity, and Hawking radiation. For the latter quantity, we employ two distinct methods: surface gravity and the topological approach. Additionally, we examine the emission rate and remnant mass within this context. Remarkably, the lifetime of the black hole, after reaching its final state due to the evaporation process, is expressed analytically up to a grey-body factor. We estimate the lifetime for specific initial and final mass configurations. Also, we analyze the tensorial quasinormal modes using the 6th-order WKB method. Finally, we study the deflection angle, i.e., gravitational lensing, in both the weak and strong deflection limits.</description>

      <title>Charging the Love numbers: Charged scalar response coefficients of Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the electrically-charged massless scalar response to the general Kerr-Newman black hole and obtain the exact (complex) response coefficients, whose real parts are the Love numbers. We find there is a curious discontinuity between the neutral and charged scalar. The Love numbers vanish for the neutral scalar, but are inversely proportional to the electric charge of the scalar in the small charge limit. We study the near-zone of the dynamical equation with non-vanishing frequency $\omega$, and show that the system have an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Love-like symmetry. The symmetry selects a special frequency $\omega_{\rm cr}$, which vanishes in the neutral case, so that the real part of the response coefficient vanishes identically. We also generalize the results into higher dimensions to some extend.</description>
