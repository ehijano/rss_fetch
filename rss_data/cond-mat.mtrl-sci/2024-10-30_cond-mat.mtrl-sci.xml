      <title>Theory of vibrational Stark effect for adsorbates and diatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays the vibrational Stark effect (VSE) of adsorbates at the electrochemical interfaces is generally investigated using the Lambert theory, in which the strong electric field across the interfaces can be treated as some kind of perturbation. Lambert found that the VSE arises mainly from the classical effect, and the quantum effect is negligible. This idea is accepted by almost all current first-principle calculations for this issue. Here we revisit this problem by addressing the fundamental question that to what extent the quantum effect is important for VSE, and if it is observable, then which physical quantity determines this effect. We use the Morse, Lennard-Jones and Dunham potentials as basic potentials to explore this problem using quantum perturbation theory. We define the relative difference between quantum and classical VSE slopes to define the quantum effect, $\eta$, and show that for CO, $\eta \sim $ 2 - 3\%, while for adsorbed hydrogen on Pt electrode, $\eta \sim$ 8 - 10\%, using the experimental data. We find that $\eta$ is determined by the anharmonic coefficient $\chi_e$. Without results we present a new understanding of the VSE as a function of electric field and potential in electrochemical experiments, showing that the nonlinear slope of VSE as a function of potential should arise from the nonlinear relation between electric field and potential across the interfaces, which may resolve the long-standing controversial in experiments.</description>

      <title>Lattice-mismatched and twisted multi-layered materials for efficient solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that alternating-layer structures of lattice mismatched or misaligned (twisted) atomically-thin layers should be expected to be more efficient absorbers of the broad-spectrum of solar radiation than the bulk material of each individual layer. In such mismatched layer-structures the conduction and valence bands of the bulk material, split into multiple minibands separated by minigaps confined to a small-size emerging Brillouin zone due to band-folding. We extended the Shockley-Queisser approach to calculate the photovoltaic efficiency for a band split into minibands of bandwidth $\Delta E$ and mini-gaps $\delta G$ to model the case when such structures are used as solar cells. We find a significant efficiency enhancement due to impact ionization processes, especially in the limit of small but non-zero $\delta G$, and a dramatic increase when fully concentrated sun-light is used.</description>

      <title>Symmetry controlled single spin cycloid switching in multiferroic BiFeO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single variant spin cycloid and associated antiferromagnetic order in multiferroic BiFeO3 can provide a direct and predictable magnetoelectric coupling to ferroelectric order for deterministic switching, and also a key to fundamental understanding of spin transport and magnon-based applications in the system. (111) oriented BiFeO3 supplies an easy magnetic plane for the spin cycloid, but despite previous efforts, achieving deterministic switching of the single spin cycloid over multiple cycles remains challenging due to the presence of multiple spin cycloid domains in the (111) plane. Here we show that anisotropic in-plane strain engineering can stabilize a single antiferromagnetic domain and provide robust, deterministic switching. We grow BiFeO3 on orthorhombic NdGaO3 (011)o [(111)pc] substrates, breaking the spin cycloid degeneracy and by imposing a uniaxial strain in the (111) plane. This stabilization is confirmed through direct imaging with scanning NV microscopy and non-resonant X-ray diffraction. Remarkably, we achieved deterministic and non-volatile 180{\deg} switching of ferroelectric and associated antiferromagnetic domains over 1,000 cycles, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Our findings underscore that anisotropic strain engineering opens up exciting possibilities for (111)pc monodomain BiFeO3 in potential magnetoelectric and emerging magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of Spin Cycloids in a Non-collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern formation in spin systems with continuous-rotational symmetry (CRS) provides a powerful platform to study emergent complex magnetic phases and topological defects in condensed-matter physics. However, its understanding and correlation with unconventional magnetic order along with high-resolution nanoscale imaging is challenging. Here, we employ scanning NV magnetometry to unveil the morphogenesis of spin cycloids at both the local and global scales within a single ferroelectric domain of (111)-oriented BiFeO$_3$ (which is a non-collinear antiferromagnet), resulting in formation of a glassy labyrinthine pattern. We find that the domains of locally oriented cycloids are interconnected by an array of topological defects and exhibit isotropic energy landscape predicted by first-principles calculations. We propose that the CRS of spin-cycloid propagation directions within the (111) drives the formation of the labyrinthine pattern and the associated topological defects such as antiferromagnetic skyrmions. Unexpectedly, reversing the as-grown ferroelectric polarization from [$\bar{1}$$\bar{1}$$\bar{1}$] to [111] induces a magnetic phase transition, destroying the labyrinthine pattern and producing a deterministic non-volatile non cycloidal, uniformly magnetized state. These findings highlight that (111)-oriented BiFeO$_3$ is not only important for studying the fascinating subject of pattern formation but could also be utilized as an ideal platform for integrating novel topological defects in the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>The influence of Ga doping on magnetic properties, magnetocaloric effect, and electronic structure of pseudo-binary GdZn1-xGax (x = 0-0.1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of introducing IIIA-group element Ga in place of IIB-group element Zn in binary intermetallic GdZn on its magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, as well as explicate the modified electronic band structure of the compound. The magnetic transition temperature of the compound decreases with the increase of Ga concentration in GdZn1-xGax (x = 0-0.1) while the crystal structure (CsCl-prototype) and lattice parameters remain unchanged. Our detailed analysis of magnetization and magnetocaloric data conclusively proves that long-ranged magnetic ordering exists in the sample, despite the magnetic interaction considerably weakening with the increase of Ga. The experimental data is rationalized using both theoretical machine learning model and first-principle density functional theory.The electronic band structure of GdZn is manifested with some unusual complex features which gradually diminish with Ga doping and conventional sinusoidal feature of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya- Yosida (RKKY)-type interactions also disappears. A mean-field theory model is developed and can successfully describe the overall magnetocaloric behavior of the GdZn1-xGax series of samples</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Orb, a family of universal interatomic potentials for atomistic modelling of materials. Orb models are 3-6 times faster than existing universal potentials, stable under simulation for a range of out of distribution materials and, upon release, represented a 31% reduction in error over other methods on the Matbench Discovery benchmark. We explore several aspects of foundation model development for materials, with a focus on diffusion pretraining. We evaluate Orb as a model for geometry optimization, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of a photoinduced topological phase transition in Bi-doped (Pb,Sn)Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast photoexcitation offers a novel approach to manipulating quantum materials. One of the long-standing goals in this field is to achieve optical control over topological properties. However, the impact on their electronic structures, which host gapless surface states, has yet to be directly observed. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we visualize the photo-induced evolution of the band structure in Biy(Pb1-xSnx)1-ySe(111) films from topological to trivial insulators. Following near-infrared ultrafast laser excitation, we observe that the topological surface state opens a substantial gap of up to 0.1 eV. Considering the topological phase diagram associated with lattice distortion and atomic displacement, we show that a uniaxial strain generated by the ultrafast optical pulse is sufficiently effective and strong for the observed topological phase transition. Our study highlights the potential of optical tuning of materials through laser excitation to control topological properties on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Phase transformation and water adsorption behavior of ALD deposited and annealed Ru and RuO2 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium metal and its oxide stand out for their exceptional catalytic activity, stability in Oxygen Evolution Reactions (OER) and electrical conductivity, making them indispensable in electronics and electrocatalysis. In this study, atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to synthesize ruthenium thin films, and the subsequent annealing of deposited ruthenium films at different elevated temperatures resulted in a progressive phase transformation from ruthenium metal to ruthenium dioxide (RuO2). The films were systematically characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. XPS was carried out with both soft X-rays from a lab-based instrument and tender X-rays from the synchrotron. The different probing depths of the techniques revealed the gradual transformation of Ru to RuO2 from the top surface as the annealing temperature was increased. The water adsorption behavior of the films was also assessed using ambient pressure XPS (APXPS) at different water vapor pressures. The influence of annealing conditions on the films affinity for water and tendency for water dissociation was analyzed to seek an initial understanding of the surface chemistry relevant to electrochemical water splitting.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Expansion Phase Field Crystal (APFC) Modeling based Efficient Dislocation Simulations using Fourier Pseudospectral Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline defects play a critical role in determining the properties of crystalline solids, underscoring the need for accurate computational methods to study them. Lattice deformation in dislocation simulations, which involves changes in atomic positions, can be described either microscopically by specific atomic configurations or macroscopically by continuum elasticity, each with inherent limitations. The complex amplitude expansion of the phase field crystal (APFC) model provides a mesoscopic approach that bridges these scales. In this paper, we introduce a Fourier pseudospectral method for efficiently solving the APFC model in the context of crystalline defect simulations. This study marks the first application of the Fourier pseudospectral method to the APFC model. The method fully exploits the system's periodicity and facilitates the implementation of periodic boundary conditions, thanks to its high accuracy and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments conducted on two-dimensional triangular lattices and three-dimensional body-centered cubic lattices for edge dislocation geometry optimization have produced strain field images that align well with by continuum elasticity predictions. The findings demonstrate the potential of the APFC model to accurately capture the complex strain fields associated with dislocations at the mesoscopic scales, a key step toward modeling more intricate crystalline defect structures and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Origin of the charge density wave state in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a first-order phase transition associated with charge density wave (CDW) has been observed at low temperatures in intermetallic compound BaFe$_2$Al$_9$. However, this transition is absent in its isostructural sister compound BaCo$_2$Al$_9$. Consequently, an intriguing question arises as to the underlying factors that differentiate BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ from BaCo$_2$Al$_9$ and drive the CDW transition in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$. Here, we set out to address this question by conducting a comparative \emph{ab initio} study of the electronic structures, lattice dynamics, \textcolor{black}{and electron-phonon interactions} of their high-temperature phases. We find that both compounds are dynamically stable with similar phonon dispersions. The electronic structure calculations reveal that both compounds are nonmagnetic metals; however, they exhibit distinct band structures around the Fermi level. In particular, BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ exhibits a higher density of states at the Fermi level with dominant partially filled Fe-$3d$ states and a more intricate Fermi surface. This leads to an electronic instability of BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ toward the CDW transition, which is manifested by the diverged electronic susceptibility at the CDW wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{\rm CDW}$=(0.5, 0, 0.3), observable in both the real and imaginary parts. Conversely, BaCo$_2$Al$_9$ does not display such behavior, aligning well with experimental observations. Although the electron-phonon interactions in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ surpass those in BaCo$_2$Al$_9$ by two orders of magnitude, the strength is relatively weak at the CDW wave vector, suggesting that the CDW in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ is primarily driven by electronic factors.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and stabilization of perovskite phase EuNiO3 thin films through RF sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) that exhibit volatile resistive switching are promising for emulating neuronal oscillators. Charge transfer insulators, such as ReNiO3 (where Re represents rare earth metals like Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu...), form a family of PCMs with tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) temperatures across a broad range. Notably, MIT can be adjusted via chemical doping or strain engineering. EuNiO3, in particular, is an attractive choice for oscillator devices given its bulk transition temperature (TMI) of approximately 190{\deg}C, which is well above room temperature, reducing crosstalk issues while remaining low enough to support energy-efficient applications. We demonstrate a method to stabilize high-quality epitaxial EuNiO3 thin films through scalable reactive RF sputtering and post-annealing, optimizing oxygen partial pressures and annealing temperatures across two substrates. Growth at low or zero oxygen partial pressures resulted in amorphous samples, while higher pressures improved crystallinity but led to the stabilization of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases [An+1BnO3n+1] and associated faults. Post-annealing enhanced crystallinity in all samples, transforming RP phases and faults toward the perovskite phase.
  We conducted operando XRD and transport measurements on our films, finding the transition temperatures of perovskite phase samples grown on LAO and LSAT to be approximately 300{\deg}C and 250{\deg}C, respectively. We attribute the increase in TMI for LAO samples to in-plane compressive strain (-0.76%), which reduces the Ni-O-Ni bond angles in-plane. Similarly, LSAT samples experience in-plane tensile strain (2.1%), which decreases out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles, increasing TMI compared to bulk. However, this is counteracted by oxygen vacancies due to lowered formation energies. Films that stabilized in RP phases did not exhibit any transition.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of excitons in the near ideal performance of perovskite light emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports indicate that perovskite based light emitting diodes (LEDs) have achieved an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32% - rather an internal quantum efficiency close to 100%. Much of this improved performance is attributed to the role of excitons. While the experimental trends are encouraging, the recombination parameters estimated through extensive curve-fitting of photoluminescence (PL) transients are often not amenable to reasonable interpretations. In view of the same, through a detailed analysis of free carrier - exciton dynamics in perovskite optoelectronic materials, here we identify a coherent scheme to unambiguously back extract the relevant parameters. The model predictions compare well with the recent experimental results on perovskite LEDs with record EQE thus quantifying the role of excitons. Importantly, this work identifies a physics aware scheme for the design of experiments tailored towards consistent exploration of underlying physical mechanisms and hence could enable a synergistic optimization of process technology and device performance.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in Bethe-Salpeter, (screened) Hartree-Fock, Hybrid-DFT approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the large class of systems described via a time-dependent self-consistent mean field Hamiltonian including (screened) Hartree-Fock exchange, we demonstrate that any electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The proposed approach encompasses different levels of linear response theory, such as time-dependent DFT with hybrid functionals, time-dipendent Hartree-Fock, and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects, using a tight-binding model including exchange effects in the response. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Polarization boost and ferroelectricity down to one unit cell in layered Carpy-Galy La$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered perovskite-based compounds offer a range of unconventional properties enabled by their naturally anisotropic structure. While most renowned for the superconductivity observed in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases, many of these layered compounds are also ferroelectric and exhibit a sizeable in-plane polarization. Among these, the Carpy-Galy phases (A${_n}$B${_n}$O$_{3n+2}$), characterized by 110-oriented perovskite planes interleaved with additional oxygen layers, have been debated as platforms for hosting not only a robust polarization but also multiferroicity and polar metallicity. However, the challenges associated with the synthesis of ultrathin Carpy-Galy films and understanding the impact of strain on their properties limit their integration into devices. Addressing this issue, our study focuses on La$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, an $n$=4 (A$_2$B$_2$O$_7$) representative of the Carpy-Galy family, exploring its growth and concurrent phase stability on various substrates under different strain conditions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a 3% tensile strain from DyScO$_3$ (100) substrates promotes a controlled layer-by-layer growth mode, while SrTiO$_3$ (110) and LaAlO$_3$-Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$ (110), that exert negligible and compressive strains respectively, require post-deposition annealing to achieve similar results. Using scanning probe microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and polarization switching experiments, we confirm that these films possess exceptional ferroelectric properties, including a polarization of 18 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ - more than three times higher than previously reported - as well as persistence of ferroelectricity down to a single-unit-cell thickness. This study not only advances our understanding of Carpy-Galy phases in thin films but also lays a foundation for their application in advanced ferroelectric device architectures.</description>

      <title>Bi-phasic lithiation/delithiation dynamics in Li-ion batteries: application of the Smoothed Boundary Method in the phase field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An appropriate description of the lithiation/delithiation dynamics in bi-phasic primary cathode particles of Li-ion batteries requires an accurate treatment of the conditions holding at the interface between the particle and the surrounding liquid electrolyte. We propose a phase field model based on the Allen-Cahn approach within which the particle-electrolyte interface is smooth (Smoothed Boundary Method - SBM), in order to simulate arbitrarily shaped particles. Surface terms are added to the evolution equations, and SBM calculations are compared with benchmark simulations for which the boundary conditions are explicitly imposed at the borders of the calculation domain. We find that strengthening factors for the surface terms are needed in order to achieve the desired conditions for the phase and elastic fields, and to correctly reproduce the level of stress within the particle. This reveals crucial in the context of Li-ion batteries for an accurate prediction of the Li insertion/extraction rate and the Li diffusion behavior. We perform also a simulation under potentio-static conditions with a full coupling of the different physical processes at play. It illustrates the applicability of our approach and demonstrates the capabilities of the SBM for a simulation of lithiation/delithiation dynamics with coupled electrochemistry and mechanics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Strain in Hexagonal Manganese Pnictide CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manganese pnictide CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$, with Mn atoms arranged in a puckered honeycomb structure, exhibits narrow-gap antiferromagnetism, and it is currently a promising candidate for the study of complex electronic and magnetic phenomena, such as magnetotransport effects and potential spin spirals under high pressure. In this paper, we perform a detailed research of the magnetic properties of CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$ using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Hubbard U correction and spin-orbit coupling, which accurately describe the magnetic interactions. Our results obtained for a large number of magnetic configurations are accurately captured by a modified Heisenberg model that includes on-site magnetization terms to describe magnetic energy excitations. We further investigate the role of the spin-orbit coupling, and find that the magnetic anisotropy of CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$ shows an easy plane, with the preferred magnetization direction being exchanged between axes in the plane by applying small strain values. This strain-tunable magnetization, driven by the interplay between spin-orbit interactions and lattice distortions, highlights the potential for controlling magnetic states in Mn-pnictides for future applications in spintronic and magnetoelectric devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for insulating ferromagnetism in the honeycomb Hubbard model of semiconductor moir\'e superlattices. The ferromagnetism emerges at critical charge transfer regime, stabilizing the quantum anomalous Hall state without Hund's coupling. We further note the ferromagnetic exchange applies to general charge transfer systems when breaking particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Design and control of three-dimensional topological magnetic fields using interwoven helical nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic nanostructures are an emerging platform capable of creating complex topological magnetic fields. The control of localized nanoscale magnetic fields is seen to be of importance for diverse areas from bio-applications such as drug delivery, nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging, as well as condensed matter physics such as particle trapping, and controlling Majorana fermions for quantum computing. Three-dimensional geometric curvature, confinement and proximity can create tailormade spin textures not possible in two-dimensions. The control of magnetization afforded here can allow the formation of unique and reconfigurable stray field patterns and topologies. Here, we report the creation of reconfigurable 3D topological magnetic field textures induced by a single interwoven 3D nanostructure and an applied field protocol. These field textures emerge due to distinct types of domain walls formed in this structure and lead to the creation of an anti-vortex field, a hexapole cusp and a 3D skyrmion field tube of mixed chirality. Our results therefore show a key step towards the design and control of topological magnetic fields on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Resolving thermal gradients and solidification velocities during laser melting of a refractory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, such as laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), can yield high-value parts with unique geometries and features, substantially reducing costs and enhancing performance. However, the material properties from L-PBF processes are highly sensitive to the laser processing conditions and the resulting dynamic temperature fields around the melt pool. In this study, we develop a methodology to measure thermal gradients, cooling rates, and solidification velocities during solidification of refractory alloy C103 using in situ high-speed infrared (IR) imaging with a high frame rate of approximately 15,000 frames per second (fps). Radiation intensity maps are converted to temperature maps by integrating thermal radiation over the wavelength range of the camera detector while also considering signal attenuation caused by optical parts. Using a simple method that assigns the liquidus temperature to the melt pool boundary identified ex situ, a scaling relationship between temperature and the IR signal was obtained. The spatial temperature gradients (dT/dx), heating/cooling rates (dT/dt), and solidification velocities (R) are resolved with sufficient temporal resolution under various laser processing conditions, and the resulting microstructures are analyzed, revealing epitaxial growth and nucleated grain growth. Thermal data shows that a decreasing temperature gradient and increasing solidification velocity from the edge to the center of the melt pool can induce a transition from epitaxial to equiaxed grain morphology, consistent with the previously reported columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) trend. The methodology presented can reduce the uncertainty and variability in AM and guide microstructure control during AM of metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq 2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case ($n = 1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of the linearity of the spectrum for arbitrary n over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_f$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable moir\'e superlattice potentials in twisted hexagonal boron nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an advanced atomically thin van der Waals interfacial ferroelectricity platform. Nanoscale periodic ferroelectric moir\'e domains with out-of-plane potentials in twisted hBN allow the hosting of remote Coulomb superlattice potentials to adjacent two-dimensional materials for tailoring strongly correlated properties. Therefore, the new strategies for engineering moir\'e length, angle, and potential strength are essential for developing programmable quantum materials and advanced twistronics applications devices. Here, we demonstrate the realization of twisted hBN-based moir\'e superlattice platforms and visualize the moir\'e domains and ferroelectric properties using Kelvin probe force microscopy. Also, we report the KPFM result of regular moir\'e superlattice in the large area. It offers the possibility to reproduce uniform moir\'e structures with precise control piezo stage stacking and heat annealing. We demonstrate the high tunability of twisted hBN moir\'e platforms and achieve cumulative multi-ferroelectric polarization and multi-level domains with multiple angle mismatched interfaces. Additionally, we observe the quasi-1D anisotropic moir\'e domains and show the highest resolution analysis of the local built-in strain between adjacent hBN layers compared to the conventional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate in-situ manipulation of moir\'e superlattice potential strength using femtosecond pulse laser irradiation, which results in the optical phonon-induced atomic displacement at the hBN moir\'e interfaces. Our results pave the way to develop precisely programmable moir\'e superlattice platforms and investigate strongly correlated physics in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$: A topochemically prepared 3$d^7$ honeycomb Kitaev magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic properties of CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ as a Kitaev candidate. CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ was synthesized through a topochemical process, wherein all Na$^+$ ions in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ were replaced with half the amount of Ca$^{2+}$ ions. This substitution brings the CoO$_6$ octahedra closer to an approximate cubic symmetry. CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \sim 13$ K, which is lower than $\sim$ 27 K observed for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. Notably, its magnetic order is suppressed in a relatively low magnetic field of approximately 4 T, indicating that non-Kitaev interactions can be restrained by reducing trigonal distortion. Our findings highlight the potential of CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ as a viable platform for exploring Kitaev quantum spin liquids and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms in Kitaev physics.</description>

      <title>Transferability of the chemical bond-based machine learning model for dipole moment: the GHz to THz dielectric properties of liquid propylene glycol and polypropylene glycol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a first-principles study of the dielectric properties of liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) using a recently developed chemical bond-based machine learning (ML) model for dipole moments [T. Amano et al. Phys. Rev. B 110, 165159 (2024)]. The ML dipole models successfully predict the dipole moment of various liquid configurations in close agreement with DFT calculations and generate $20 \mathrm{ns}$ quantum-accuracy dipole moment trajectories to calculate the dielectric function, when combined with ML potentials. The calculated dielectric function of PG closely matches experimental results. We identified a libration peak at $600\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and an intermolecular mode at $100\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, previously noted experimentally. Furthermore, the models trained on PG2 training data can apply to longer chain PPG not included in the training data. The present research marks the first step toward developing a universal bond-based dipole model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the molecular quantum chemistry community, coupled-cluster (CC) methods are well-recognized for their systematic convergence and reliability. The extension of the theory to extended systems has been comparably recent, so that developments and studies of periodic CC methods for both the ground-state and for excited states are still active fields of research and provide valuable benchmark data when the reliability of density functional approximations is questionable. In this contribution we describe the CC-aims interface between the FHI-aims and the Cc4s software packages. This linkage makes a variety of correlated wave function-based ground-state methods including M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), the random-phase approximation (RPA) and the gold-standard of quantum chemistry CCSD(T) method for both molecular and periodic applications accessible. This contribution discusses these ground-state methods for clusters and molecules, as well as for periodic systems. In particular, we discuss recent advancements and the implementation of the equation-of-motion CC method for the calculation of ionization (IP-EOM-CCSD) and electron attachment (EA-EOM-CCSD) processes. Open questions and routes to solutions are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of superconductivity and sliding polar metal state in HgPSe3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous presence of polarity and metallicity in a material signifies an exotic polar metal state, but such materials are extremely rare, especially in bulk form, due to mutually exclusive nature of the fundamental defining properties. Here, we report experimental findings that HgPSe3 is a robust bulk polar metal at room temperature with a chiral structure stabilized by pressure and, remarkably, this polar metal hosts superconductivity with critical temperature Tc up to 11 K. Theoretical analysis reveals a two-step interlayer sliding-then-compressing mechanism for coexistence of polarity and metallicity in HgPSe3. This work unveils a new paradigm for creating the bulk polar metal state and simultaneous presence of coexisting quantum orders, raising the prospect of discovering novel emergent physics using pressure as a tuning knob.</description>

      <title>Surface data imputation with stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spurious measurements in surface data are common in technical surfaces. Excluding or ignoring these spurious points may lead to incorrect surface characterization if these points inherit features of the surface. Therefore, data imputation must be applied to ensure that the estimated data points at spurious measurements do not strongly deviate from the true surface and its characteristics. Traditional surface data imputation methods rely on simple assumptions and ignore existing knowledge of the surface, yielding in suboptimal estimates. In this paper, we propose using stochastic processes for data imputation. This approach, which originates from surface simulation, allows for the straightforward integration of a priori knowledge. We employ Gaussian processes for surface data imputation with artificially generated missing features. Both the surfaces and the missing features are generated artificially. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method fills the missing values and interpolates data points with better alignment to the measured surface compared to traditional approaches, particularly when surface features are missing.</description>

      <title>SLICES-PLUS: A Crystal Representation Leveraging Spatial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the realm of crystalline materials has witnessed a surge in the development of generative models, predominantly aimed at the inverse design of crystals with tailored physical properties. However, spatial symmetry, which serves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the design process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry, potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and generation have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES. Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical properties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot learning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of computational materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Pomeranchuk instability from electronic correlations in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ kagome metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among many-body instabilities in correlated quantum systems, electronic nematicity, defined by the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry, has emerged as a critical phenomenon, particularly within high-temperature superconductors. Recently, this behavior has been identified in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, a member of the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome family, recognized for its intricate and unconventional quantum phases. Despite accumulating indirect evidence, the fundamental mechanisms driving nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ remain inadequately understood, sparking ongoing debates. In this study, we employ polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal definitive signatures of an orbital-selective nematic deformation in the electronic structure of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. This direct experimental evidence underscores the pivotal role of orbital degrees of freedom in symmetry breaking, providing new insights into the complex electronic environment. By applying the functional renormalization group technique to a fully interacting ab initio model, we demonstrate the emergence of a finite angular momentum ($d$-wave) Pomeranchuk instability in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, driven by the concomitant action of electronic correlations within specific orbital channels and chemical potential detuning away from Van Hove singularities. By elucidating the connection between orbital correlations and symmetry-breaking instabilities, this work lays a crucial foundation for future investigations into the broader role of orbital selectivity in quantum materials, with far-reaching implications for the design and manipulation of novel electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Observation of Anderson localization transitions in a two-dimensional conjugated metal-organic framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization transitions are a universal quantum phenomenon sensitive to the disorder and dimensionality of electronic systems. Over the past decades, this intriguing topic has inspired overwhelmingly more theoretical studies than experimental verifications due to the difficulty of controlling a material's disorder or dimensionality without modifying its fundamental electronic properties. Organic crystals with their rich disorders would be terrific playgrounds to investigate such disorder-driven phase transitions except for their low conductivities which usually prohibit low-temperature measurements. Here, we conduct systematic transport experiments in mesoscopic devices made with copper benzenehexathiol thin films across a wide range of thicknesses. We find metal-insulator transitions both among three-dimensional samples with different disorder strengths and between three-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional samples. Temperature-dependence analysis of the conductivities corroborates the dimensionality crossover. Moreover, our theoretical modeling provides a basis for understanding both types of metal-insulator transitions within the framework of Anderson localization transitions. Our findings establish for the first time that organic crystals such as conductive metal-organic frameworks can exhibit such quantum interference effects. With organic materials' versatile chemical designs and crystalline structures, our work opens new avenues to search for novel quantum phenomena in organic material platforms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic precursor to the structural phase transition in V$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between structural, electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom across the metal-insulator transition in V2O3 makes it hard to determine the main driving mechanism behind the transition. Specifically, the role of magnetism has been debated and its interplay with the other transitions has not been established. To address this issue, we use a combination of muon spin relaxation/rotation, electrical transport and reciprocal space mapping which allows to correlate magnetic, electronic and structural degrees of freedom in strain-engineered V2O3 thin films. Evidence is found for a magnetic instability in the vicinity of the structural transition. This is manifested as a decrease in the antiferromagnetic moment with temperature leading to a virtual N\'eel transition temperature which coincides with that of the structural and electronic transitions. Moreover, we find evidence for an onset of antiferromagnetic (AF) fluctuations in the rhombohedral phase even without a structural transition to the monoclinic phase. The non-congruence of the structural and magnetic transitions increases as the transition temperature is reduced by strain. In samples where the transition is most strongly suppressed by strain, a depth-dependent magnetic state is observed. These results reveal the importance of an AF instability in the paramagnetic phase in triggering the metal-insulator transition and the crucial role of the structural transition in allowing for the formation of an ordered AF state.</description>

      <title>Low-density functionalized amorphous carbon nanofoam as binder-free Supercapacitor electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous carbon materials containing small domains of sp2-carbon with highly disordered structures are promising for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we synthesize amorphous carbon nanofoam with 98% volumetric void fraction and low mass density of around 30 mg/cm3 by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. With the unavoidable oxygen functional groups on the nanoporous surface, pristine and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofoams are directly grown on the desired substrate under background gas of Ar, N2 and N2-H2employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Among the background gases used in synthesis, the use of nitrogen yields nanofoam with higher thickness and more N-content with higher graphitic-N, which is correlated with plasma plume behaviour. From the test of amorphous carbon nanofoam supercapacitor device, nitrogenated amorphous carbon show a higher areal capacitance of 4.1 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s in aqueous electrolyte, a better capacitance retention at higher current, and excellent cycle stability (98%) over prolonged 10000 charge-discharge cycles are achieved for compared to pristine counterpart prepared under Ar background gas (2.7 mF/cm2 and cycle stability of 88%).</description>

      <title>In-situ Study of Understanding the Resistive Switching Mechanisms of Nitride-based Memristor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interface-type resistive switching (RS) devices with lower operation current and more reliable switching repeatability exhibits great potential in the applications for data storage devices and ultra-low-energy computing. However, the working mechanism of such interface-type RS devices are much less studied compared to that of the filament-type devices, which hinders the design and application of the novel interface-type devices. In this work, we fabricate a metal/TiOx/TiN/Si (001) thin film memristor by using a one-step pulsed laser deposition. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and current-voltage (I-V) characteristic demonstrate that the device is switched between high resistive state (HRS) and low resistive state (LRS) in a bipolar fashion with sweeping the applied positive and negative voltages. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveal that the charged defects (such as oxygen vacancies) can migrate along the intrinsic grain boundaries of TiOx insulating phase under electric field without forming obvious conductive filaments, resulting in the modulation of Schottky barriers at the metal/semiconductor interfaces. The fundamental insights gained from this study presents a novel perspective on RS processes and opens up new technological opportunities for fabricating ultra-low-energy nitride-based memristive devices.</description>

      <title>Computing the bridge length: the key ingredient in a continuous isometry classification of periodic point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental model of any periodic crystal is a periodic set of points at all atomic centres. Since crystal structures are determined in a rigid form, their strongest equivalence is rigid motion (composition of translations and rotations) or isometry (also including reflections). The recent isometry classification of periodic point sets used a complete invariant isoset whose size essentially depends on the bridge length, defined as the minimum `jump' that suffices to connect any points in the given set.
  We propose a practical algorithm to compute the bridge length of any periodic point set given by a motif of points in a periodically translated unit cell. The algorithm has been tested on a large crystal dataset and is required for an efficient continuous classification of all periodic crystals. The exact computation of the bridge length is a key step to realising the inverse design of materials from new invariant values.</description>

Abstract: Uniaxially strained Fe--Co disordered alloys have emerged as promising candidates for cost-effective rare-earth-free permanent magnets due to their high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Using first-principles, fully relativistic calculations within the coherent potential approximation and PBE exchange-correlation potential, we explore the MAE of tetragonal Fe--Co alloys under uniaxial compression. Our results reveal a previously uncharted high-MAE region, distinct from known structures and accessible through uniaxial compression.</description>

      <title>Transition from antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism: symmetry breaking theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently proposed magnetic phase, is distinguished by the antiferromagnetic coupling of local magnetic moments and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Currently, the transition from conventional antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism is not well understood. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive symmetry-breaking theory to elucidate this transition. Our approach involves analyzing magnetic point groups and their subgroups to identify potential pathways for the phase transition from collinear antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism. According to our theory, breaking inversion symmetry is crucial for this transition. We discovered that applying an external electric field is a highly effective method to realize altermagnetic phase, as demonstrated by first-principles calculations on the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic material MoTe. Furthermore, we show that the electronic spin polarization and spin-dependent transport can be significantly modulated by the applied vertical electric field. Our study not only sheds light on the magnetic phase transition from antiferromagnetic to altermagnetic materials but also presents a practical approach to control the charge-spin conversion ratio using an vertical electric field.</description>

      <title>Origin of Oxygen Partial Pressure-Dependent Conductivity in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SrTiO3 (STO) displays a broad spectrum of physical properties, including superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and photoconductivity, making it a standout semiconductor material. Despite extensive researches, the oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity in STO has re-mained elusive. This study leverages first-principles calculations, and systematically investigates the intrinsic defect properties of STO. The results reveal that VO, VSr, and TiSr are the dominant intrinsic defects, influencing STO's conductivity under varying O chemical potentials (oxygen partial pressures). Under O-poor condition, VO is the predominant donor, while VSr is the main acceptor. As the oxygen pressure increases, TiSr emerges as a critical donor defect under O-rich condition, significantly affecting conductivity. Additionally, the study elucidates the abnormal phenomenon where VTi, typically an acceptor, exhibits donor-like behavior due to the formation of O-trimer. This work offers a comprehensive understanding of how intrinsic defects tune the Fermi level, thereby altering STO's conductivity from metallic to n-type, and eventually to p-type across different O chemical potentials. These insights resolve the long-standing issue of oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity and explain the observed metallic conductivity in oxygen-deficient STO.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) computational investigation of the luminescence and absorption lineshapes associated with the neutral carbon-oxygen interstitial pair (CiOi) defect in silicon. We obtain the lineshapes of the defect in the dilute limit using a computational methodology that constructs dynamical matrices of supercells containing tens of thousands of atoms, utilizing systems directly accessible through DFT. Both perturbed bulk phonons and localized vibrations contribute to the phonon sideband. We achieve excellent agreement with experimental luminescence data. Our findings further reinforce the attribution of the well-known C-line in silicon to the neutral CiOi complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of the strong-coupling Hubbard model in a kagome lattice ribbon under mechanical tension and half-filling. It is known that in the absence of strain, the lattice symmetry of the system and strong electronic interactions induce magnetic frustration. As uniaxial strain is applied, the ribbon exhibits various configurations with energy oscillations that depend on the direction of the strain axis. The ground states are obtained by density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. We find that the system is characterized by strong antiferromagnetic bonds distributed throughout the lattice in directions and patterns that depend on strain directions and may coexist with easily polarizable sites that are only weakly correlated to their neighbors. We identify frustration and correlation measures that follow the strain and interaction dependence of the system well. These results illustrate that strain-dependent magnetic susceptibility could be explored experimentally to help probe the role of symmetry and interactions in these systems.</description>

      <title>Defect density quantification in monolayer MoS2 using helium atom micro-diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2D materials continue to be pivotal in the advancement of modern devices. Their optoelectronic, mechanical and thermal properties can be finely modulated using a variety of methods, including strain, passivation, doping and defect density. Vacancy-type defect density, as found in the prototypical MoS2, in 2D materials is inherently difficult to measure due to their thickness. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction using a 5 {\mu}m beam size can be used to measure defect density in ~15x20 {\mu}m monolayer MoS2 quickly and easily at low cost compared to standard methods. We find that diffracted helium intensity is inversely proportional to defect density and that the method can be used as a standalone measure of vacancy-type defect density in monolayer MoS2, with the ability to spatially map defect density. We compare our results to photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and stoichiometric beam-line XPS. Furthermore, we provide computational and theoretical evidence that the method is agnostic to sample chemistry and can therefore immediately be applied to the measurement of vacancy-type defect density on the surface of any crystalline material. Our results demonstrate helium atom micro-diffraction as a rapid, low cost and lab-based alternative to often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming beam-line techniques such as XPS, improving accessibility to 2D materials science and device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Why does the $GW$ approximation give accurate quasiparticle energies? The cancellation of vertex corrections quantified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hedin's $GW$ approximation to the electronic self-energy has been impressively successful to calculate quasiparticle energies, such as ionization potentials, electron affinities, or electronic band structures. The success of this fairly simple approximation has been ascribed to the cancellation of the so-called vertex corrections that go beyond $GW$. This claim is mostly based on past calculations using vertex corrections within the crude local-density approximation. Here, we explore a wide variety of non-local vertex corrections in the polarizability and the self-energy, using first-order approximations or infinite summations to all orders. In particular, we use vertices based on statically screened interactions like in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We demonstrate on realistic molecular systems that the two vertices in Hedin's equation essentially compensate. We further show that consistency between the two vertices is crucial to obtain realistic electronic properties. We finally consider increasingly large clusters and extrapolate that our conclusions would hold for extended systems.</description>

      <title>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the phase field. In the presence of non-normality, the spectral analysis of such a matrix when (unknown or uncertain or time-dependent) constitutive parameters vary is generically not decisive to evaluate the material stability. We thus need to look at the pseudospectrum, that is, the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in an {\epsilon}-neighborhood of the matrix of interest. As a case study, we look at quasicrystals and evaluate through spectra and pseudospectra the influence of a microstructural self-action on the material stability. This approach allows us to reliably determine thresholds where stable-unstable transitions in the material behavior occur.</description>
