      <title>A semisimple subcategory of Khovanov's Heisenberg category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of a semisimple replete subcategory of Khovanov's Heisenberg category that retains the isomorphism data of objects for the full category. This leads to a noncommutative tensor-triangular geometric example of a monoidal triangulated category whose Balmer spectrum satisfies the tensor product property but which contains one-sided thick tensor-ideals that are not two-sided, and whose standard support varieties fail to classify one-sided thick tensor-ideals.</description>

      <title>Condensed mathematics through compactological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their 2022 lecture notes on condensed sets, Clausen and Scholze mentioned in a remark that the important subclass of quasiseparated condensed sets is equivalent to the category of so-called compactological spaces defined by Waelbroeck in the 1960s. In this paper we survey the latter category in detail, we give a rigorous proof of Clausen and Scholze's claim, and we establish that condensed sets are a formal categorical completion of Waelbroeck's compactological spaces. The latter answers a question asked by Hanson in 2023 and permits the interpretation of compactological sets as an 'elementary' approach to condensed mathematics.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Enriched Data Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, categories of algebras of endofunctors were shown to be enriched in categories of coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and the extra structure of that enrichment was used to define a generalization of inductive data types. These generalized inductive data types are parametrized by a coalgebra $C$, so we call them $C$-inductive data types; we call the morphisms induced by their universal property $C$-inductive functions. We extend that work by incorporating natural transformations into the theory: given a suitable natural transformation between endofunctors, we show that this induces enriched functors between their categories of algebras which preserve $C$-inductive data types and $C$-inductive functions. Such $C$-inductive data types are often finite versions of the corresponding inductive data type, and we show how our framework can extend classical initial algebra semantics to these types. For instance, we show that our theory naturally produces partially inductive functions on lists, changes in list element types, and tree pruning functions.</description>

      <title>Cofinality via Weighted Colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a refinement of Quillen's Theorem A, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a functor to be cofinal with respect to diagrams valued in a fixed $\infty$-category. We deduce this from a general duality phenomenon for weighted colimits, which is of independent interest. As a sample application, due to Betts and Dan-Cohen, we describe a simplified formula for the free $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-algebra on an $\mathbb{E}_0$-algebra in a stable rational $\infty$-category .</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <title>Left reductive regular semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop an ideal structure theory for the class of left reductive regular semigroups and apply it to several subclasses of popular interest. In these classes we observe that the right ideal structure of the semigroup is `embedded' inside the left ideal one, and so we can construct these semigroups starting with only one object (unlike in other more general cases). To this end, we introduce an upgraded version of Nambooripad's normal category as our building block, which we call a connected category.
  The main theorem of the paper describes a category equivalence between the category of left (and right) reductive regular semigroups and the category of connected categories. Then, we specialise our result to describe constructions of L- (and R-) unipotent semigroups, right (and left) regular bands, inverse semigroups and arbitrary regular monoids. Finally, we provide concrete (and rather simple) descriptions to the connected categories that arise from finite transformation semigroups, linear transformation semigroups (over a finite dimensional vector space) and symmetric inverse monoids.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Banach-bundle germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a continuous bundle $\mathcal{E}\to X$ of Banach/Hilbert spaces or Banach/$C^*$-algebras over a paracompact base space, equivariant for a compact Lie group $\mathbb{U}$ operating on all structures involved. We prove that in all cases homogeneous equivariant subbundles extend equivariantly from $\mathbb{U}$-invariant closed subsets of $X$ to closed invariant neighborhoods thereof (provided the fibers are semisimple in the Banach-algebra variant). This extends a number of results in the literature (due to Fell for non-equivariant local extensibility around a single point for $C^*$-algebras and the author for semisimple Banach algebras). The proofs are based in part on auxiliary results on (a) the extensibility of equivariant compact-Lie-group principal bundles locally around invariant closed subsets of paracompact spaces, as a consequence of equivariant-bundle classifying spaces being absolute neighborhood extensors in the relevant setting and (b) an equivariant-bundle version of Johnson's approximability of almost-multiplicative maps from finite-dimensional semisimple Banach algebras with Banach morphisms.</description>

      <title>Compositional Inference for Bayesian Networks and Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference is a fundamental reasoning technique in probability theory. When applied to a large joint distribution, it involves updating with evidence (conditioning) in one or more components (variables) and computing the outcome in other components. When the joint distribution is represented by a Bayesian network, the network structure may be exploited to proceed in a compositional manner -- with great benefits. However, the main challenge is that updating involves (re)normalisation, making it an operation that interacts badly with other operations.
  String diagrams are becoming popular as a graphical technique for probabilistic (and quantum) reasoning. Conditioning has appeared in string diagrams, in terms of a disintegration, using bent wires and shaded (or dashed) normalisation boxes. It has become clear that such normalisation boxes do satisfy certain compositional rules. This paper takes a decisive step in this development by adding a removal rule to the formalism, for the deletion of shaded boxes. Via this removal rule one can get rid of shaded boxes and terminate an inference argument. This paper illustrates via many (graphical) examples how the resulting compositional inference technique can be used for Bayesian networks, causal reasoning and counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Intervals of torsion pairs and generalized Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} tilting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category with a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$. Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting provides a method to construct a new abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ with a torsion pair associated to $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$, which is exactly the heart of a certain $t$-structure on the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories.</description>
