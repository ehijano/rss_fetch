      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Multiplicity of early B-type supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blue supergiant (BSG) domain contains a large variety of stars whose past and future evolutionary paths are still highly uncertain. Since binary interaction plays a crucial role in the fate of massive stars, investigating the multiplicity among BSGs helps shed light on the fate of such objects. We aim to estimate the binary fraction of a large sample of BSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud within the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey. In total, we selected 262 targets with spectral types B0-B3 and luminosity classes I-II. This work is based on spectroscopic data collected by the GIRAFFE instrument, mounted on the Very Large Telescope, which gathered nine epochs over three months. Our spectroscopic analysis for each target includes the individual and peak-to-peak radial velocity measurements, an investigation of the line profile variability, and a periodogram analysis to search for possible short- and long-period binaries. By applying a 20 km s$^{-1}$ threshold on the peak-to-peak radial velocities above which we would consider the star to be binary, the resulting observed spectroscopic binary fraction for our BSG sample is 23 $\pm$ 3$\%$. In addition, we derived reliable orbital periods for 41 spectroscopic binaries and potential binary candidates, among which there are 17 eclipsing binaries, including 20 SB1 and SB2 systems with periods of less than 10 days. We reported a significant drop in the binary fraction of BSGs with spectral types later than B2 and effective temperatures less than 18 kK, which could indicate the end of the main sequence phase in this temperature regime. We found no metallicity dependence in the binary fraction of BSGs, compared to existing spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>The past, present and future of observations of externally irradiated disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the community studying the effect of ultraviolet radiation environment, predominantly set by OB stars, on protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation. This is important because a significant fraction of planetary systems, potentially including our own, formed in close proximity to OB stars. This is a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of observations across many regions recently obtained or recently scheduled. In this paper, stimulated by a series of workshops on the topic, we take stock of the current and upcoming observations. We discuss how the community can build on this recent success with future observations to make progress in answering the big questions of the field, with the broad goal of disentangling how external photoevaporation contributes to shaping the observed (exo)planet population. Both existing and future instruments offer numerous opportunities to make progress towards this goal.</description>

      <title>Ringworlds and Dyson spheres can be stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his 1856 Adams Prize essay, James Clark Maxwell demonstrated that Saturn's rings cannot be comprised of a uniform rigid body. This is a consequence of the two-body gravitational interaction between a ring and planet resulting in instability. Similarly, it is also known that a so-called Dyson sphere encompassing a single star would be unstable due to Newton's shell theorem. A surprising finding is reported here that both a ring and a sphere (shell) can be stable in the restricted three-body problem. First, if two primary masses are considered in orbit about their common centre of mass, a large, uniform, infinitesimal ring enclosing the smaller of the masses can in principle be stable under certain conditions. Similarly, a Dyson sphere can, be stable, if the sphere encloses the smaller of the two primary masses, again under certain conditions. These findings extend Maxwell's results on the dynamics of rings and have an interesting bearing on so-called Ringworlds and Dyson spheres from fiction. Moreover, the existence of passively stable orbits for such large-scale structures may have implications for so-called techno-signatures in search for extra-terrestrial intelligence studies.</description>

      <title>Formation of Jet-driven Forced Reconnection Region and Associated Plasma Blobs in a Prominence Segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to study the most likely formation of a forced reconnection region and associated plasma blobs, triggered by jet-like structures in a prominence segment. Around 05:44 UT on December 16$^{th}$, 2017, hot jet-like structures lifted from a nearby active region and fell obliquely on one side of the prominence segment with velocities of $\approx$45--65 km s$^{-1}$. These eruptions compressed the boundaries of the prominence and flux rope, forming an elongated reconnection region with inflow velocities of 47--52 km s$^{-1}$ and 36--49 km s$^{-1}$ in the projected plane. A thin, elongated reconnection region was formed, with multiple magnetic plasma blobs propagating bidirectionally at velocities of 91--178 km s$^{-1}$. These dense blobs, associated with ongoing reconnection, may also be linked to the onset of Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. The blobs are attributed to plasmoids, moving at slower speeds (91--178 km s$^{-1}$) due to the high density in the prominence segment. The dimensionless reconnection rate varied from 0.57--0.28, 0.53--0.26, and 0.41--0.20, indicating reconnection rate enhancement and supporting the forced reconnection scenario. After reconnection, the prominence plasma heated to 6 MK, releasing significant thermal energy ($\approx$5.4$\times$10$^{27}$ erg), which drained cool prominence plasma and heated it to coronal temperatures. The ubiquity of jets and outflows in the solar atmosphere makes the aforementioned of reconnection and possible co-existence of K-H instability potentially important for the magnetic energy release and heating in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Testing and Combining Transient Spectral Classification Tools on 4MOST-like Blended Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) expected to provide an influx of transient spectra when it begins observations in early 2026 we consider the potential for real-time classification of these spectra. We investigate three extant spectroscopic transient classifiers: the Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier (DASH), Next Generation SuperFit (NGSF) and SuperNova IDentification (SNID), with a focus on comparing the efficiency and purity of the transient samples they produce. We discuss our method for simulating realistic, 4MOST-like, host-galaxy contaminated spectra and determining quality cuts for each classifier used to ensure pure SN Ia samples while maintaining efficient classification in other transient classes. We investigate the classifiers individually and in combinations. We find that a combination of DASH and NGSF can produce a SN Ia sample with a purity of 99.9% while successfully classifying 70% of SNe Ia. However, it struggles to classify non-SN Ia transients. We investigate photometric cuts to transient magnitude and transient flux fraction, finding that both can be used to improve transient classification efficiencies by 7--25% depending on the transient subclass. Finally, we present an example classification plan for live classification and the predicted purities and efficiencies across five transient classes: Ia, Ibc, II, superluminous and non-supernova transients.</description>

      <title>The bulge globular cluster Terzan 6 as seen from multi-conjugate adaptive optics and HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work consists of the first detailed photometric study of Terzan 6, one of the least known globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. Through the analysis of high angular resolution and multi-wavelength data obtained from adaptive optics corrected and space observations, we built deep, optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams reaching $\approx 4$ magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff. Taking advantage of 4 different epochs of observations, we measured precise relative proper motions for a large sample of stars, from which cluster members have been solidly distinguished from Galactic field interlopers. A non-canonical reddening law (with $R_V=2.85$) and high-resolution differential reddening map, with color excess variations up to $\delta E(B-V) \approx 0.8 $ mag, have been derived in the direction of the system. According to these findings, new values of the extinction and distance modulus have been obtained: respectively, $E(B-V)=2.36\pm0.05$ and $(m-M)_0=14.46 \pm 0.10$ (corresponding to $d=7.8 \pm 0.3$ kpc). We also provide the first determinations of the cluster center and projected density profile from resolved star counts. The center is offset by more than $7$ arcsec to the east from the literature value, and the structural parameters obtained from the King model fitting to the density profile indicate that Terzan 6 is in an advanced stage of its dynamical evolution. We also determined the absolute age of the system, finding $t=13\pm 1 $ Gyr, in agreement with the old ages found for the globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. From the re-determination of the absolute magnitude of the red giant branch bump and the recent estimate of the cluster global metallicity, we find that Terzan 6 nicely matches the tight relation between these two parameters drawn by the Galactic globular cluster population.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>Triple Evolution Pathways to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Insights from V404 Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent discovery shows that V404 Cygni, a prototypical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH-LMXB) is a hierarchical triple: the BH and donor star are orbited by a $1.2$ M$_{\odot}$ tertiary at a distance of at least $3500$ au. Motivated by this system, we evolve a grid of $\sim50,000$ triple star systems, spanning a broad range of initial orbits. Our calculations employ {\tt MESA} stellar evolution models, using {\tt POSYDON}, and self-consistently track the effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) oscillations, mass loss, tides, and BH natal kicks. In our simulations, the progenitors of V404 Cygni-like systems have initial outer separations of $1000 - 10000$ au and inner separations of $\sim100$ au, such that they avoid Roche lobe overflow most of the time. Later on, EKL oscillations drive the inner binary to high eccentricities until tides shrink the orbit and mass transfer begins. Notably, such systems only form in simulations with very weak black hole natal kicks ($\lesssim 5\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) because stronger kicks unbind the tertiaries. Our simulations also predict a population of BH-LMXB triples that form via the classical common-envelope channel, when the BH progenitor does overflow its Roche lobe. The formation rate for this channel is also higher in triples than in isolated binaries because early EKL oscillations cause inner binaries with a wider range of initial separations to enter and survive a common envelope. Our calculations demonstrate that at least some stellar BHs form with extremely weak kicks, and that triple evolution is a significant formation channel for BH-LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Investigating Solar Wind Outflows from Open-Closed Magnetic Field Structures Using Coordinated Solar Orbiter and Hinode Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ESA/NASA's Solar Orbiter (SO) allows us to study the solar corona at closer distances and from different perspectives, which helps us to gain significant insights into the origins of the solar wind. In this work, we present the analysis of solar wind outflows from two locations: a narrow open-field corridor and a small, mid-latitude coronal hole. These outflows were observed off-limb by the Metis coronagraph onboard SO and on-disk by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. Magnetic field extrapolations suggest that the upflow regions seen in EIS were the sources of the outflowing solar wind observed with Metis. We find that the plasma associated with the narrow open-field corridor has higher electron densities and lower outflow velocities compared to the coronal hole plasma in the middle corona, even though the plasma properties of the two source regions in the low corona are found to be relatively similar. The speed of solar wind from the open-field corridor also shows no correlation with the magnetic field expansion factor, unlike the coronal hole. These pronounced differences at higher altitudes may arise from the dynamic nature of the low-middle corona, in which reconnection can readily occur and may play an important role in driving solar wind variability.</description>

      <title>The Impact of $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the Presupernova Evolution and Supernova Explodability of Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of massive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\odot$ and the solar metallicity. We show that the {\sl explodability} of these stars, i.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive to the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass fractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further enhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is strengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the contraction of outer layers and decrease the {\sl compactness parameter} at $M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores of Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell in the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the model is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the pressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar structure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning shell above which the model is more likely to explode. We conclude that the smaller $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate makes the mass range of $M ({\rm ZAMS})$ that forms a NS larger.</description>

      <title>Bow Shock and Local Bubble Plasma Unveiled by the Scintillating Millisecond Pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionized interstellar medium contains au-scale (and below) structures that scatter radio waves from pulsars, resulting in scintillation. Power spectral analysis of scintillation often shows parabolic arcs, with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of the pulsar, Earth, and interstellar plasma. Here we report the discovery of 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient interstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago. The Local Bubble is cool enough in areas for sub-au density fluctuations to arise from turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437-4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437-4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437-4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437-4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>
