      <title>Identification of Gamma Ray Pulsar Candidates in the \emph{Fermi}-LAT 4FGL-DR4 Unassociated Sources Using Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been continuously providing good quality
  survey data of the entire sky in the high energy range from 30 MeV to 500 GeV and above since August 2008. A succession of gamma-ray
  source catalogs is published after a comprehensive analysis of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT data. The most recent release of data in the
  fourth \emph{Fermi}--LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources (4FGL-DR4), based on the first 14 years of observations in the energy band
  50 MeV-1 TeV, contains 7195 sources. A large fraction ($\sim$ 33\%) of this population has no known counterparts in the lower wave
  bands. Such high energy gamma-ray sources are referred to as unassociated or unidentified. An appropriate classification of these
  objects into known type of gamma-ray sources such as the active galactic nuclei or pulsars is essential for population studies and
  pointed multi-wavelength observations to probe the radiative processes. In this work, we perform a detailed classification of the
  unassociated sources reported in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog using two supervised machine learning techniques-Random Forest and
  Extreme Gradient Boosting. We mainly focus on the identification of new gamma-ray pulsar candidates by making use of different
  observational features derived from the long-term observations with the \emph{Fermi}--LAT and reported in the incremental 4FGL-DR4 catalog.
  We also explore the effects of data balancing approach on the classification of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT unassociated sources.</description>

      <title>Neutrino signal from the hadron-quark phase transition in the conversion of Neutron Stars into Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate in a 1D General Relativistic (GR) hydrodynamic simulation the neutrino luminosity in an astrophysical scenario where a neutron star (NS) displays a hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) into a Quark Star (QS). Deconfinement is triggered once the central density exceeds a critical threshold above $\sim 3n_0$ being $n_0$, saturation density. We use descriptions based on DD2 and the MIT Bag model equations of state (EOSs). We account for neutrinos using a microphysics forward emission model including $e^-e^+$ annihilation, plasmon decay, nucleon (N) modified (or direct) Urca processes, and $NN$ bremsstrahlung, and, for the post transition, the quark direct Urca and an opacity-based leakage scheme with GR redshift. We find that the neutrino light curve generically develops a short $\simeq$10-50 ms, spectrally harder feature near deconfinement, appearing as either a prompt shoulder or a distinct secondary peak. Heavy lepton neutrinos result in a delayed peak with respect to the previous. We identify three diagnostics that are only mildly degenerate with hadronic uncertainties: (i) an enhanced peak-to-plateau ratio $R_{\rm pp}$ sourced by latent-heat release, (ii) a characteristic lag $\Delta t$ between the collapse rise and the HQPT feature that tracks the central density trajectory, and (iii) a flavor hardening $\Delta\!\langle E_\nu\rangle$ driven by quark-matter phase space. After MSW flavor conversion, these signatures remain detectable with current experiments. For a Galactic event ($d\sim 10$ kpc), IceCube and Hyper-K should resolve the HQPT feature and distinguish it from both no transition NS collapse and canonical core-collapse supernova (CCSN) templates.</description>

      <title>Low-Frequency Gravitational Waves in Three-Dimensional Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the low-frequency gravitational wave signals from three state-of-the-art three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models produced with the \textsc{Chimera} supernova code. We provide a detailed derivation of the gravitational wave signal sourced from the anisotropic emission of neutrinos and provide the total (fluid sourced and neutrino sourced) gravitational waves signal generated in our models. We discuss the templatablity of this low-frequency signal, which is useful for future work involving matched filtering for signal detection and parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope Pattern Speeds in the Visibility Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope is preparing to produce time sequences of black hole images, or movies. In anticipation, we developed an autocorrelation technique to measure apparent rotational motion using the image-domain pattern speed $\Omega_p$. Here, we extend this technique to the visibility domain and introduce the visibility amplitude pattern speed $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$. We show that in the Illinois v3 library of EHT source models, $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ depends on the source inclination, black hole mass, black hole spin, accretion state (MAD or SANE), and baseline length, and then provide approximate fits for this dependence. We show that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is particularly sensitive to baseline length for MAD (strongly magnetized) models, and that the slope of this dependence can be used to constrain black hole spin. As with $\Omega_p$, models predict that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is well below the Keplerian frequency in the emission region for all model parameters. This is consistent with the idea that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ measures an angular phase speed for waves propagating through the emission region. Finally, we identify the information that would be provided by space-based millimeter VLBI such as the proposed BHEX mission.</description>

      <title>A Sharper View of the X-ray Spectrum of MCG--6-30-15 with XRISM, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-averaged spectral analysis of the 2024 XRISM observation of the narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15, taken contemporaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona, modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong, relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is required in order to obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence of a $v_{\rm out} \sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find tentative evidence for a $v_{\rm out} \sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset, emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis in unambiguously measuring the physical properties of variable AGN.</description>

      <title>A study of 80 known pulsars at 185 MHz using MWA incoherent drift-scan observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of 80 known pulsars observed at 185 MHz has been conducted using archival incoherent-sum data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The dataset comprises 48 drift-scan observations from the MWA Voltage Capture System, covering approximately 30,000 square degrees of sky with sensitivities reaching about 8 mJy in the deepest regions. An optimized PRESTO-based search pipeline was deployed on the China SKA Regional Centre infrastructure. This enabled the detection of 80 known pulsars, representing a 60 percent increase over the previous census. Notably, this includes 30 pulsars with first-time detections at this frequency, of which pulse profiles and flux densities are presented. Spectral, scattering, and pulse-width properties were examined for the sample, providing observational constraints on low-frequency turnover, propagation effects, and width-period relations. This study highlights the value of wide-field, low-frequency time-domain surveys for constraining pulsar emission and propagation, offering empirical insights that may inform future observations with instruments such as SKA-Low.</description>

      <title>3D Moving-mesh Hydrodynamical Simulations of Wind/Jet Driven Ultraluminous X-ray Source Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform 3 dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations of bubble nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources, using state-of-the-art software AREPO. We use a Monte-Carlo method to inject outflows with uniform mass outflow rate and momentum, in a conical funnel with a specific half opening angle. Simulation results show that the morphology of the bubble is determined by the initial momentum of the outflows, while the mechanical power of the outflows only influences the size of the bubble without changing its shape. Low mechanical power also results in a short cooling timescale of the system, leading to an early collapse of the bubble shell. The half opening angle of the outflows and the viewing angle of the system determine the observed bubble eccentricity together. Compared with the observational morphology of the ULX bubble sources NGC 55 ULX-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, our simulation favors the fact that the high velocity outflows of the accretion disks in these two systems are confined in a narrow funnel region.</description>

      <title>Sub-Threshold Fermi-LAT Sources in the Vicinity of KM3-230312A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration has recently reported the detection of an extraordinary ultra-high-energy neutrino event with an energy of 220 PeV. Ultrahigh energy neutrinos and gamma-rays are co-produced in ultrahigh energy cosmic-ray interactions. The ultrahigh energy gamma-rays produced alongside the KM3NeT neutrino may quickly cascade down to lower energies due to interactions with intergalactic photons and magnetic fields. Because of this, the KM3NeT neutrino could be accompanied by an observable GeV - TeV gamma-ray signal. We investigate the data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope for transient and sub-threshold gamma-ray sources in the vicinity of the KM3NeT neutrino. We find three sub-threshold sources with TS $\gtrsim 16$ within $3.5^{\circ}$ of the neutrino event not included in any existing \textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogs. One of the three, J0616.1-0428, is a transient sub-threshold gamma-ray source that appears only after the neutrino observation, but may be the unrelated flaring of a nearby microquasar. Another sub-threshold source, J0621.1-0610, also exhibits fluctuations in gamma-rays immediately following the neutrino observation, and may be coincident with a radio blazar. We note that the number of sub-threshold sources observed around the KM3NeT neutrino could be expected at another sky region of the same Galactic latitude, and that the fluctuations they exhibit appear to be consistent with background.</description>

      <title>Light Travel Time Effects in Kilonova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo -- commonly attributed to strontium -- possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light -- and therefore the light travel time to an observer -- contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the X-ray counterpart of the H{\alpha} filaments and of the sloshing spiral in the Perseus galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Chandra observations of the Perseus galaxy cluster have allowed for the discovery of X-ray counterparts to the H{\alpha} filamentary structures and of a sloshing spiral. However, both components are extremely faint, and their study is largely hindered by the volume-filling hot intracluster medium (ICM). Using the Poisson General Morphological Component Analysis (pGMCA) algorithm, a blind source separation method adapted for Poissonian statistics, we were able to extract detailed, clean morphological maps of these components. We then introduced a template fitting method to investigate their spectral characteristics. We report the first direct observation of about 1.35 keV low-energy emission from the sloshing spiral, and produce the most detailed and unpolluted map of the X-rays filaments thus far obtained.</description>

      <title>SN 2021lwz: Another Exotic Luminous and Fast Evolving Optical Type Ic Broad-Lined Supernova ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims. We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \simeq -14.5$ AB. Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN 2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5 x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.24 ~M_\odot$) took place in a low mass ($M \sim 10^{6.66}~M_\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions. Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe Types. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu and SN 2018gep.</description>

      <title>Dark matter Simplified models in the Resonance Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle-physics nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the central open questions in modern physics. A widely used framework to investigate DM properties is provided by simplified models (DMSimps), which extend the Standard Model with a DM particle and a mediator that connects the visible and dark sectors. Much of the DMSimps parameter space is already constrained by direct and indirect detection, collider searches, and the measured DM relic abundance. We show, however, that the resonant regime $m_{\rm DM}\simeq m_{\rm med}/2$ remains viable under current bounds and will be stringently tested by forthcoming experiments. Using a full Boltzmann treatment that allows for departures from kinetic equilibrium near resonance, we demonstrate that this regime can reproduce the observed relic density with couplings compatible with direct-detection limits. We also show that models with s-wave-dominated annihilation can explain the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess with couplings consistent with relic-density and direct-detection constraints. Finally, we propose two minimal constructions that naturally realize $m_{\rm med} \approx 2m_{\rm DM}$, making the resonant scenario generic rather than fine-tuned.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Analysis of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: The Joint-likelihood Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) formed in galaxy mergers are promising multi-messenger sources. They can be identified as quasars with periodic variability in electromagnetic (EM) time-domain surveys. The most massive of those systems can be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the nanohertz frequency gravitational-wave (GW) band. We present a method to simultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger data stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the likelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this approach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the Rubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a ~30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in ~2035. We compare our multi-messenger analysis with analyses that take into account the EM and PTA data separately. We find that the joint likelihood approach results in improved parameter estimation with smaller percent errors compared to the distinct analyses that consider only EM or PTA data separately. Among the SMBHB parameters, the binary total mass and the orbital inclination show the greatest improvement. We also compare our multi-messenger pipeline with an analysis, in which the EM constraints are used as priors to the PTA analysis. We demonstrate that the joint likelihood approach delivers tighter constraints on all binary parameters, with systematically higher values of Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the deviation of the posterior distribution from the prior.</description>

      <title>Effect of Finite-Temperature $\beta$-Decay Rates on the Rapid Neutron Capture Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\beta$-decay is known to play an essential role in the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) during $(n, \gamma) \leftrightarrow (\gamma, n)$ equilibrium and freeze-out when the neutron-rich nuclei decay back to stability. Recent systematic theoretical studies on $\beta$-decay at finite temperature indicated that under hot conditions ($T\sim10$~GK), a significant acceleration of $\beta$-decay rates is expected, especially for nuclei near stability. This corresponds to the early stage of the $r$-process. In this study, we investigate the effect of the $\beta$-decays in finite temperature using the rates calculated with the finite-temperature proton-neutron relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation (FT-PNRQRPA). We explore a variety of astrophysical conditions and find that the effect on the abundance pattern is significant in hot and moderately neutron-rich conditions such as are expected in magnetorotational supernovae. Accelerated $\beta$-decay rates also increase the heating rate in the early phase, resulting in an additional modification of the final abundance pattern.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between Black Holes and Neutron Stars within a Population of Weak Tidal Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ability of tidal signatures within the inspiral of compact binaries observed through gravitational waves (GWs) to distinguish between neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). After quantifying how hard this measurement is on a single-event basis, we investigate the ability of a large catalog of GW detections to constrain the fraction of NS in the population as a function of mass: $f_{\mathrm{NS}}(m)$. Using simulated catalogs with realistic measurement uncertainty, we find that $&gt; O(200)$ events will be needed before we can precisely measure $f_{\mathrm{NS}}$, and catalogs of $&gt; O(100)$ events will be needed before we can even rule out the possibility that all low-mass objects are BHs with GW data alone (i.e., without electromagnetic counterparts). Therefore, this is unlikely to occur with advanced detectors, even at design sensitivity. Nevertheless, it could be feasible with next-generation facilities like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Thermal and magnetic effects on viscosity in Binary Neutron Star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star mergers, proto-neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae involve finite temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Previous studies on the effect of magnetic fields on flavor-equilibration processes such as direct Urca relied on the Fermi surface approximation, which is not a reliable approximation in the neutrino-transparent regime of matter in supernovae or neutron star mergers. In a recent study, we went beyond the Fermi surface approximation, performing the full phase space integral to obtain direct Urca rates in background magnetic field. In this work, we extend these calculations to include collisional broadening effects by employing the recently developed nucleon width approximation. We demonstrate the impact of magnetic fields on the flavor-equilibrium condition for two finite-temperature equations of state with different direct Urca thresholds. We also study the impact of magnetic fields on the bulk viscous dissipation of density oscillations relevant in postmerger scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Coherent structures created through turbulent cascades play a key role in energy dissipation and particle acceleration. In this work, we investigate both current and vorticity sheets in 3D particle-in-cell simulations of decaying relativistic turbulence in pair plasma by training a self-organizing map to recognize these structures. We subsequently carry out an extensive statistical analysis to reveal their geometric and structural properties. This analysis is systematically applied across a range of magnetizations ($\sigma$) and fluctuating-to-mean magnetic field strengths ($\delta B_0/B_0$) to assess how these parameters influence the resulting structures. We find that the structures' geometric properties form power-law distributions in their probability density functions (PDFs), with the exception of the structure width, which generally exhibits an exponential distribution peaking around 2 electron skin depths. The measurements show weak dependence on $\sigma$ but a strong dependence on $\delta B_0/B_0$. Finally, we investigate the spatial relationship between current sheets and vorticity sheets. We find that most current sheets are directly associated with at least one vorticity sheet neighbor and are often situated between two vorticity sheets. These findings provide a detailed statistical framework for understanding the formation and organization of coherent structures in relativistic magnetized turbulence, allowing for their incorporation into updated theoretical models for structure-based energy dissipation and particle acceleration processes crucial for interpreting high-energy astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Distributions of Host Dispersion Measures in the Fast Radio Burst Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As is well known, Hubble tension is one of the most serious challenges in cosmology to date. So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts (FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology proposed by Macquart {\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant $H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current ${\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\rm IGM}$ fairly close to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125 localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of modifying $\sigma_\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$, here we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\rm DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\ell$ and $e^\mu$, respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\rm DM_{host}$ are overwhelmingly strong.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra for the Photospheric Phase of a 3D Stripped-Envelope Supernova Explosion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present synthetic light curves and spectra from three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations based on a 3D core-collapse supernova explosion model of an ultra-stripped $3.5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor. Our calculations predict a fast and faint transient with $\Delta m_{15} \sim 1\texttt{-} 2\,\mathrm{mag}$ and peak bolometric luminosity between $-15.3\,\mathrm{mag}$ and $-16.4\,\mathrm{mag}$. Due to a large-scale unipolar asymmetry in the distribution of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, there is a pronounced viewing-angle dependence with about $1\,\mathrm{mag}$ difference between the directions of highest and lowest luminosity. The predicted spectra for this rare class of explosions do not yet match any observed counterpart. They are dominated by prominent Mg~II lines, but features from O, C, Si, and Ca are also found. In particular, the O~I line at \wl{7}{774} appears as a blended feature together with Mg~II emission. Our model is not only faster and fainter than the observed Ib/c supernova population, but also shows a correlation between higher peak luminosity and larger $\Delta m_{15}$ that is not present in observational samples. A possible explanation is that the unusually small ejecta mass of our model accentuates the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry. We suggest that the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry may be used to constrain asymmetries in explosion models of more typical stripped-envelope supernova progenitors in future.</description>

      <title>The systemic recoil velocity distribution and the scale height of field millisecond pulsar systems: Implications on neutron star retention fractions in star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation channel(s) and for estimating the retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters. However, the determination is complicated by MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 64 field MSP systems that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. Assuming that the Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ are statistically stable over time (the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption), we approached the distribution of the $v_\mathrm{l}$ components of $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ by the observed $v_\mathrm{l}$ sample. We find that the observed $v_\mathrm{l}$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Accordingly, the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components under the assumption that $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of field MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.68 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\approx14$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster with the nominal 50 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of field MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in globular clusters, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as field MSP systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.</description>

      <title>Luminous Late-time Radio Emission from Supernovae Interacting with Circumbinary Material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse, with companions that best represent low-mass compact objects. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim 10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray view of two $\gamma$-ray detected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: NGC 315 and NGC 4261</title>

Abstract: Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method for extracting a mass parameter using time-dependent density functional theory for an arbitrary physical system, provided the adiabatic limit is achievable. This approach works for collective variables also in the presence of a medium, in particular for the nuclei interacting with a neutron background. We apply the method to extract mass parameters of impurities in the neutron star crust, like their inertial masses and quadrupole mass parameters. The extracted mass parameters at various depths of the inner crust are compared with other methods, including the hydrodynamic approach. The presented method opens avenues for the construction of an effective model of neutron star crust grounded in microscopic calculations.</description>

Abstract: Numerical relativity has produced profound and extensive impacts on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this work, we develop a Python interface for the numerical relativity program AMSS-NCKU. This interface enables the automation of initializing and executing the AMSS-NCKU simulations, as well as the automated visualization of the output data. To show the practical utility of this Python interface, we present two representative examples of numerical relativity simulations (the binary and triple black hole merger processes), obtaining well-behaved stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems. The Python operational interface significantly reduces the operational complexity of the AMSS-NCKU simulation workflow, lowering the technical barriers for freshman users.
