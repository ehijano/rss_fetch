      <title>Collective dynamics on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions that nonlinearly couple more than two nodes are ubiquitous in networked systems. Here we provide an overview of the rapidly growing field of dynamical systems with higher-order interactions, and of the techniques which can be used to describe and analyze them. We focus in particular on new phenomena that emerge when nonpairwise interactions are considered. We conclude by discussing open questions and promising future directions on the collective dynamics of higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Computing frustration and near-monotonicity in deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider, we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models. From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural balance) means that the function representing the network behaves near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form of implicit regularization.</description>

      <title>Cored product codes for quantum self-correction in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call "cored product codes". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits.</description>

      <title>Memory behavior of a randomly driven model glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate by atomistic simulations the memory behavior a model glass subjected to random driving protocols. The training consists of a random walk of forward and/or backward shearing sequences bounded by a maximal shear strain of absolute value {\gamma}T . We show that such a stochastic training protocol is able to record the training amplitude. Different read-out protocols are also tested and are shown to be able to retrieve the training amplitude. We then emphasize the ten- sorial character of the memory encoded in the glass sample and then characterize the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the trained samples.</description>

      <title>Field Free Spin-Orbit Torque Controlled Synapse and Stochastic Neuron Devices for Spintronic Boltzmann Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spintronics offers a promising approach to energy efficient neuromorphic computing by integrating the functionalities of synapses and neurons within a single platform. A major challenge, however, is achieving field-free spin orbit torque SOT control over both synaptic and neuronal devices using an industry-adopted spintronic materials stack. In this study, we present field-free SOT spintronic synapses utilizing a CoFeB ferromagnetic thin film system, where asymmetrical device design and specifically added lateral notches in the CoFeB thin film facilitate effective domain wall DW nucleation, movement, and pinning and depinning. This method yields multiple analog, nonvolatile resistance states with enhanced linearity and symmetry, resulting in programmable and stable synaptic weights. We provide a systematic measurement approach to improve the linearity and symmetry of the synapses. Additionally, we demonstrate nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs that function as SOT-driven stochastic neurons, exhibiting current-tunable, Boltzmann-like probabilistic switching behavior, which provides an intrinsic in-hardware Gibbs sampling capability. By integrating these synapses and neurons into a Boltzmann machine complemented by a classifier layer, we achieve recognition accuracies greater than 98 percent on the MNIST dataset and 86 percent on Fashion MNIST. This work establishes a framework for field free synaptic and neuronal devices, setting the stage for practical, materials-compatible, and all spintronic neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Analytic expressions for estimation of the critical properties of inhomogeneous Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications of spin models, the fast estimation of their critical temperatures and other physical properties is of great importance. In this work, we present the analytical expressions estimating the critical properties of inhomogeneous Ising models with ferromagnetic interactions. The expressions were obtained within the framework of the m-vicinity method. The accuracy of the critical temperature estimations was evaluated through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. Special attention was given to the case when the model consists of two interacting interpenetrating homogeneous sublattices, and relationships for the compositional dependence of the critical temperature were derived.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Data and Tasks: Theories of Locality and Compositionality in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning representations.</description>
