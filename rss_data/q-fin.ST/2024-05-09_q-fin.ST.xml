      <title>Generalization of the Alpha-Stable Distribution with the Degree of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Wright function based framework is proposed to combine and extend several distribution families. The $\alpha$-stable distribution is generalized by adding the degree of freedom parameter. The PDF of this two-sided super distribution family subsumes those of the original $\alpha$-stable, Student's t distributions, as well as the exponential power distribution and the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Its CDF leads to a fractional extension of the Gauss hypergeometric function. The degree of freedom makes possible for valid variance, skewness, and kurtosis, just like Student's t. The original $\alpha$-stable distribution is viewed as having one degree of freedom, that explains why it lacks most of the moments. A skew-Gaussian kernel is derived from the characteristic function of the $\alpha$-stable law, which maximally preserves the law in the new framework. To facilitate such framework, the stable count distribution is generalized as the fractional extension of the generalized gamma distribution. It provides rich subordination capabilities, one of which is the fractional $\chi$ distribution that supplies the needed 'degree of freedom' parameter. Hence, the "new" $\alpha$-stable distribution is a "ratio distribution" of the skew-Gaussian kernel and the fractional $\chi$ distribution. Mathematically, it is a new form of higher transcendental function under the Wright function family. Last, the new univariate symmetric distribution is extended to the multivariate elliptical distribution successfully.</description>

      <title>Zero-Inflated Autoregressive Conditional Duration Model for Discrete Trade Durations with Excessive Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.07318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In finance, durations between successive transactions are usually modeled by the autoregressive conditional duration model based on a continuous distribution omitting zero values. Zero or close-to-zero durations can be caused by either split transactions or independent transactions. We propose a discrete model allowing for excessive zero values based on the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution with score dynamics. This model allows to distinguish between the processes generating split and standard transactions. We use the existing theory on score models to establish the invertibility of the score filter and verify that sufficient conditions hold for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood of the model parameters. In an empirical study, we find that split transactions cause between 92 and 98 percent of zero and close-to-zero values. Furthermore, the loss of decimal places in the proposed approach is less severe than the incorrect treatment of zero values in continuous models.</description>

      <title>An Intraday GARCH Model for Discrete Price Changes and Irregularly Spaced Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel observation-driven model for high-frequency prices. We account for irregularly spaced observations, simultaneous transactions, discreteness of prices, and market microstructure noise. The relation between trade durations and price volatility, as well as intraday patterns of trade durations and price volatility, is captured using smoothing splines. The dynamic model is based on the zero-inflated Skellam distribution with time-varying volatility in a score-driven framework. Market microstructure noise is filtered by including a moving average component. The model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method. In an empirical study of the IBM stock, we demonstrate that the model provides a good fit to the data. Besides modeling intraday volatility, it can also be used to measure daily realized volatility.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction techniques to support insider trading detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification of market abuse is an extremely complicated activity that requires the analysis of large and complex datasets. We propose an unsupervised machine learning method for contextual anomaly detection, which allows to support market surveillance aimed at identifying potential insider trading activities. This method lies in the reconstruction-based paradigm and employs principal component analysis and autoencoders as dimensionality reduction techniques. The only input of this method is the trading position of each investor active on the asset for which we have a price sensitive event (PSE). After determining reconstruction errors related to the trading profiles, several conditions are imposed in order to identify investors whose behavior could be suspicious of insider trading related to the PSE. As a case study, we apply our method to investor resolved data of Italian stocks around takeover bids.</description>
