      <title>Entanglement signatures of a percolating quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In this work, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder, free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties. These emerge from massively degenerate eigenspaces where the notion of standard bipartite entanglement entropy needs to be revisited. We show that appropriately defined entanglement measures can capture both geometrical aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. Using a variety of toy models, we uncover the rich phenomenology of this physics. We further show that there are decipherable signatures of the classical percolation transition in these entanglement properties. Our work presents an interesting interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.</description>

      <title>Spectral Initialization for High-Dimensional Phase Retrieval with Biased Spatial Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a spectral initialization method that plays a central role in contemporary research on signal estimation in nonconvex scenarios. In a noiseless phase retrieval framework, we precisely analyze the method's performance in the high-dimensional limit when sensing vectors follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution for two rotationally invariant models of the covariance matrix C. In the first model C is a projector on a lower dimensional space while in the second it is a Wishart matrix. Our analytical results extend the well-established case when C is the identity matrix. Our examination shows that the introduction of biased spatial directions leads to a substantial improvement in the spectral method's effectiveness, particularly when the number of measurements is less than the signal's dimension. This extension also consistently reveals a phase transition phenomenon dependent on the ratio between sample size and signal dimension. Surprisingly, both of these models share the same threshold value.</description>

      <title>Probing marginal stability in the spherical $p=2$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the marginally stable nature of the low-temperature trivial spin glass phase in the spherical $p=2$ spin glass, by perturbing the system with three different kinds of non-linear interactions. In particular, we compare the effect of three additional dense four-body interactions: ferromagnetic couplings, purely disordered couplings and couplings with competing disordered and ferromagnetic interactions. Our study, characterized by the effort to present in a clear and pedagogical way the derivation of all the results, shows that the marginal stability property of the spherical spin glass depends in fact on which kind of perturbation is applied to the system: in general, a certain degree of frustration is needed also in the additional terms in order to induce a transition from a trivial to a non-trivial spin-glass phase. On the contrary, the addition of generic non-frustrated interactions does not destabilize the trivial spin-glass phase.</description>

      <title>Emergent strength-dependent scale-free mobility edge in a non-reciprocal long-range Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of mobility edge in an Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with non-reciprocal long-range hopping. The results reveal that there can be a new type of mobility edge featuring both strength-dependent and scale-free properties. By calculating the fractal dimension, we find that the positions of mobility edges are robust to the strength of non-reciprocal long-range hopping. Furthermore, through scale analysis of the observables such as fractal dimension, eigenenergy and eigenstate, etc., we prove that four different specific mobility edges can be observed in the system. This paper extends the family tree of mobility edges and hopefully it will shed more light on the related theory and experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electron localization in disordered quantum systems, focusing on both individual eigenstates and thermal states. We employ complex polarization as a numerical indicator to characterize the system's localization length. Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of mean-field approximation in providing a quantitative analysis of such systems. Through this study, we seek to provide insight into the following aspects: the behavior of electron localization as a function of interaction, disorder, and temperature, whether thermal states and highly excited states exhibit similar properties in many-body localized systems, and the reliability of the mean-field approximation in low-interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>The autoregressive neural network architecture of the Boltzmann distribution of pairwise interacting spins systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Autoregressive Neural Networks (ARNNs) have recently demonstrated exceptional results in image and language generation tasks, contributing to the growing popularity of generative models in both scientific and commercial applications. This work presents an exact mapping of the Boltzmann distribution of binary pairwise interacting systems into autoregressive form. The resulting ARNN architecture has weights and biases of its first layer corresponding to the Hamiltonian's couplings and external fields, featuring widely used structures such as the residual connections and a recurrent architecture with clear physical meanings. Moreover, its architecture's explicit formulation enables the use of statistical physics techniques to derive new ARNNs for specific systems. As examples, new effective ARNN architectures are derived from two well-known mean-field systems, the Curie-Weiss and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, showing superior performance in approximating the Boltzmann distributions of the corresponding physics model compared to other commonly used architectures. The connection established between the physics of the system and the neural network architecture provides a means to derive new architectures for different interacting systems and interpret existing ones from a physical perspective.</description>

      <title>Generalized Dynamical Keldysh Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a certain class of exactly solvable models, describing spectral properties an electron moving in random in time external field with different statistical characteristics. This electron can be band - like or belong to a quantum well. The known dynamical Keldysh model is generalized for the case of fields with finite correlation time of fluctuations and for finite transfer frequencies of these fluctuations. In all cases we are able to perform the complete summation of all Feynman diagrams of corresponding perturbation series for the Green's function. This can be done either by the reduction of this series to some continuous fraction or by the use of the generalized Ward identity from which we can derive recurrence relations for the Green's function. In the case of a random field with finite transferred frequency there appear the interesting effects of modulation of spectral density and density of states.

      <title>New insights into the origin of the first sharp diffraction peak in amorphous silica from an analysis of chemical and radial ordering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural origin of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in amorphous silica is studied by analyzing chemical and radial ordering of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms in binary amorphous networks. The study shows that the chemical order involving Si--O and O--O pairs play a major role in the formation of the FSDP in amorphous silica. This is supplemented by small contributions arising from the relatively weak Si--Si correlations in the Fourier space. A shell-by-shell analysis of the radial correlations between Si--Si, Si--O and O--O atoms in the network reveals that the position and the intensity of the FSDP are largely determined by atomic pair correlations originating from the first two/three radial shells on a length scale of about 5--8 {\AA}, whereas the fine structure of the intensity curve in the vicinity of the FSDP is perturbatively modified by atomic correlations arising from the radial shells beyond 8 {\AA}. The study leads to a simple mathematical relationship between the position of the radial peaks ($r_k$) in the partial pair-correlation functions and the diffraction peaks ($Q_k$) that can be used to obtain approximate positions of the FSDP and the principal peak. The results are complemented by numerical calculations and an accurate semi-analytical expression for the diffraction intensity obtained from the partial pair-correlation functions of amorphous silica for a given radial shell.</description>

      <title>On the temperature dependence of the density of states of liquids at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report neutron-scattering measurements of the density of states (DOS) of water and liquid Fomblin in a wide range of temperatures. In the liquid phase, we confirm the presence of a universal low-energy linear scaling of the experimental DOS as a function of the frequency, $g(\omega)= a(T) \omega$, which persists at all temperatures. The low-frequency scaling of the DOS exhibits a sharp jump at the melting point of water, below which the standard Debye's law, $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is recovered. On the contrary, in Fomblin, we observe a continuous transition between the two exponents reflecting its glassy dynamics, which is confirmed by structure measurements. More importantly, in both systems, we find that the slope $a(T)$ grows with temperature following an exponential Arrhenius-like form, $a(T) \propto \exp(-\langle E \rangle /T)$. We confirm this experimental trend using molecular dynamics simulations and show that the prediction of instantaneous normal mode (INM) theory for $a(T)$ is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Localization, fractality, and ergodicity in a monitored qubit</title>

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of a single two-level system (qubit) subject to repetitive ancilla-based measurements. This setup is a fundamental minimal model for exploring the intricate interplay between the unitary dynamics of the system and the nonunitary stochasticity introduced by quantum measurements, which is central to the phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. We demonstrate that this "toy model" harbors remarkably rich dynamics, manifesting in the distribution function of the qubit's quantum states in the long-time limit. We uncover a compelling analogy with the phenomenon of Anderson localization, albeit governed by distinct underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the state distribution function of the monitored qubit, parameterized by a single angle on the Bloch sphere, exhibits diverse types of behavior familiar from the theory of Anderson transitions, spanning from complete localization to almost uniform delocalization, with fractality occurring between the two limits. By combining analytical solutions for various special cases with two complementary numerical approaches, we achieve a comprehensive understanding of the structure delineating the "phase diagram" of the model. We categorize and quantify the emergent regimes and identify two distinct phases of the monitored qubit: ergodic and nonergodic. Furthermore, we identify a genuinely localized phase within the nonergodic phase, where the state distribution functions consist of delta peaks, as opposed to the delocalized phase characterized by extended distributions. Identification of these phases and demonstration of transitions between them in a monitored qubit are our main findings.</description>

      <title>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the Debye contribution, is often identified as a characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes involving one-dimensional (1D) string-like excitations (``stringlets"). We build on a theory originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in simulations. We provide an analytical prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the observed glass transition temperature $T_g$. The prediction involves no free parameters and accords quantitatively with prior simulation observations in 2D and 3D model glasses based on inverse power law potentials. The comparison of the string model to observations is more uncertain when compared to simulations of an Al-Sm metallic glass material at temperatures well above $T_g$. Nonetheless, our stringlet theory of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of glass-forming liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in both experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology and topological statistics of hyperuniform point clouds</title>

Abstract: Hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, is observed across a wide variety of domains, from cosmology to condensed matter and biological systems. Although the standard definition of hyperuniformity only utilizes information at the largest scales, hyperuniform configurations have distinctive local characteristics. However, the influence of global hyperuniformity on local structure has remained largely unexplored; establishing this connection can help uncover long-range interaction mechanisms and detect hyperuniform traits in finite-size systems. Here, we study the topological properties of hyperuniform point clouds by characterizing their persistent homology and the statistics of local graph neighborhoods. We find that varying the structure factor results in configurations with systematically different topological properties. Moreover, these topological properties are conserved for subsets of hyperuniform point clouds, establishing a connection between finite-sized systems and idealized reference arrangements. Comparing distributions of local topological neighborhoods reveals that the hyperuniform arrangements lie along a primarily one-dimensional manifold reflecting an order-to-disorder transition via hyperuniform configurations. The results presented here complement existing characterizations of hyperuniform phases of matter, and they show how local topological features can be used to detect hyperuniformity in size-limited simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces the extent of contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>
