      <title>Linearization of Monge-Amp\`ere equations and data science applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport has proven to have numerous applications in data science. In some of those, differentiating the transport map with respect to the densities in the Fr\'echet sense is required. In this work, we prove that for a compact, uniformly convex set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a $\mathcal{C}^1$ curve of densities $\{p_t\} \subset \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\Omega)$ that are uniformly bounded away from zero and infinity, the curve of transport maps $\{\nabla \phi_t\} \subset \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\Omega)$, pushing $Q$ forward to $P_t$ (where $P_t$ admits density $p_t$ and $Q$ is sufficiently regular), is also $\mathcal{C}^1$. The proof is based on applying the implicit function theorem to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with natural boundary conditions. To achieve this, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the {\it linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation}, an elliptic partial differential equation characterized by strictly oblique boundary conditions and a null zero-order term. We emphasize two significant applications of this result. Firstly, it enables non-parametric inference on the Monge map, paving the way for the construction of confidence bands for the transport map. Secondly, it establishes the regularity of the transport-based quantile regression function with respect to the covariates.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for embedded obstacles in electromagnetic scattering with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the time-harmonic electromagnetic (EM) scattering problem in a general medium which may possess a nontrivial topological structure. We model this by an inhomogeneous and possibly anisotropic medium with embedded obstacles and the EM waves cannot penetrate inside the obstacles. Such a situation naturally arises in studying inverse EM scattering problems from complex mediums with partial boundary measurements, or inverse problems from EM mediums with metal inclusions. We develop a novel theoretical framework by showing that the embedded obstacles can be effectively approximated by a certain isotropic medium with a specific choice of material parameters. We derive sharp estimates to verify this effective approximation and also discuss the practical implications of our results to the inverse problems mentioned above, which are longstanding topics in inverse scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Solutions to discrete nonlinear Kirchhoff-Choquard equations with power nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following Kirchhoff-Choquard equation $$ -\left(a+b \int_{\mathbb{Z}^3}|\nabla u|^{2} d \mu\right) \Delta u+h(x) u=\left(R_{\alpha}\ast|u|^{p}\right)|u|^{p-2}u,\quad x\in \mathbb{Z}^3, $$ where $a,\,b&gt;0$, $\alpha \in(0,3)$ are constants and $R_{\alpha}$ is the Green's function of the discrete fractional Laplacian that behaves as the Riesz potential. Under some suitable assumptions on potential function $h$, for $p&gt;2$, we first establish the existence of ground state solutions based on the Nehari manifold. Subsequently, for $p&gt;4$, we obtain the existence of ground state sign-changing solutions by adopting constrained minimization arguments on the sign-changing Nehari manifold.</description>

      <title>Pseudodifferential operators on manifolds with scaled bounded geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general black box result which produces algebras of pseudodifferential operators (ps.d.o.s) on noncompact manifolds, together with a precise principal symbol calculus. Our construction (which also applies in parameter-dependent settings, with phase space weights and variable differential and decay orders) recovers most of the ps.d.o. algebras which have been introduced in recent years as tools for the microlocal analysis of non-elliptic partial differential equations. This includes those used for proving resolvent bounds (b- and scattering algebras and resolved or semiclassical versions thereof), studying waves on asymptotically flat spacetimes (3b-, edge-b-, and desc-algebras), inverting geodesic X-ray transforms (semiclassical foliation and 1-cusp algebras), and many others.
  Our main result rests on the novel notion of manifolds with scaled bounded geometry. A scaling encodes, in each distinguished chart of a manifold with bounded geometry, the amounts in $(0,1]$ by which the components of a uniformly bounded vector field are scaled. This decouples the regularity of the coefficients of elements of the resulting Lie algebra $\mathcal{V}$ of vector fields from the pointwise size of their coefficients. When the scaling tends to $0$ at infinity, the approximate constancy of coefficients of elements of $\mathcal{V}$ on increasingly large cubes, as measured using $\mathcal{V}$, gives rise to a principal symbol which captures $\mathcal{V}$-operators modulo operators of lower differential order and more decay.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are devoted to studying the positive weak, punctured or distributional solutions to the biharmonic Lane-Emden equation
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta^{2} u=u^{p}
  \quad
  \quad \text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^{N}\setminus Z,

  where $N\geq5$, $1&lt;p\leq\frac{N+4}{N-4}$, and the singular set $Z$ represents a closed and proper subset of $ \left\lbrace x_{1}=0\right\rbrace $. The symmetry and monotonicity properties of the singular solutions will be given by taking advantage of the moving plane method and the approach of moving spheres.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stratification and sharp regularity estimate for supercritical nonlinear elliptic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the interior regularity theory for stationary solutions of the supercritical nonlinear elliptic equation $$ -\Delta u=|u|^{p-1}u\quad\text{in }\Omega,\quad p&gt;\frac{n+2}{n-2}, $$ where $ \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n $ is a bounded domain with $ n\geq 3 $. Our primary focus is on the structure of stratification for the singular sets. We define the $ k $-th stratification $ S^k(u) $ of $ u $ based on the tangent functions and measures. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of $ S^k(u) $ is at most $ k $ and $ S^k(u) $ is $ k $-rectifiable, and establish estimates for volumes associated with points that have lower bounds on the regular scales. These estimates enable us to derive sharp interior estimates for the solutions. Specifically, if $ \alpha_p=\frac{2(p+1)}{p-1} $ is not an integer, then for any $ j\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} $, we have $$ D^ju\in L_{\operatorname{loc}}^{q_j,\infty}(\Omega), $$ which implies that for any $ \Omega'\subset\subset\Omega $, $$ \sup\{\lambda&gt;0:\lambda^{q_j}\mathcal{L}^n(\{x\in\Omega':|D^ju(x)|&gt;\lambda\})\}&lt;+\infty, $$ where $ \mathcal{L}^n(\cdot) $ is the $ n $-dimensional Lebesgue measure, and $$ q_j=\frac{(p-1)(\lfloor\alpha_p\rfloor+1)}{2+j(p-1)}, $$ with $ \lfloor\alpha_p\rfloor $ being the integer part of $ \alpha_p $. The proofs of these results rely on Reifenberg typed theorems developed in \cite{NV17} to study the stratification of harmonic maps.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Poroelasticity with Thermal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes and explores a linear hydrodynamic thermo-elasticity system within mixture models, comprising fluid and solid phases, with a focus on biological tissues, particularly tumor-related phenomena. Although tumor growth is not yet incorporated, this work aims to comprehend the interaction between thermal effects and hydrodynamics on short-time scales where the tumor size typically remains stable. We establish the existence of a unique weak solution within the framework of implicit evolution equations, overcoming challenges posed by intricate coupling mechanisms within the system. To further investigate the model, we then study the one-dimensional model and explore in detail the complex interplay between fluid flow, solid deformation, and heat transfer. This complex coupled system of equations is reduced for the short time scale to obtain the semi-analytical solution.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of composite waves of degenerate Oleinik shock and rarefaction for non-convex conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the large-time behavior of the solution to one-dimensional (1D) cubic non-convex scalar viscous conservation laws. Due to the inflection point of the cubic non-convex flux, the solution to the corresponding inviscid Riemann problem can be the composite wave of a degenerate Oleinik shock and a rarefaction wave and these two nonlinear waves are always attached together. We give a first proof of the time-asymptotic stability of this composite wave, up to a time-dependent shift to the viscous Oleinik shock, for the viscous equation. The Oleinik shock wave strength can be arbitrarily large. The main difficulty is due to the incompatibility of the time-asymptotic stability proof framework of individual viscous shock by the so-called anti-derivative method and the direct $L^2$-energy method to rarefaction wave. Here we develop a new type of $a$-contraction method with suitable weight function and the time-dependent shift to the viscous shock, which is motivated by [9,12]. Another difficulty comes from that the Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave are always attached together and their wave interactions are very subtle. Therefore, the same time-dependent shift needs to be equipped to both Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave such that the wave interactions can be treated in our stability proof. Time-asymptotically, this shift function grows strictly sub-linear with respect to the time and then the shifted rarefaction wave is equivalent to the original self-similar rarefaction wave.</description>

      <title>Nuclearity, Schatten-von Neumann classes, distribution of eigenvalues and $L^p$-$L^q$-boundedness of Fourier integral operators on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We link Sogge's type $L^p$-estimates for eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on compact manifolds with the problem of providing criteria for the $r$-nuclearity of Fourier integral operators. The classes of Fourier integral operators $I^\mu_{\rho,1-\rho}(X,Y;C)$ considered here are associated with complex canonical relations $C$, i.e. they are parametrised by a complex-valued phase function. Our analysis also includes the case of real canonical relations, namely, the class of Fourier integral operators with real-valued phase functions. The nuclear trace in the sense of Grothendieck is investigated for these operators as well as the validity of the Grothendieck-Lidskii formula on Lebesgue spaces. Criteria are presented in terms of the factorisation condition for the complex canonical relation. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership of Fourier integral operators in Schatten-von Neumann classes are presented in the case where the Schatten index $r&gt;0$ belongs to the set $\mathbb{N} $ and sharp sufficient conditions are presented in the general case $r&gt;0$. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership of Fourier integral operators to the ideal of trace class operators and to the ideal of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on $L^2(X)$. The rate of decay of eigenvalues and the trace of Fourier integral operators is also investigated in both settings, in the Hilbert space case of $L^2(X)$ using Schatten-von Neumann properties and in the context of the Banach spaces $L^p(X),$ $1&lt;p&lt;\infty,$ utilising the notion of $r$-nuclearity.</description>

      <title>The Initial Stages of a Generic Singularity for a 2D Pressureless Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the equations of pressureless gases in two space dimensions. For a generic set of smooth initial data (density and velocity), it is known that the solution loses regularity at a finite time $t_0$, where both the the density and the velocity gradient become unbounded. Aim of this paper is to provide an asymptotic description of the solution beyond the time of singularity formation. For $t&gt;t_0$ we show that a singular curve is formed, where the mass has positive density w.r.t.1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The system of equations describing the behavior of the singular curve is not hyperbolic. Working within a class of analytic data, local solutions can be constructed using a version of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem. For this purpose, by a suitable change of variables we rewrite the evolution equations as a first order system of Briot-Bouquet type, to which a general existence-uniqueness theorem can then be applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem to the three-dimensional primitive equations for the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics with only horizontal eddy viscosities in the horizontal momentum equations and only vertical diffusivity in the temperature equation in the domain $\Omega=M\times(-h,h)$, with $M=(0,1)\times(0,1)$. Global well-posedness of strong solutions is established, for any initial data $(v_0,T_0) \in H^1(\Omega)\cap L^\infty(\Omega)$ with $(\partial_z v_0, \nabla_H T_0) \in L^q(\Omega)$ and $v_0 \in L_z^1(B^1_{q,2}(M))$, for some $q \in (2,\infty)$, by using delicate energy estimates and maximal regularity estimate in the anisotropic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Stokes eigenvalue problem in open balls and open annuli in R3 with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using the frame of toroidal and poloidal fields we construct the othogonal decomposition of the Stokes eigenvalue problem in problems for toroidal and poloidal eigenfunctions. This provides the proof of the completeness of a system of explicitly calculated Stokes eigenfunctions given by one of the authors in 1999, [14].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a general complete Riemannian manifold $M$, we introduce the concept of "local Moser-Trudinger inequality on $W^{1,n}(M)$". We show how the validity of the Moser-Trudinger inequality can be extended from a local to a global scale under additional assumptions: either by assuming the validity of the Poincar\'e inequality, or by imposing a stronger norm condition. We apply these results to Hadamard manifolds. The technique is general enough to be applicable also in sub-Riemannian settings, such as the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>On local energy decay for solutions to the b-family of peakon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the long time behavior of solutions to the $b$-family of peakon equations. We prove local energy decay of global solutions under suitable hypotheses. Assuming the global bound of the $H^1(\mathbb R)$ norm, we show local energy decay along sequences of time in an expanding region around the origin. If we assume nonnegativity for an initial momentum, $m_0(x) = (u - \partial_x^2 u)(0,x)$, we show strict decay on a similar region. Moreover, we show decay in an exterior region given the same nonnegativity condition.</description>

      <title>Generalized incompressible fluid dynamical system interpolating between the Navier-Stokes and Burgers equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a set of generalized incompressible fluid dynamical equations, which interpolates between the Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions and study their properties theoretically and numerically. It is well-known that under the assumption of potential flows the multi-dimensional Burgers equations are integrable in the sense they can be reduced to the heat equation, via the so-called Cole-Hopf linearization. On the other hand, it is believed that the Navier-Stokes equations do not possess such a nice property. Take, for example, the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and rotate the velocity gradient by 90 degrees, we then obtain a system which is equivalent to the Burgers equations. Based on this observation, we introduce a system of generalized incompressible fluid dynamical equations by rotating velocity gradient through a continuous angle parameter. That way we can compare properties of an integrable system with those of non-integrable ones by relating them through a continuous parameter. Using direct numerical experiments we show how the flow properties change (actually, deteriorate) when we increase the angle parameter $\alpha$ from 0 to $\pi/2$. It should be noted that the case associated with least regularity, namely the Burgers equations ($\alpha=\pi/2$), is integrable via the heat kernel. We also formalize a perturbative treatment of the problem, which in principle yields the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations on the basis of that of the Burgers equations. The principal variations around the Burgers equations are computed numerically and are shown to agree well with the results of direct numerical simulations for some time.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth globally hyperbolic $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime $(M,g)$ satisfying the Einstein vacuum equations (possibly with cosmological constant) and an inextendible timelike geodesic $\mathcal{C}$, we constructed in Part I a family of metrics $g_\epsilon$ on the complement $M_\epsilon\subset M$ of an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $\mathcal{C}$ with the following behavior: away from $\mathcal{C}$ one has $g_\epsilon\to g$ as $\epsilon\to 0$, while the $\epsilon^{-1}$-rescaling of $g_\epsilon$ around every point of $\mathcal{C}$ tends to a fixed subextremal Kerr metric; and $g_\epsilon$ solves the Einstein vacuum equation modulo $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ errors. The ultimate goal, achieved in Part III, is to correct $g_\epsilon$ to a true solution on any fixed precompact subset of $M$ by addition of a size $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ metric perturbation which needs to satisfy a quasilinear wave equation (the Einstein vacuum equations in a suitable gauge).
  The present paper lays the necessary analytical foundations. We develop a framework for proving estimates for solutions of (tensorial) wave equations on $(M_\epsilon,g_\epsilon)$ which, on a suitable scale of Sobolev spaces, are uniform on $\epsilon$-independent precompact subsets of the original spacetime $M$. These estimates are proved by combining two ingredients: the spectral theory for the corresponding wave equation on Kerr; and uniform microlocal estimates governing the propagation of regularity through the small black hole, including radial point estimates reminiscent of diffraction by conic singularities and long-time estimates near perturbations of normally hyperbolic trapped sets.
  As an illustration of this framework, we construct solutions of a toy nonlinear scalar wave equation on $(M_\epsilon,g_\epsilon)$ for uniform timescales and with full control in all asymptotic regimes as $\epsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Gluing small black holes along timelike geodesics III: construction of true solutions and extreme mass ratio mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth globally hyperbolic $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime $(M,g)$ satisfying the Einstein vacuum equations (possibly with cosmological constant) and an inextendible timelike geodesic $\mathcal{C}$, we construct, on any compact subset of $M$, solutions $g_\epsilon$ of the Einstein equations which describe a mass $\epsilon$ Kerr black hole traveling along $\mathcal{C}$. More precisely, away from $\mathcal{C}$ one has $g_\epsilon\to g$ as $\epsilon\to 0$, while the $\epsilon^{-1}$-rescaling of $g_\epsilon$ around every point of $\mathcal{C}$ tends to a fixed subextremal Kerr metric. Our result applies on all spacetimes with noncompact Cauchy hypersurfaces, and also on spacetimes which do not admit nontrivial Killing vector fields in a neighborhood of a point on the geodesic. As an application, we construct spacetimes which model the merger of a very light subextremal Kerr black hole with a slowly rotating unit mass Kerr(-de Sitter) black hole, followed by the relaxation of the resulting black hole to its final Kerr(-de Sitter) state.
  In Part I, we constructed approximate solutions $g_{0,\epsilon}$ of the gluing problem which satisfy the Einstein equations only modulo $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ errors. Part II introduces a framework for obtaining uniform control of solutions of linear wave equations on $\epsilon$-independent precompact subsets of the original spacetime $(M,g)$. In this final part, we show how to correct $g_{0,\epsilon}$ to a true solution $g_\epsilon$ by adding a metric perturbation of size $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ which solves a carefully chosen gauge-fixed version of the Einstein vacuum equations. The main novel ingredient is the proof of suitable mapping properties for the linearized gauge-fixed Einstein equations on subextremal Kerr spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Finite Entropy Measures in K\"{a}hler Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the concept of finite entropy measures in K\"ahler geometry. We define the finite $p$-entropy related to $\omega$-plurisubharmonic functions and demonstrate their inclusion in an appropriate energy class. Our study is anchored in the analysis of finite entropy measures on compact K\"ahler manifolds, drawing inspiration from fundamental works of Di Nezza, Guedj, and Lu. Utilizing a celebrated result by Darvas on the existence of a Finsler metric on the energy classes, we conclude this paper with a stability result for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

Abstract: The Riesz potential and its potential theory are closely related to the regularity of solutions to partial differential equations. In this paper, we investigate a class of Minkowski type problems that are closely associated with convex geometry and geometric probability. This investigation leads to a novel result regarding the boundary regularity of the Riesz potential, which is essential for developing the regularity theory of a new nonlocal {M}onge-{A}mp\`ere equation. As an initial application, the existence of a smooth solution to the chord log-Minkowski problem shall be obtained from the perspective of a nonlocal elliptical partial differential equation and a nonlocal Gauss curvature flow equation.</description>

      <title>A Schiffer-type problem for annuli with applications to stationary planar Euler flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If on a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ there is a nonconstant Neumann eigenfunction $u$ that is locally constant on the boundary, must $\Omega$ be a disk or an annulus? This question can be understood as a weaker analog of the well known Schiffer conjecture, in that the function $u$ is allowed to take a different constant value on each connected component of $\partial \Omega$ yet many of the known rigidity properties of the original problem are essentially preserved. Our main result provides a negative answer by constructing a family of nontrivial doubly connected domains $\Omega$ with the above property. As a consequence, a certain linear combination of the indicator functions of the domains $\Omega$ and of the bounded component of the complement $\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\overline{\Omega}$ fails to have the Pompeiu property. Furthermore, our construction implies the existence of continuous, compactly supported stationary weak solutions to the 2D incompressible Euler equations which are not locally radial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat the Fisher-KPP equation with a Caputo-type time fractional derivative and discuss the propagation speed of the solution. The equation is a mathematical model that describes the processes of sub-diffusion, proliferation, and saturation. We first consider a traveling wave solution to study the propagation of the solution, but we cannot define it in the usual sense due to the time fractional derivative in the equation. We therefore assume that the solution asymptotically approaches a traveling wave solution, and the asymptotic traveling wave solution is formally introduced as a potential asymptotic form of the solution. The existence and the properties of the asymptotic traveling wave solution are discussed using a monotone iteration method. Finally, the behavior of the solution is analyzed by numerical simulations based on the result for asymptotic traveling wave solutions.</description>

      <title>Harnack inequalities for kinetic integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the following wide class of kinetic equations, $$ \big[\partial_t \,+\, v\cdot\nabla_x \big] f \, = \, L_v f. $$ Above, the diffusion term $L_v$ is an integro-differential operator, whose nonnegative kernel is of fractional order $s\in(0,1)$ having merely measurable coefficients.
  Firstly, we obtain a general $L^\infty$-interpolation inequality with a natural nonlocal tail term in velocity, in turn giving local boundedness even for weak subsolutions $f$ without any sign assumption. This is a veritable novelty, being boundedness usually assumed apriori in such a setting. Then, provided that their nonlocal tail in velocity is $(2\!+\!\varepsilon)$-summable along the transport variables, we prove a general Strong Harnack inequality, which in the simpler case of globally nonnegative weak solutions $f$ reads as follows $$ \sup_{Q^-} f \ \leq \ c\,\inf_{Q^+} f \,+ \, c\,\| {\textrm {Tail}} (f)\|_{L^{2+\varepsilon}_{t,x}}\,, $$ where $Q^{\pm}$ are suitable slanted cylinders. This is the first strong Harnack inequality for kinetic integral equations under the aforementioned tail summability assumption, which is in fact naturally implied in literature, e.g., from the usual mass density boundedness (as for the Boltzmann equation without cut-off), and in clear accordance with the very recent surprising counterexample by Kassmann and Weidner; see arXiv:2405.05223.
  A new standalone result, a Besicovitch-type covering argument for very general kinetic geometries, independent on the involved equation is also needed, stated and proved.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the initial-boundary value problem for the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar (SLLBar) equation with Stratonovich-type noise in bounded domains $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=1,2,3$. Our main results can be briefly described as follows: (1) for $d=1,2,3$ and any $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{H}^1$, the SLLBar equation admits a unique local-in-time pathwise weak solution; (2) for $d=1$ and small-data $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{H}^1$, the SLLBar equation has a unique global-in-time pathwise weak solution and at least one invariant measure; (3) for $d=1,2$ and small-data $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{L}^2$, the SLLBar equation possesses a unique global-in-time pathwise very weak solution and at least one invariant measure, while for $d=3$ only the existence of martingale solution is obtained due to the loss of pathwise uniqueness.</description>

Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness and scattering for the 3D incompressible Euler-Coriolis system with sufficiently small, regular and suitably localized initial data. Equivalently, we obtain the asymptotic stability for "rigid body" rotational solutions to the pure Euler equations.

Abstract: We consider families of strongly indefinite systems of elliptic PDE and investigate bifurcation from a trivial branch of solutions by using the spectral flow. The novelty in our approach is a refined version of a comparison principle that was originally proved by Pejsachowicz in a joint work with the third author, and which is based on an index theorem for a certain class of Fredholm operators that is of independent interest. Finally, we use our findings for a bifurcation problem on shrinking domains that originates from works of Morse and Smale.</description>

      <title>Integrating the probe and singular sources methods: III. Mixed obstacle case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to develop further the integrated theory of the probe and singular sources methods (IPS) which may work for a group of inverse obstacle problems. Here as a representative and typical member of the group, an inverse obstacle problem governed by the Helmholtz equation with a fixed wave number in a bounded domain is considered. It is assumed that the solutions of the Helmholtz equation outside the set of unknown obstacles satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on each surface of obstacles. This is the case when two extreme types of obstacles are embedded in a medium. By considering this case, not only a concise technique for IPS is introduced but also a general correspondence principle from IPS to the probe method is suggested. Besides, as a corollary it is shown that the probe method together with the singular sources method reformulated in terms of the probe method has the Side B under a smallness conditions on the wave number $k$, which is the blowing up property of a sequence computed from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

Abstract: We prove the well-posed character of a regularity structure formulation of the quasilinear generalized (KPZ) equation and give an explicit form for a renormalized equation in the full subcritical regime. Under the assumption that the BPHZ models associated with a non-translation invariant operator converge, we obtain a convergence result for the solutions of the regularized renormalized equations. This conditional result covers the spacetime white noise case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth globally hyperbolic $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime satisfying the Einstein vacuum equations (possibly with cosmological constant) and an inextendible timelike geodesic, we construct a family of metrics depending on a small parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$ with the following properties. (1) They solve the Einstein vacuum equations modulo $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$. (2) Away from the geodesic they tend to the original metric as $\epsilon\to 0$. (3) Their $\epsilon^{-1}$-rescalings near every point of the geodesic tend to a fixed subextremal Kerr metric. Our result applies on all spacetimes with noncompact Cauchy hypersurfaces, and also on spacetimes without nontrivial Killing vector fields in a neighborhood of a point on the geodesic. If $(M,g)$ is a neighborhood of the domain of outer communications of subextremal or extremal Kerr(-anti de~Sitter) spacetime, our metrics model extreme mass ratio mergers if we choose the timelike geodesic to cross the event horizon.
  The metrics which we construct here depend on $\epsilon$ and the (rescaled) coordinates on the original spacetime in a log-smooth fashion. This in particular justifies the formal perturbation theoretic setup in work of Gralla-Wald on gravitational self-force in the case of small black holes.</description>

      <title>Constant $Q$-curvature metrics on a product Riemannian manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be an analytic Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \geq 5$. In this paper, we consider the so-called constant $Q$-curvature equation \[ \varepsilon^4\Delta_{g}^2 u -\varepsilon^2 b \Delta_{g} u +a u = u^{p} , \qquad \text{in } M, \quad u&gt;0, \quad u\in H^2_g(M) \] where $a,b$ are positive constants such that $b^2-4 a&gt;0$, $p$ is a sub-critical exponent $1&lt;p&lt;2^\#-1=\frac{n+4}{n-4}$, $\Delta_g$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator and $\Delta_g^2:=\Delta_{g}(\Delta_{g})$ is the bilaplacian operator on $M$.
  We show that, if $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is small enough, then positive solutions to the above constant $Q$-curvature equation are generated by a maximum or minimum point of the function $\tau_g$, given by \[
  \tau_g(\xi):= \sum_{i, j=1}^{n} \frac{\partial^{2} g_{\xi}^{i i}}{\partial z_{j}^{2}}(0),
  \] where $g_{\xi}^{i j}$ denotes the components of the inverse of the metric $g$ in geodesic normal coordinates. This result shows that the geometry of $M$ plays a crucial role in finding solutions to the equation above and provides a metric of constant $Q$-curvature on a product manifold of the form $(M\times X, g+\varepsilon^2 h)$ where $(M,g)$ is flat and closed, and $(X,h)$ any $m$-dimensional Einstein Riemannian manifold, $m\geq 3$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any asymptotically conical self-shrinker, there exists an embedded closed hypersurface such that the mean curvature flow starting from it develops a singularity modeled on the given shrinker. The main technique is the Wa\.zewski box argument, used by Stolarski in the proof of the corresponding theorem in the Ricci flow case. As a corollary, our construction, combined with the works of Angenent--Ilmanen--Vel\'azquez and Chodosh--Daniels-Holgate--Schulze, implies the existence of fattening level set flows starting from smooth embedded closed hypersurfaces. These provide examples related to a question asked by Evans--Spruck.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>
