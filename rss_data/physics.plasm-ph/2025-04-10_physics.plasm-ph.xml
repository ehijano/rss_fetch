      <title>Upper Limit of Fusion Reactivity in Laser-Driven $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the averaged fusion reactivity of the $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ reaction in tabletop laser experiments using a plasma expansion model. We investigate the energy distribution of proton beams accelerated by lasers as a function of electron temperature $T_e$ and the dimensionless acceleration time $\omega_{pi} t_{\rm acc}$, where $\omega_{pi}$ is the ion plasma frequency. By combining these distributions with the fusion cross-section, we identify the optimal conditions that maximize the fusion reactivity, with $\left\langle \sigma v \right\rangle = 8.12 \times 10^{-16}\,{\rm cm^3/s}$ at $k_B T_e = 10.0\,{\rm MeV}$ and $\omega_{pi} t_{\rm acc} = 0.503$. These findings suggest that an upper limit exists for the fusion reactivity achievable in laser-driven $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ fusion experiments, even under optimized conditions.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic effects in an inductively coupled plasma wind tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a three-dimensional model for the 350kW Plasmatron X inductively coupled plasma facility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, designed for testing high-temperature materials. Simulations of the facility have been performed using a three-dimensional, multiphysics computational framework, which reveals pronounced three-dimensional characteristics within the facility. The analysis of the plasma and electromagnetic field in the torch region reveals the influence of the helical coils, which cause a non-axisymmetric distribution of the plasma discharge. Additionally, simulations of the torch-chamber configuration at two operating pressures have been conducted to examine the impact of plasma asymmetry in the torch on jet characteristics in the chamber. The results indicate an unsteady, three-dimensional behavior of the plasma jet at high pressure. Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) has been performed on the unsteady flow field to identify the dominant modes and their associated frequencies. At low pressure, a steady, supersonic, nearly axisymmetric plasma jet forms with consistent flow properties, such as temperature and velocity. However, strong non-equilibrium effects at low pressures lead to substantial deviations in species concentrations from axial symmetry despite having an almost axisymmetric distribution for quantities such as velocity and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD), which couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$, are known to support solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four HMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, which retains finite electron inertia, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Physics-tailored machine learning reveals unexpected physics in dusty plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dusty plasma is a mixture of ions, electrons, and macroscopic charged particles that is commonly found in space and planetary environments. The particles interact through Coulomb forces mediated by the surrounding plasma, and as a result, the effective forces between particles can be non-conservative and non-reciprocal. Machine learning (ML) models are a promising route to learn these complex forces, yet their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. Here we demonstrate and experimentally validate an ML approach that incorporates physical intuition to infer force laws in a laboratory dusty plasma. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries, non-identical particles, and learns the effective non-reciprocal forces between particles with exquisite accuracy (R^2&gt;0.99). We validate the model by inferring particle masses in two independent yet consistent ways. The model's accuracy enables precise measurements of particle charge and screening length, discovering large deviations from common theoretical assumptions. Our ability to identify new physics from experimental data demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems. Furthermore, we anticipate our ML approach to be a starting point for inferring laws from dynamics in a wide range of many-body systems, from colloids to living organisms.</description>
