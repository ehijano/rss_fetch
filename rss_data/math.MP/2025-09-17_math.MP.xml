      <title>A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to Asymptotic Analysis of Toeplitz+Hankel Determinants II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we continue the development of the Riemann-Hilbert formalism for studying the asymptotics of Toeplitz+Hankel determinants with non-identical symbols, which we initiated in \cite{GI}. In \cite{GI}, we showed that the Riemann-Hilbert problem we formulated admits the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent analysis, but with a special restriction on the winding numbers of the associated symbols. In particular, the most natural case, namely zero winding numbers, is not allowed. A principal goal of this paper is to develop a framework that extends the asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz+Hankel determinants to a broader range of winding-number configurations. As an application, we consider the case in which the winding numbers of the Szeg\H{o}-type Toeplitz and Hankel symbols are zero and one, respectively, and compute the asymptotics of the norms of the corresponding system of orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Projective limits in Euclidean quantum field theory, I: Free scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two constructions of projective systems of measures associated to discretizations of free scalar Euclidean quantum fields. The first one is obtained using only purely combinatorial data and applies to free massless scalar fields on polyhedral cell complexes. The second construction utilizes the suitably discretized covariance of the free massive scalar field on a compact Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <title>Topological Levinson's theorem and corrections at thresholds: the full picture in a quasi-1D example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various threshold effects are investigated on a discrete quasi-1D scattering system. In particular, one of these effects is to add corrections to Levinson's theorem. We explain how these corrections are due to the opening or to the closing of channels of scattering, and how these contributions can be computed as partial winding numbers on newly introduced operators. Embedded thresholds, thresholds associated with changes of spectral multiplicity, and doubly degenerate thresholds are exhibited and analyzed. Most of the investigations are of an analytical nature, but the final equalities rely on a C*-algebraic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider dissipative Schroedinger operators of the form $H=-\Delta+V(x)$ on $L^2(\mathbb R^3)$, with $V(x)$ a complex, bounded and decaying potential with a non-positive imaginary part. We prove a topological version of Levinson's theorem corresponding to an index theorem for the discrete, complex spectrum of $H$.</description>

      <title>Higher Abelian Quantum Double Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the generalized version of the quantum double model on arbitrary $N$-dimensional simplicial complexes with finite local regularity. The core of our analysis is a detailed characterization of the frustration-free ground state space $\mathrm{FG}_{\mathrm{QDM}}(\mathfrak{A})$. A central result is the construction of the algebra of logical operators $\mathfrak{A}_{\mathrm{log}} := \mathfrak{K}'/\mathfrak{J}$, where the redundancy ideal $\mathfrak{J}$ quotients out operators that act trivially on the ground state space. We prove a homeomorphism between the state space of $\mathfrak{A}_{\mathrm{log}}$ and $\mathrm{FG}_{\mathrm{QDM}}(\mathfrak{A})$, effectively classifying all frustration-free ground states. This logical algebra is shown to exhibit generalized Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR). When the relevant (co)homology groups are finite, $\mathfrak{A}_{\mathrm{log}}$ is isomorphic to $C(X_c) \otimes \mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{h}_q)$, revealing that the ground state space can encode $c$ classical bits and $q$ quantum bits (qubits), providing a precise measure of its information storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.</description>

      <title>Trombone gaugings of five-dimensional maximal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximal gauged supergravities in five spacetime dimensions with gauge groups contained in $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are described. The $\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ factor is the duality group of ungauged maximal supergravity and $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the scaling symmetry of the five-dimensional metric, usually called the \textit{trombone} symmetry. The equations of motion and supersymmetry variations for these supergravities are given to lowest order in fermions, and the mass matrices are provided. Then, the theories with gauge groups contained in a maximal subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are classified, and a new family of such supergravities uncovered. For a concrete theory in this class, some supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are found and their mass spectra computed within the gauged supergravity. These vacua are argued to be related to superconformal phases of the M5-brane field theory.</description>

      <title>Spectra of random graphs with discrete scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random graphs defined by an occurrence probability that is invariant under node aggregation have been identified recently in the context of network renormalization. The invariance property requires that edges are drawn with a specific probability that, in the annealed case, depends on a necessarily infinite-mean node fitness. The diverging mean determines many properties that are uncommon in models with independent edges, but at the same time widespread in real-world networks. Here we focus on the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the model, where the n nodes are assigned a Pareto($\alpha$)-distributed fitness with 0 &lt; $\alpha$ &lt; 1. We find that the leading eigenvalues are all of order square root of n, alternate in sign and are located at the intersection between the real axis and a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane, which we characterize analytically in terms of the Gamma function. We also calculate the associated eigenvectors, finding that they display complexvalued scaling exponents and log-periodicity, which are signatures of discrete scale invariance. In contrast with the typical finite-rank behaviour of random graphs with finite-mean variables, we find that a growing number of the leading eigenvalues emerges from the bulk, whose edge extends up to order square root of n and therefore reaches the same scale as that of the structural eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of the Larson-Penston collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove nonlinear stability of the Larson-Penston family of self-similarly collapsing solutions to the isothermal Euler-Poisson system. Our result applies to radially symmetric perturbations and it is the first full nonlinear stability result for radially imploding compressible flows. At the heart of the proof is the ground state character of the Larson-Penston solution, which exhibits important global monotonicity properties used throughout the proof.
  One of the key challenges is the proof of mode-stability for the non self-adjoint spectral problem which arises when linearising the dynamics around the Larson-Penston collapsing solution. To exclude the presence of complex growing modes other than the trivial one associated with time translation symmetry, we use a high-order energy method in low and high frequency regimes, for which the monotonicity properties are crucially exploited, and use rigorous computer-assisted techniques in the intermediate regime. In addition, the maximal dissipativity of the linearised operator is proven on arbitrary large backward light cones emanating from the singular point using the global monotonicity of the Larson-Penston solutions. Such a flexibility in linear analysis also facilitates nonlinear analysis and allows us to identify the exact number of derivatives necessary for the nonlinear stability statement. The proof is based on a two-tier high-order weighted energy method which ties bounds derived from the Duhamel formula to quasilinear top order estimates. To prove global existence we further use the Brouwer fixed point theorem to identify the final collapse time, which suppresses the trivial instability caused by the time-translation symmetry of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uniqueness of purifications of quantum states on a system $A$ up to local unitary transformations on a purifying system $B$ is central to quantum information theory. We show that, if the two systems are modelled by commuting von Neumann algebras $M_A$ and $M_B$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, then uniqueness of purifications is equivalent to Haag duality $M_A = M_B'$. In particular, the uniqueness of purifications can fail in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom -- even when $M_A$ and $M_B$ are commuting factors that jointly generate $B(\mathcal H)$ and hence allow for local tomography of all density matrices on $\mathcal H$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Velocity Domination in quantized polarized Gowdy Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic velocity domination (AVD) posits that when back-propagated to the Big Bang generic cosmological spacetimes solve a drastically simplified version of the Einstein field equations, where all dynamical spatial gradients are absent (similar as in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario). Conversely, a solution can in principle be reconstructed from its behavior near the Big Bang. This property has been rigorously proven for the Gowdy class of cosmologies, both polarized and unpolarized. Here we establish for the polarized case a quantum version of the AVD property formulated in terms of two-point functions of (the integrands of) Dirac observables: these correlators approach their much simpler velocity dominated counterparts when the time support is back-propagated to the Big Bang. Conversely, the full correlators can be expressed as a uniformly convergent series in averaged spatial gradients of the velocity dominated ones.</description>

      <title>A generalized reduction scheme for the Stochastic Weighted Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Weighted Particle Method (SWPM) of Rjasanow and Wagner is a generalization of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method for computing the probability density function of the velocities of a system of interacting particles for applications that include rarefied gas dynamics and plasma processing systems. Key components of a SWPM simulation are a particle grouping technique and particle reduction scheme. These are periodically applied to reduce the computational cost of simulations due to the gradual increase in the number of stochastic particles. A general framework for designing particle reduction schemes is introduced that enforces the preservation of a prescribed set of moments of the distribution through the construction and explicit solution of a system of linear equations for particle weights in terms of particle velocities and the moments to be preserved. This framework is applied to preserve all moments of the distribution up to order three. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the scheme and quantify the degree to which even higher-order moments and tail functionals are preserved. These results reveal an unexpected trade off between the preservation of these higher-order moments and tail functionals.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of random perturbations of non-normal Toeplitz matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral properties of Toeplitz operators and their finite truncations have long been central in operator theory. In the finite dimensional, non-normal setting, the spectrum is notoriously unstable under perturbations. Random perturbations provide a natural framework for studying this instability and identifying spectral features that emerge in typical noisy situations. This article surveys recent advances on the spectral behavior of (polynomially vanishing) random perturbations of Toeplitz matrices, focusing mostly on the limiting spectral distribution, the distribution of outliers, and localization of eigenvectors, and highlight the major techniques used to study these problems. We complement the survey with new results on the limiting spectral distribution of polynomially vanishing random perturbation of Toeplitz matrices with continuous symbols, on the limiting spectral distribution of finitely banded Toeplitz matrices under exponentially and super-exponentially vanishing random perturbations, and on the complete localization of outlier eigenvectors of randomly perturbed Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Reversibility of Quantum Resource Theories for Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recent proof of the Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma by Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2408.02722] to classical-quantum (c-q) channels. We analyze the composite hypothesis testing problem of testing a c-q channel $\mathcal{E}^{\otimes n}$ against a sequence of sets of c-q channels $(\mathcal{S}_n)_n$ (satisfying certain natural assumptions), under parallel strategies. We prove that the optimal asymptotic asymmetric error exponent is given by the regularization of Umegaki channel divergence, minimized over $\mathcal{S}_n$. This allows us to prove the reversibility of resource theories of classical-quantum channels in a natural framework, where the distance between channels (and hence also the notion of approximate interconvertibility of channels) is measured in diamond norm, and the set of free operations is the set of all asymptotically resource non-generating superchannels. The results we obtain are similar to the ones in the concurrent and independent work by Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2509.07271]. However the proof of the direct part of the GQSL uses different arguments and techniques to deal with the challenges that arise from dealing with c-q channels.</description>

      <title>Modular families of elliptic long-range spin chains from freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the construction of quantum-integrable spin chains with q-deformed long-range interactions by `freezing' integrable quantum many-body systems with spins. The input is a (quantum) spin-Ruijsenaars system along with an equilibrium configuration of the underlying spinless classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the resulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range limit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to long-range interacting spins. We focus on the elliptic case. We first define an action of the modular group on the spinless elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system to show that, for a fixed elliptic parameter, it has a whole modular family of classical equilibrium configurations. These typically have constant but nonzero momenta. Then we use the setting of deformation quantisation to provide a uniform framework for freezing elliptic spin-Ruijsenaars systems at any classical equilibrium whilst preserving quantum integrability. As we showed in previous work, the results include the Heisenberg, Inozemtsev and Haldane-Shastry chains along with their xxz-like q-deformations (face-type), or the antiperiodic Haldane-Shastry chain of Fukui-Kawakami, its elliptic generalisation of Sechin-Zotov, and their completely anisotropic q-deformations due to Matushko-Zotov (vertex type). Finally, we show how freezing fits in the setting of 'hybrid' integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Homotopies for Lagrangian field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the variational bicomplex for $\mathcal{E}$ the space of sections of a graded, affine bundle. Local functionals $\mathcal{F}$ are defined as an equivalence class of density-valued functionals, which represent Lagrangian densities. A choice of a $k$-symplectic local form $\omega$ on $\mathcal{E}$ induces a Lie$[k]$ algebra structure on (Hamiltonian) local functionals $(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}},\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{\mathrm{ham}})$. For any $\omega$ and any choice of a cohomological vector field $Q$ compatible with $\omega$, we build three explicit $L_\infty$ algebras on a resolution of $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}}$, which are all $L_\infty$ quasi-isomorphic to a dgL$[k]$a $(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}},d_{\mathrm{ham}},\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{\mathrm{ham}})$. In particular, one of our equivalent $L_\infty$ algebras is a dgL$[k]$ algebra. In the case $k=-1$, this provides an explicit lift of the standard Batalin--Vilkovisky framework to local forms enriched by the $L_\infty$ structure, in terms of local homotopies, which interprets the modified classical master equation as a Maurer--Cartan equation for the distinguished dgL$[k]$a we construct. We further provide a multisymplectic interpretation of the resulting data.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>

      <title>A piecewise linear homeomorphism of the circle which is periodic under renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a piecewise linear homeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which maps rationals to rationals, whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$, and whose rotation number is $\sqrt{2}-1$. This is achieved by showing that a renormalization procedure becomes periodic when applied to $f$. Our construction gives a negative answer to a question of D. Calegari. When combined with work of the 2nd and 3rd authors, our result also shows that $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ does not embed into $F$, where $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the subgroup of the Stein-Thompson group $F_{2,3}$ consisting of those elements whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$. Finally, we produce some evidence suggesting a positive answer to a variation of Calegari's question and record a number of computational observations.</description>

      <title>Composite Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of binary composite channel discrimination in the asymmetric setting, where the hypotheses are given by fairly arbitrary sets of channels, and samples do not have to be identically distributed. In the case of quantum channels we prove: (i) a characterization of the Stein exponent for parallel channel discrimination strategies and (ii) an upper bound on the Stein exponent for adaptive channel discrimination strategies. We further show that already for classical channels this upper bound can sometimes be achieved and be strictly larger than what is possible with parallel strategies. Hence, there can be an advantage of adaptive channel discrimination strategies with composite hypotheses for classical channels, unlike in the case of simple hypotheses. Moreover, we show that classically this advantage can only exist if the sets of channels corresponding to the hypotheses are non-convex. As a consequence of our more general treatment, which is not limited to the composite i.i.d. setting, we also obtain a generalization of previous composite state discrimination results.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars through the lens of correlation matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS that either have known analytic expressions or are captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find that the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively identify QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables the manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, thereby distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.</description>

      <title>On Computational Complexity of Unitary and State Design Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequalities and Unitary Dynamics in Quantum Field Theory: Scalar and Proca Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the role of unitary transformations in enhancing violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic quantum field theory. In quantum systems, all relevant observables can be expressed via unitary rotations of reference operators. We extend this perspective to a real massive free scalar field and to the Proca vector field in $(1+1)$ Minkowski spacetime. In two dimensions, the Proca theory carries only one degree of freedom and is known to be equivalent to the scalar theory, implying that both yield identical Bell-CHSH violations. After introducing suitable Hermitian operators, we employ Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to construct spacelike separated observables in the vacuum. We demonstrate that unitary deformations significantly increase the Bell-CHSH violation, approaching the Tsirelson bound, and we report the first explicit evaluation of such violation in a vector-field vacuum.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Quasibound states of massive charged scalars around dilaton black holes in $2+1$ dimensions: Exact frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in the background of three-dimensional dilaton black holes with a cosmological constant. We demonstrate that the wave equations governing the dynamics of these perturbations are exactly solvable, with the radial part expressible in terms of confluent Heun functions. The quasibound state frequencies are computed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's mass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge. Our analysis also underscores the crucial role played by the cosmological constant in shaping the behavior of these perturbations. This specific black hole metric arises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in $2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog gravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of acoustic analogs. Moreover, the analytic tractability of this system offers a valuable testing ground for exploring aspects of black hole spectroscopy, stability, and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The exact solvability facilitates deeper insights into the interplay between geometry and matter fields in lower-dimensional gravity, where quantum gravitational effects can be more pronounced. Such studies not only enrich our understanding of dilaton gravity and its string-theoretic implications but also pave the way for potential applications in simulating black hole phenomena in laboratory settings using analog models.</description>

Abstract: We obtain an upper bound on the heat kernel of the Keller-Segel finite particle system that exhibits blow up effects. The proof exploits a connection between Keller-Segel finite particles and certain non-local operators. The latter allows to address some aspects of the critical behaviour of the Keller-Segel system resulting from its two-dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the intuitive meaning of the Saint--Venant compatibility equation known from the linear theory of deformations. The linearized theory is typically obtained from the relations of finite deformation theory by neglecting higher-order terms. We show how to formulate the compatibility conditions for finite deformations and how the well-known equation for small deformations follows from this formulation.</description>

      <title>Topological Big Bangs: Reflection, Itty-Bitty Blenders, and Eternal Trumpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss and formalize a topological means by which the initial singularity might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. The construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Understanding Quantum Instruments Through the Analysis of $C^*$-Convexity and Their Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.</description>
