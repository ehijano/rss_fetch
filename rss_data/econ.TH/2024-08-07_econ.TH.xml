      <title>Centralization in Attester-Proposer Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Execution Tickets and Execution Auctions dramatically increase centralization in the market for block proposals, even without multi-block MEV concerns. Previous analyses have insufficiently or incorrectly modeled the interaction between ahead-of-time auctions and just-in-time (JIT) auctions. We study a model where bidders compete in an execution auction ahead of time, and then the winner holds a JIT auction to resell the proposal rights when the slot arrives. During the execution auction, bidders only know the distribution of their valuations. Bidders then draw values from their distributions and compete in the JIT auction. We show that a bidder who wins the execution auction is substantially advantaged in the JIT auction since they can set a reserve price higher than their own realized value for the slot to increase their revenue. As a result, there is a strong centralizing force in the execution auction, which allows the ex-ante strongest bidder to win the execution auction every time, and similarly gives them the strongest incentive to buy up all the tickets. Similar results trivially apply if the resale market is imperfect, since that only reinforces the advantages of the ex-ante strong buyer. To reiterate, these results do not require the bidders to employ multi-block MEV strategies, although if they did, it would likely amplify the centralizing effects.</description>

      <title>Inventory problems and the parametric measure $m_{\lambda}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02700</link>

Abstract: The credibility theory was introduced by B. Liu as a new way to describe the fuzzy uncertainty. The credibility measure is the fundamental notion of the credibility theory. Recently, L.Yang and K. Iwamura extended the credibility measure by defining the parametric measure $m_{\lambda}$ ($\lambda$ is a real parameter in the interval $[0,1]$ and for $\lambda= 1/2$ we obtain as a particular case the notion of credibility measure). By using the $m_{\lambda}$-measure, we studied in this paper a risk neutral multi-item inventory problem. Our construction generalizes the credibilistic inventory model developed by Y. Li and Y. Liu in 2019. In our model, the components of demand vector are fuzzy variables and the maximization problem is formulated by using the notion of $m_{\lambda}$-expected value. We shall prove a general formula for the solution of optimization problem, from which we obtained effective formulas for computing the optimal solutions in the particular cases where the demands are trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy numbers. For $\lambda=1/2$ we obtain as a particular case the computation formulas of the optimal solutions of the credibilistic inventory problem of Li and Liu. These computation formulas are applied for some $m_{\lambda}$-models obtained from numerical data.</description>

      <title>A Course in Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are derived from a graduate-level course in dynamic optimization, offering an introduction to techniques and models extensively used in management science, economics, operations research, engineering, and computer science. The course emphasizes the theoretical underpinnings of discrete-time dynamic programming models and advanced algorithmic strategies for solving these models. Unlike typical treatments, it provides a proof for the principle of optimality for upper semi-continuous dynamic programming, a middle ground between the simpler countable state space case \cite{bertsekas2012dynamic}, and the involved universally measurable case \cite{bertsekas1996stochastic}. This approach is sufficiently rigorous to include important examples such as dynamic pricing, consumption-savings, and inventory management models. The course also delves into the properties of value and policy functions, leveraging classical results \cite{topkis1998supermodularity} and recent developments. Additionally, it offers an introduction to reinforcement learning, including a formal proof of the convergence of Q-learning algorithms. Furthermore, the notes delve into policy gradient methods for the average reward case, presenting a convergence result for the tabular case in this context. This result is simple and similar to the discounted case but appears to be new.</description>

      <title>Unimprovable Students and Inequality in School Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Efficiency-Adjusted Deferred Acceptance (EADA) mechanism corrects the Pareto-inefficiency of the celebrated Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm by assigning every student to a weakly more preferred school. However, it remains uncertain which and how many students do not see an improvement in their DA placement under EADA. We show that, despite its advantages, EADA does not benefit students assigned to their worst-ranked schools or those who remain unmatched under DA. Additionally, it limits the placement improvement of marginalized students, thereby maintaining school segregation. The placement of worst-off students under EADA can be exceptionally poor, even though significantly more egalitarian allocations are possible. Lastly, we provide a bound on the expected number of unimproved students using a random market approach valid for small markets. Our findings shed light on why EADA fails to mitigate the inequality produced by DA in empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>On Connected Strongly-Proportional Cake-Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of fairly dividing a divisible heterogeneous resource, also known as a cake, among a set of agents who may have different entitlements. We characterize the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation -- one in which every agent receives a contiguous piece worth strictly more than their proportional share. The characterization is supplemented with an algorithm that determines its existence using O(n * 2^n) queries. We devise a simpler characterization for agents with strictly positive valuations and with equal entitlements, and present an algorithm to determine the existence of such an allocation using O(n^2) queries. We provide matching lower bounds in the number of queries for both algorithms. When a connected strongly-proportional allocation exists, we show that it can also be computed using a similar number of queries. We also consider the problem of deciding the existence of a connected allocation of a cake in which each agent receives a piece worth a small fixed value more than their proportional share, and the problem of deciding the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation of a pie.</description>
