      <title>Adiabatic State Preparation in a Quantum Ising Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on adiabatic state preparation in the one-dimensional quantum Ising model using ultracold bosons in a tilted optical lattice. We prepare many-body ground states of controllable system sizes and observe enhanced fluctuations around the transition between paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, marking the precursor of quantum critical behavior. Furthermore, we find evidence for superpositions of domain walls and study their effect on the many-body ground state by measuring the populations of each spin configuration across the transition. These results shed new light on the effect of boundary conditions in finite-size quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic modulation of driving protocols in periodically driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on/off. We examine how this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems. By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled, we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this approach to a rigid rotor, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that interacts with the rotor's spin. We study the emergence of $\textit{diabolical points}$ and $\textit{diabolical loci}$ in the parameter space of the effective Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique to tune the topological properties of the eigenstates by selecting various adiabatic evolution of the driving protocol characterized by different paths in the parameter space. This technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable topological effects.</description>

      <title>Restoring the topological edge states in a finite optical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of edge states in a finite optical lattice and show that the boundaries of the lattice play a decisive role for their location in the corresponding energy spectrum. We introduce a simple parametrisation of the boundaries of the optical lattice and demonstrate the existence of an optimal choice of the values of the parameters which lead to an approximate restoration of chiral symmetry. A crucial property of this optimization is the suppression of tunneling between next-nearest neighboring wells of the lattice. This in turn allows the mapping of the optical lattice set-up to a finite SSH model. The topological character of the emerging edge states is discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-S Kitaev model has recently been shown to definitely exhibit topological order with spin liquid ground states for half-integer spin, but could be trivially gapped insulators for integer spin. This interesting "even-odd" effect is largely due to the fermionic (bosonic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for half-integer (integer) spin. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for any spin (both integer and half integer spin), which implies a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state regardless of the value of the spin quantum number. We further study the easy-axis limit of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model which can be solved in a controlled perturbative way and show that it exhibits a gapless QSOL ground state, which can even host a non-Abelian topological order by further considering time-reversal breaking interactions to gap out the Dirac cones of the gapless QSOL.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.08 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. It is suggested that HQDL has relevance to the non-superfluid states of confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems which are semi-Boltzmann-like owing to the suppression of Bosonic correlation.</description>

      <title>Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Strongly anisotropic vortices in dipolar quantum droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct strongly anisotropic quantum droplets with embedded vorticity in the 3D space, with mutually perpendicular vortex axis and polarization of atomic magnetic moments. Stability of these anisotropic vortex quantum droplets (AVQDs) is verified by means of systematic simulations. Their stability area is identified in the parametric plane of the total atom number and scattering length of the contact interactions. We also construct vortex-antivortex-vortex bound states and find their stability region in the parameter space. The application of a torque perpendicular to the vorticity axis gives rise to robust intrinsic oscillations or rotation of the AVQDs. The effect of three-body losses on the AVQD stability is considered too. The results show that the AVQDs can retain the topological structure (vorticity) for a sufficiently long time if the scattering length exceeds a critical value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interaction and confinement in a curved geometry by means of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which allows us to characterize the ground state of a dipolar Bose gas under the confinement of a bubble trapping potential. We do so in terms of the scattering length a and the number of particles. We observe the emergence of a wide variety of dipolar solids, consisting on arrangements of different number of droplets along a ring over the equator of the spherical shell confinement. We also show that the transition between the different phases of the system can be engineered by varying a, the number of particles or the radius of the trap, parameters which can be experimentally tuned. Finally, we show the importance of working in microgravity conditions as gravity unstabilizes the observed dipolar solids.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo for Dilute Neutrons on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ constrained path Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) in the pursuit of studying physical nuclear systems using a lattice formalism. Since AFQMC has been widely used in the study of condensed-matter systems such as the Hubbard model, we benchmark our method against published results for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard model calculations. We then turn our attention to cold-atomic and nuclear systems. We use an onsite contact interaction that can be tuned in order to reproduce the known scattering length and effective range of a given interaction. Developing this machinery allows us to extend our calculations to study nuclear systems within a lattice formalism. We perform initial calculations for a range of nuclear systems from two- to few-body neutron systems.</description>
