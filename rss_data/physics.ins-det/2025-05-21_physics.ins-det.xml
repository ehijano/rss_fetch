      <title>Particle identification in the GlueX detector using a multi-layer perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons. This approach offers an exciting opportunity to uncover underlying correlations among PID variables in the reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that an MLP can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo (MC) simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.</description>

      <title>A High-Flux Electron Detector System to Measure Non-linear Compton Scattering at LUXE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, advancements in high-intensity laser technology have enabled the exploration of non-perturbative Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in strong-field regimes. Notable aspects include non-linear Compton scattering and Breit-Wheeler pair production, observable when colliding high-intensity laser pulses and relativistic electron beams. The LUXE experiment at DESY and the E-320 experiment at SLAC aim to study these phenomena by measuring the created high-flux Compton electrons and photons. We propose a novel detector system featuring a segmented gas-filled Cherenkov detector with a scintillator screen and camera setup, designed to efficiently detect high-flux Compton electrons. Preliminary results from E-320 measurement campaigns demonstrate methods for reconstructing electron energy spectra, aiming to reveal crucial features of non-perturbative QED.</description>

      <title>The CRAB facility at the TU Wien TRIGA reactor: status and related physics program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CRAB (Calibrated nuclear Recoils for Accurate Bolometry) project aims to precisely characterize the response of cryogenic detectors to sub-keV nuclear recoils of direct interest for coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter search experiments. The CRAB method relies on the radiative capture of thermal neutrons in the target detector, resulting in a nuclear recoil with a well-defined energy. We present a new experimental setup installed at the TRIGA Mark-II reactor at Atominstitut (Vienna), providing a low intensity beam of thermal neutrons sent to the target cryogenic detector mounted inside a wet dilution refrigerator Kelvinox 100. A crown of BaF$_2$ detectors installed outside the dewar enables coincident detection of the high-energy $\gamma$ escaping the target crystal after neutron capture. After the presentation of all components of the setup we report the analysis of first commissioning data with a CaWO$_4$ detector of the \NUCLEUS experiment. They show stable operation of the cryostat and detectors on a week-scale. Due to an energy resolution currently limited to 20 eV we use neutron beam induced events at high energy, in the 10 to 100 keV range, to demonstrate the excellent agreement between the data and simulation and the accurate understanding of external background. Thanks to these data we also propose an updated decay scheme of the low-lying excited states of $^{187}$W. Finally, we present the first evidence of neutron-capture induced coincidences between $\gamma$-detectors and a cryogenic detector. These promising results pave the way for an extensive physics program with various detector materials, like CaWO$_4$, Al$_2$O$_3$, Ge and Si.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Machine Learning Approach for Nanometric Axial Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Error-Free Demodulation of Pixelated Interferograms: Updated review and circumstantial evidence of plagiarism by 4D Technology Corporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the historical development that led to error-free phase demodulation of pixelated spatial-carrier interferograms between 2004 and 2010. It also evaluates evidence suggesting that 4D Technology Corporation (4DTC), in their SPIE 7790 publication [18], may have adopted key concepts from a manuscript submitted by Servin and collaborators, which at that time was still under peer review [17]. We analyze 4DTC algorithms based on 2x2 and 3x3 spatial convolution phase shifting methods (SC-PSA), developed from 2004 to 2009 [9-15], and show that they were fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidth fringe demodulation. Notably, only one 4DTC paper [13] acknowledged major phase errors when these methods were applied to wideband pixelated fringes, but the problem remained unsolved. In 2010, the team at Centro de Investigaciones en Optica (CIO), led by Servin, entered the field [16,17]. At that point, CIO and 4DTC were the only two known groups pursuing error free demodulation of wideband pixelated interferograms. In June 2010, Servin et al submitted to Optics Express [17] the error free solution introducing a new method: the complex fringe-carrier product followed by step-edge low-pass Fourier filtering. This approach fully superseded the 2x2 and 3x3 SC-PSAs used by 4DTC [9-15], reaching the theoretical slope limit for pixelated sensors. Given that 4DTC paper [18] was presented just seven weeks after Servin submission [17], and only these two groups were working on this problem, it is plausible that 4DTC or an affiliate had early access to the submission. The circumstantial evidence suggests that core ideas from [17] were incorporated into 4DTC August presentation [18]. This paper retraces that scientific path and examines the ethical implications of uncredited appropriation in optical research.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment to neutrino oscillation parameters using acceleration neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the analysis to estimate the sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment to long-baseline neutrino oscillation parameters using accelerator (anti)neutrinos. Results are presented for the CPV discovery sensitivity and precision measurements of the oscillation parameters $\delta_{CP}$, $\sin^2\theta_{23}$, $\Delta m^2_{32}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{13}$. With the assumed Hyper-Kamiokande running plan, a $5\sigma$ CPV discovery is possible in less than three years in the case of maximal CPV and known MO.In the absence of external constraints on the MO, considering the MO sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande measurement using atmospheric neutrinos, the time for a CPV discovery could be estimated to be around six years. Using the nominal final exposure of $27 \times 10^{21}$ protons on target, corresponding to 10 years, with a ratio of 1:3 in neutrino to antineutrino beam mode, we expect to select approximately 10000 charged current, quasi-elastic-like, muon neutrino events, and a similar number of muon anti-neutrino events. In the electron (anti)neutrino appearance channels, we expect approximately 2000 charged current, quasi-elastic-like electron neutrino events and 800 electron antineutrino events. These larges event samples will allow Hyper-Kamiokande to exclude CP conservation at the $5\sigma$significance level for over 60% of the possible true values of $\delta_{CP}$.</description>

      <title>Robust and compact single-lens crossed-beam optical dipole trap for Bose-Einstein condensation in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel concept for a compact and robust crossed-beam optical dipole trap (cODT) based on a single lens, designed for the efficient generation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) under dynamic conditions. The system employs two independent two-dimensional acousto-optical deflectors (AODs) in combination with a single high-numerical-aperture lens to provide three-dimensional control over the trap geometry, minimizing potential misalignments and ensuring long-term operational stability. By leveraging time-averaged potentials, rapid and efficient evaporative cooling sequences toward BECs are enabled. The functionality of the cODT under microgravity conditions has been successfully demonstrated in the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover, Germany, where the beam intersection was shown to remain stable throughout the microgravity phase of the flight. In addition, the system has been implemented in the sensor head of the INTENTAS project to verify BEC generation. Additional realization of one- and two-dimensional control of arrays of condensates through dynamic trap shaping was achieved. This versatile approach allows for advanced quantum sensing applications in mobile and space-based environments based on all- optical BECs.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Silicon Photomultiplier Photon Detection Efficiency at Liquid Nitrogen Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of individual photons at cryogenic temperatures is of interest to many experiments searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are often deployed in liquid argon or liquid xenon to detect scintillation light either directly or after it has been wavelength-shifted. Maximizing the photon detection efficiency (PDE) of the SiPMs used in these experiments optimizes the sensitivity to new physics; however, the PDEs of commercial SiPMs, although well known at room temperature, are not well characterized at the cryogenic temperatures at which many experiments operate them. Here we present results from an experimental setup that measures the photon detection efficiencies of silicon photomultipliers at liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K. Results from a KETEK PM3325-WB-D0 and a Hamamatsu S13360-3050CS silicon photomultiplier - of R&amp;D interest to the LEGEND experiment - exhibit a decrease in photon detection efficiency greater than 20% at liquid nitrogen temperature relative to room temperature for 562 nm light.</description>

      <title>A High Compression Ratio Channel Multiplexing Method for Micro-pattern Gaseous Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for a large number of readout channels has been a limiting factor for the application of Micro-pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) in achieving higher spatial resolution and larger detection areas. This challenge is further compounded by issues related to system integration, power consumption, and cost efficiency. To address these challenges, this study proposes two novel multiplexing methods based on Eulerian circuits. Mathematical calculations indicate that with $n$ electronics channels, up to $n \times (n-1)/2 - (n - 2)/2 + 1$ detector channels can be read out, where $n$ is even. Three types of multiplexing circuits were designed, implemented, and tested in combination with Micromegas detectors. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a multiplexing circuit with a factor of 8, the spatial resolution remains comparable to the direct readout method, while achieving a detection efficiency exceeding 94\%. For a circuit with a multiplexing factor of 16, although the spatial resolution shows a slight degradation, the detection efficiency remains above 93.6\%. These results demonstrate that the proposed multiplexing methods can significantly reduce the number of readout channels while maintaining an acceptable level of spatial resolution and detection efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed multiplexing techniques for applications in fields requiring high-resolution and cost-effective detector systems, such as cosmic-ray muon imaging.</description>

      <title>Trikarenos: Design and Experimental Characterization of a Fault-Tolerant 28nm RISC-V-based SoC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RISC-V-based fault-tolerant system-on-chip (SoC) designs are critical for the new generation of automotive and space SoC architectures. However, reliability assessment requires characterization under controlled radiation doses to accurately quantify the fault tolerance of the fabricated designs. This work analyzes the Trikarenos design, a SoC implemented in TSMC 28nm, for single event upset (SEU) vulnerability under atmospheric neutron and 200 MeV proton radiation, comparing these results to simulation-based fault injection. All faults in error correction codes (ECC) protected memory are corrected by a scrubber, showing an estimated cross-section per bit of up to $1.09 \times 10^{-14}$ cm$^2$ bit$^{-1}$. Furthermore, the triple-core lockstep (TCLS) mechanism implemented in Trikarenos is validated and is shown to correct errors affecting a cross-section up to $3.23 \times 10^{-11}$ cm$^2$, with the remaining uncorrectable vulnerability below $5.36 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^2$. When augmenting the experimental analysis of fabricated chips with gate-level fault injection in simulation, 99.10 % of injections into the SoC produced correct results, while 100 % of injections in the TCLS-protected cores were handled correctly. With 12.28 % of all injected faults leading to a TCLS recovery, this indicates an approximate effective flip-flop cross-section of up to $1.28 \times 10^{-14}$ cm$^2$/FF.</description>

      <title>Antimatter Annihilation Vertex Reconstruction with Deep Learning for ALPHA-g Radial Time Projection Chamber</title>

Abstract: The ALPHA-g experiment at CERN aims to precisely measure the terrestrial gravitational acceleration of antihydrogen atoms. A radial Time Projection Chamber (rTPC), that surrounds the ALPHA-g magnetic trap, is employed to determine the annihilation location, called the vertex. The standard approach requires identifying the trajectories of the ionizing particles in the rTPC from the location of their interaction in the gas (spacepoints), and inferring the vertex positions by finding the point where those trajectories (helices) pass closest to one another. In this work, we present a novel approach to vertex reconstruction using an ensemble of models based on the PointNet deep learning architecture. The newly developed model, PointNet Ensemble for Annihilation Reconstruction (PEAR), directly learns the relation between the location of the vertices and the rTPC spacepoints, thus eliminating the need to identify and fit the particle tracks. PEAR shows strong performance in reconstructing vertical vertex positions from simulated data, that is superior to the standard approach for all metrics considered. Furthermore, the deep learning approach can reconstruct the vertical vertex position when the standard approach fails.</description>

      <title>LArTPC hit-based topology classification with quantum machine learning and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to separate track-like and shower-like topologies in liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments for neutrino physics using quantum machine learning. Effective reconstruction of neutrino events in LArTPCs requires accurate and granular information about the energy deposited in the detector. These energy deposits can be viewed as 2-D images. Simulated data from the MicroBooNE experiment and a simple custom dataset are used to perform pixel-level classification of the underlying particle topology. Images of the events have been studied by creating small patches around each pixel to characterise its topology based on its immediate neighbourhood. This classification is achieved using convolution-based learning models, including quantum-enhanced architectures known as quanvolutional neural networks. The quanvolutional networks are extended to symmetries beyond translation. Rotational symmetry has been incorporated into a subset of the models. Quantum-enhanced models perform better than their classical counterparts with a comparable number of parameters but are outperformed by classical models, which contain an order of magnitude more parameters. The inclusion of rotation symmetry appears to benefit only large models and remains to be explored further.</description>

      <title>Development and Characterization of a High-Resolution and High-Sensitivity Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent implementation of a radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher and a multi-step laser resonance ionization technique, our previously developed collinear laser spectroscopy setup has been successfully upgraded into a fully functional collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy system. The new system was fully characterized using a bunched ion beam at 30~keV, during which hyperfine structure spectra of $^{85,87}$Rb isotopes were measured. An overall efficiency exceeding 1:200 (one resonant ion detected for every 200 ions after the RFQ cooler-buncher) was achieved while maintaining a spectral resolution of 100 MHz. Under these conditions, the extracted hyperfine structure parameters and isotope shift for $^{85,87}$Rb show excellent agreement with the literature values. These results demonstrate the system's capability to perform high-resolution and high-sensitivity laser spectroscopy of neutron-rich Rb isotopes, which are expected to be produced at the Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility at a rate of approximately 100 particles per second.</description>

      <title>Adjusting optical cavity birefringence with wavelength tunable laser for axion searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions have attracted attention as promising candidates for dark matter (DM). Although axions have been intensively searched for, they have not been observed yet. Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that use optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by the axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity composed of four mirrors. However, its sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ in the low axion mass region is limited due to a reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the sensitivity using zero-phase shift mirrors and a wavelength tunable laser. Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high axion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. We experimentally confirmed that the phase difference generated upon reflection on a zero phase shift mirror satisfies the requirement of $8.6 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{deg}$, which corresponds to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the p-polarization with the mirror fixed on a folded cavity and a wavelength tunable laser.</description>
