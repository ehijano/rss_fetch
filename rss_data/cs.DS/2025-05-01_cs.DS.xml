      <title>The Complexity of Minimum-Envy House Allocation Over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalization of the House Allocation problem. In our problem, agents are represented by vertices of a graph $\GG_{\mathcal{A}} = (\AA, E_\AA)$, and each agent $a \in \AA$ is associated with a set of preferred houses $\PP_a \subseteq \HH$, where $\AA$ is the set of agents and $\HH$ is the set of houses. A house allocation is an injective function $\phi: \AA \rightarrow \HH$, and an agent $a$ envies a neighbour $a' \in N_{\GG_\AA}(a)$ under $\phi$ if $\phi(a) \notin \PP_a$ and $\phi(a') \in \PP_a$. We study two natural objectives: the first problem called \ohaa, aims to compute an allocation that minimizes the number of envious agents; the second problem called \ohaah aims to maximize, among all minimum-envy allocations, the number of agents who are assigned a house they prefer. These two objectives capture complementary notions of fairness and individual satisfaction.
  We design polynomial time algorithms for both problems for the variant when each agent prefers exactly one house. On the other hand, when the list of preferred houses for each agent has size at most $2$ then we show that both problems are \NP-hard even when the agent graph $\GG_\AA$ is a complete bipartite graph. We also show that both problems are \NP-hard even when the number $|\mathcal H|$ of houses is equal to the number $|\mathcal A|$ of agents. This is in contrast to the classical {\sc House Allocation} problem, where the problem is polynomial time solvable when $|\mathcal H| = |\mathcal A|$. The two problems are also \NP-hard when the agent graph has a small vertex cover. On the positive side, we design exact algorithms that exploit certain structural properties of $\GG_{\AA}$ such as sparsity, existence of balanced separators or existence of small-sized vertex covers, and perform better than the naive brute-force algorithm.</description>

      <title>New Distributed Interactive Proofs for Planarity: A Matter of Left and Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new distributed interactive proofs (DIP) for planarity and related graph families. The notion of a \emph{distributed interactive proof} (DIP) was introduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In this setting, the verifier consists of $n$ nodes connected by a communication graph $G$. The prover is a single entity that communicates with all nodes by short messages. The goal is to verify that the graph $G$ satisfies a certain property (e.g., planarity) in a small number of rounds, and with a small communication bound, denoted as the \emph{proof size}.
  Prior work by Naor, Parter and Yogev (SODA 2020) presented a DIP for planarity that uses three interaction rounds and a proof size of $O(\log n)$. Feuilloley et al.\ (PODC 2020) showed that the same can be achieved with a single interaction round and without randomization, by providing a proof labeling scheme with a proof size of $O(\log n)$. In a subsequent work, Bousquet, Feuilloley, and Pierron (OPODIS 2021) achieved the same bound for related graph families such as outerplanarity, series-parallel graphs, and graphs of treewidth at most $2$. In this work, we design new DIPs that use exponentially shorter proofs compared to the state-of-the-art bounds.</description>

      <title>On the Space Complexity of Online Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete convolution streaming problem. An input arrives as a stream of numbers $z = (z_0,z_1,z_2,\ldots)$, and at time $t$ our goal is to output $(Tz)_t$ where $T$ is a lower-triangular Toeplitz matrix. We focus on space complexity; the algorithm can store a buffer of $\beta(t)$ numbers in order to achieve this goal.
  We characterize space complexity when algorithms perform algebraic operations. The matrix $T$ corresponds to a generating function $G(x)$. If $G(x)$ is rational of degree $d$, then it is known that the space complexity is at most $O(d)$. We prove a corresponding lower bound; the space complexity is at least $\Omega(d)$. In addition, for irrational $G(x)$, we prove that the space complexity is infinite. We also provide finite-time guarantees. For example, for the generating function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ that was studied in various previous works in the context of differentially private continual counting, we prove a sharp lower bound on the space complexity; at time $t$, it is at least $\Omega(t)$.</description>

      <title>The Planted Orthogonal Vectors Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the $k$-Orthogonal Vectors ($k$-OV) problem we are given $k$ sets, each containing $n$ binary vectors of dimension $d=n^{o(1)}$, and our goal is to pick one vector from each set so that at each coordinate at least one vector has a zero. It is a central problem in fine-grained complexity, conjectured to require $n^{k-o(1)}$ time in the worst case.
  We propose a way to \emph{plant} a solution among vectors with i.i.d. $p$-biased entries, for appropriately chosen $p$, so that the planted solution is the unique one. Our conjecture is that the resulting $k$-OV instances still require time $n^{k-o(1)}$ to solve, \emph{on average}.
  Our planted distribution has the property that any subset of strictly less than $k$ vectors has the \emph{same} marginal distribution as in the model distribution, consisting of i.i.d. $p$-biased random vectors. We use this property to give average-case search-to-decision reductions for $k$-OV.</description>

      <title>Success probability in Shor's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to determine the exact success probability at each step of Shor's algorithm. Although the literature usually provides a lower bound on this probability, we present an improved bound. The derived formulas enable the identification of all failure cases in Shor's algorithm, which correspond to a success probability of zero. A simulation routine is provided to evaluate the theoretical success probability for a given integer when its prime factorization is known with potential applications in quantum resource estimation and algorithm benchmarking.</description>

      <title>On estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$, defined via the Schatten $\alpha$-norm $\|A\|_{\alpha} = \mathrm{tr}(|A|^{\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$, given $\operatorname{poly}(n)$-size state-preparation circuits of $n$-qubit quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$. This quantity serves as a lower bound on the trace distance for $\alpha &gt; 1$. For any constant $\alpha &gt; 1$, we develop an efficient rank-independent quantum estimator for ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(n)$, achieving an exponential speedup over the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024). Our improvement leverages efficiently computable uniform polynomial approximations of signed positive power functions within quantum singular value transformation, thereby eliminating the dependence on the rank of the quantum states.
  Our quantum algorithm reveals a dichotomy in the computational complexity of the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem with Schatten $\alpha$-norm (QSD$_{\alpha}$), which involves deciding whether ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ is at least $2/5$ or at most $1/5$. This dichotomy arises between the cases of constant $\alpha &gt; 1$ and $\alpha=1$:
  - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq \alpha \leq O(1)$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete.
  - For any $1 \leq \alpha \leq 1+\frac{1}{n}$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete, implying that no efficient quantum estimator for $\mathrm{T}_\alpha(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ exists unless $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QSZK}$.
  The hardness results follow from reductions based on new rank-dependent inequalities for the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance with $1\leq \alpha \leq \infty$, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Minimizing $\ell_2$ Norm of Flow Time by Starvation Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assessment of a job's Quality of Service (QoS) often revolves around its flow time, also referred to as response time. This study delves into two fundamental objectives for scheduling jobs: the average flow time and the maximum flow time. While the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm minimizes average flow time, it can result in job starvation, causing certain jobs to experience disproportionately long and unfair flow times. In contrast, the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) algorithm minimizes the maximum flow time but may compromise the average flow time.
  To strike a balance between these two objectives, a common approach is to minimize the $\ell_2$ norm of flow time. SRPT and FCFS are $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$-competitive for this problem, where $n$ is the number of jobs. Prior to this work, no algorithm is known to achieve a competitive ratio better than SRPT and FCFS. In this paper, we use FCFS to mitigate the starvation caused by SRPT. Given a good estimate of $n$, we prove that this approach achieves a much better competitive ratio of $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$. Our results provide the first theoretical evidence that mitigating starvation in SRPT leads to a provable improvement in scheduling performance.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Even-Cycle Detection in Broadcast CONGEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for every $k\geq 2$, $C_{2k}$-freeness can be decided in $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds in the Broadcast CONGEST model, by a deterministic algorithm. This (deterministic) round-complexity is optimal for $k=2$ up to logarithmic factors thanks to the lower bound for $C_4$-freeness by Drucker et al. [PODC 2014], which holds even for randomized algorithms. Moreover it matches the round-complexity of the best known randomized algorithms by Censor-Hillel et al. [DISC 2020] for $k\in\{3,4,5\}$, and by Fraigniaud et al. [PODC 2024] for $k\geq 6$. Our algorithm uses parallel BFS-explorations with deterministic selections of the set of paths that are forwarded at each round, in a way similar to what was done for the detection of odd-length cycles, by Korhonen and Rybicki [OPODIS 2017]. However, the key element in the design and analysis of our algorithm is a new combinatorial result bounding the "local density" of graphs without $2k$-cycles, which we believe is interesting on its own.</description>
