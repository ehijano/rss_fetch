      <title>Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry in Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.</description>

      <title>Universal Wilson loop Bound of Quantum Geometry: $Z_2$ Bound and Physical Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the quantum metric, and provides an explicit lower bound of the quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below, and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</description>

      <title>Effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic motion of Weyl fermions in $^3$He-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of $^3$He-A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He-A-phase in the non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space which may be replaced by one featuring a fermionic theory with a real valued vierbein, two Abelian gauge fields and a spin connection mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of the pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamical quantities of the normal component are analysed.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional moir\'{e} phonon polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid modes combining lattice dynamics and electromagnetic waves. Their behavior at long wavelengths is effectively described by Huang's equations. Here, we investigate phonon polaritons within 2D materials featuring twisted moir\'{e} structures. The interaction between electromagnetic waves and phonons of varying wavelengths gives rise to rich polaritons with moir\'{e} characteristics. We observe the polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of moir\'{e} polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response, offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Spin waves in magnetic nanodisks, nanorings, and 3D nanovolcanoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterned magnetic nanostructures are advanced materials characterized by their unique magnetic properties at the nanoscale, which are the result of tailored geometric configurations and compositional engineering. As interest in nanotechnology continues to grow exponentially, the exploration of patterned magnetic nanostructures turns into a vibrant and critical area of study for both industry professionals and academic researchers. Here, we review investigations of standing spin waves (collective spin precessions) in magnetic elements by the technique of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The presentation encompasses earlier studies of arrays of magnetic nanodisks and nanoringes by cavity-based FMR as well as more recent studies of individual nanodisks and 3D nanovolcanoes by a broadband FMR method which implies the use of a coplanar waveguide. Overall, the manuscript outlines the development of FMR studies along the two major lines: (i) downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic nanoelements and (ii) extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.</description>

      <title>Density of electronic states in density-wave compounds with imperfect nesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of imperfect nesting in a simple 2D tight-binding model on the electronic properties in the density-wave (DW) state. The discussed model reflects the main features of quasi-1D metals, where the DW emerges. We show that an imperfect nesting leads to unusual singularities in the quasi-particle density of states, leading to a strong renormalization of the superconducting critical temperature. We also compute the conductivity tensor of the normal state and obtain a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data on rare-earth tritellurides and many other DW materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonreciprocal transverse localization of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moir\'e photonic lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is derived from the moir\'e structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case, because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.</description>

      <title>Cavity-mediated hybridization of several molecules in the strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular complexes are held together via a variety of bonds, but they all share the common feature that their individual entities are in contact. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate the concept of a \textit{molecular optical bond}, resulting from the far-field electromagnetic coupling of several molecules via a shared mode of an optical microcavity. We discuss a collective enhancement of the vacuum Rabi splitting and study super- and sub-radiant states that arise from the cavity-mediated coupling both in the resonant and dispersive regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-photon transition that emerges between the ground and excited states of the new optical compound. Our experimental data are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and open the door to the realization of hybrid light-matter materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</description>

      <title>Braiding rule of boundary Majorana-like zero mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of topological states has become an important topic in both solid-state systems and artificial structures such as photonic crystals and phononic crystals. Among them, Majorana zero modes, which exhibit nontrivial braiding process, have attracted extensive research interest. The analog of Majorana zero modes in classical waves, or the Majorana-like zero modes (MLZMs), have also got a lot of attention recently. However, the vast majority of previous works concerned with MLZMs that were bounded to vortexes inside the bulk. Here in this work, we unveil the braiding rule of MLZMs that are tunable around the boundary of a vortex-texture Kekule modulated graphene. We show that the existence of these zero-dimensional boundary MLZMs is protected by the Zak phase of 1D boundary states. As such, we are able to construct multiple MLZMs and analyze the corresponding braiding process. In addition, we also provide an implementation scheme of the boundary MLZMs in acoustic crystals. The tunability of the boundary MLZMs proposed herein offer new freedom for topological states braiding in both solid-state systems and artificial structures.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Spin Hall Magnetoresistance from Spin Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), the variation in resistance in a heavy metal (HM) with the magnetization orientation of an adjacent ferromagnet (FM), has been extensively studied as a powerful tool for probing surface magnetic moments in a variety of magnetic materials. However, the conventional SMR theory assumes rigid magnetization of a fixed magnitude, an assumption that breaks down close to the FM's Curie temperature \(T_c\), where the magnetic susceptibility diverges. Here, we report an unconventional SMR effect arising from the magnetic-field modulation of spin fluctuations in the FM, while its magnetization remaining collinear to the spin Hall accumulation in the HM. In contrast to the conventional SMR, which scales with the magnetization and vanishes near $T_{c}$, such ``longitudinal" SMR (LSMR), though suppressed at low temperatures, becomes critically enhanced at \(T_c\), reaching a magnitude comparable to conventional SMR amplitudes. Our findings suggest a promising method for electrically detecting enhanced spin fluctuations in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral induced Spin Polarized Electron Current: Origin of the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect has provided a novel tool to study how active physical and chemical mechanism may differ in chiral enantiomers, however, the origin of the effect itself is yet an open question. In this article, it is theoretically shown that two aspects have to be fulfilled for the chiral induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First, chirality is a necessary condition for breaking spin-degeneracy in molecular structures that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is indispensable for the molecule to develop a non-vanishing spin-polarization. These theoretical conclusions are illustrated in terms of a few examples, showing the necessity of the two aspects to be coordinated for the emergence of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Raman scattering and lattice orientation identification of 2M-WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic materials with low symmetries hold significant promise for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. 2M-WS2, a candidate for topological superconductivity, has garnered considerable interest. However, a comprehensive understanding of how its anisotropic features contribute to unconventional superconductivity, along with a simple, reliable method to identify its crystal orientation, remains elusive. Here, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate angle- and polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman modes of 2M-WS2. Through first-principles calculations, we predict and analyze phonon dispersion and lattice vibrations of all Raman modes in 2M-WS2. We establish a direct correlation between their anisotropic Raman spectra and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, we demonstrate that anisotropic Raman spectroscopy can accurately determine the crystal orientation and twist angle between two stacked 2M-WS2 layers. Our findings provide insights into the electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic properties of 2M-WS2, paving the way for the use of anisotropic materials in advanced electronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Magnon Excitations and Switching in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how spatiotemporal spin polarized current can lead to terahertz frequency excitations in non-collinear antiferromagnets. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically for non-collinear antiferromagnet, we show that the magnon frequency spectrum exhibits standing spin wave modes and depends on the thickness of Mn$_3$Ge in heterostructure Fe|Au|Mn$_3$Ge. Also, we analyze the switching process of ground state as a function of a spin current. We show a switching phase diagram, which contains switching and non-switching regions. Our work suggests non-collinear antiferromagnets as an efficient platform for terahertz magnonics and ultrafast memory devices.</description>

      <title>Formation of Magnonic Waveguides via Surface Anisotropy-Induced Bragg Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with designing magnonic waveguides and propose a novel type with promising properties. Specifically, we study a magnonic waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) through surface anisotropy applied in stripe regions, creating Bragg mirror structures. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while avoiding static demagnetizing effects. Using finite element simulations, we calculate the dispersion relation of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we evaluate the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.</description>

      <title>Momentum tunnelling between nanoscale liquid flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world of nanoscales in fluidics is the frontier where the continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic, and even quantum, nature of matter. While water dynamics remains largely classical under extreme confinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling between water transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confining materials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic flows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin to condensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination of many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquid can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at odds with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that the range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's electronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at resonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling is expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic networks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It further suggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls for manipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature and characteristics of individual molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system of a qubit and a magnon mode in which the qubit is weakly driven. We demonstrate that the spectral steady-state responses of both the qubit and the magnon show, in addition to two sidebands split by the coupling, also a peak at the driving frequency with virtually zero linewidth. This phenomenon, which persists at both strong and weak coupling, is an analog of the Heitler effect in atomic physics, and shows the path towards building of coherent magnon sources.</description>

      <title>Transport Signatures of Inverted Andreev Bands in Topological Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermoelectrical transport transverse to conventional and topological Josephson junctions with a central quantum dot (QD). For that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.</description>

      <title>Launching Focused and Spatially Confined Phonon-Polaritons in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Launching and focusing phonon-polaritons present novel opportunities for low-loss guiding of subdiffractionally confined light at the nanoscale. Despite significant efforts to improve control in polaritonic media, focused and spatially confined phonon-polariton waves have only been achieved in the in-plane anisotropic crystals (such as MoO$_3$) and remain elusive in the in-plane isotropic crystals (such as hexagonal boron nitride). In this study, we present a previously unexplored approach to launching phonon-polaritons by employing hBN subwavelength resonators coupled to gold nanoantennas. The integration of gold nanoantennas enables efficient coupling to the far-field component of mid-infrared light, while the geometry of the resonators defines the wavefront curvature, spatial confinement, and focusing of the launched polaritons. Using standard lithographic protocols, we achieve strong field enhancement and resonant mode localization, generating phonon-polaritons with precise spatial definition. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy reveals the real-space optical contrast of these modes. This innovative and practical approach introduces a new paradigm for fabricating nanoresonators that actively launch and focus phonon-polaritons, opening avenues for advanced nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral electronic network within skyrmionic lattice on topological insulator surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a proximity effect between Dirac surface states of a topological insulator and the skyrmion phase of an insulating magnet. A single skyrmion results in the surface states having a chiral gapless mode confined to the perimeter of the skyrmion. For the lattice of skyrmions, the tunneling coupling between confined states leads to the formation of low energy bands delocalized across the whole system. We show that the structure of these bands can be investigated with the help of the phenomenological chiral network model with a kagome lattice geometry. While the network model by itself can be in a chiral Floquet phase unattainable without external periodic driving, we show how to use a procedure known as band reconstruction to obtain the low energy bands of the electrons on the surface of the topological insulator for which there is no external driving. We conclude that band reconstruction is essential for the broad class of network models recently introduced to describe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid in the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multimethod investigation into the nature of the recently reported quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. A comprehensive projective symmetry group classification of fermionic mean-field Ans\"atze on this lattice yields 46 U(1) and 80 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ states. Motivated by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations suggesting that the Shastry-Sutherland model and the square-lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet putatively share the same QSL phase, we establish a mapping of our Ans\"atze to those of the square lattice. This enables us to identify the equivalent of the square-lattice QSL (Z2A$zz$13) in the Shastry-Sutherland system. Employing state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon by Lanczos steps, we demonstrate the excellent agreement of energies and correlators between a gapless (Dirac) $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid -- characterized by only few parameters -- and approaches based on neural quantum states and DMRG. Furthermore, the real-space spin-spin correlations are shown to decay with the same power law as in the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ square lattice model, which also hosts a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. Finally, we apply the recently developed Keldysh formulation of the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group to compute the dynamical spin structure factor; these correlations exhibit the features expected due to Dirac cones in the excitation spectrum, thus providing strong independent evidence for a Dirac QSL ground state. Our finding of a $d$-wave pairing $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac QSL is consistent with the recently observed signatures of QSL behavior in Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ and outlines predictions for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Analytical model of metasurfaces comprising meta-atoms with anisotropic polarizabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.</description>

      <title>Majorana Flat Bands in the Vortex Line of Superconducting Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that there exist Majorana flat bands (MFBs) in the vortex line of superconducting (SC) Weyl semimetals which break time reversal symmetry. Since a Weyl semimetal can be regarded as Chern insulators stacked along one (z) direction, so we decompose the vortex bound states of SC Weyl semimetals into the vortex bound states of SC Chern insulators labelled by kz. After calculating the topological phase diagram of the SC Chern insulators both analytically and numerically, we can explain the appearance of MFBs and determine the exact boundaries of them in SC Weyl semimetals. What's more, tuning the chemical potential or the pairing strength can result in the MFBs along the whole kz axis. Based on the above understanding, we propose a kz-dependent Z2 Chern-Simons invariant to characterize the MFBs. Finally, if we further consider an attractive Hubbard interaction, the aforementioned SC Weyl semimetal and MFBs can be realized under appropriate parameters.</description>

      <title>Theory of Transient Heat Conduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast and nanoscale heat conduction demands a unified theoretical framework that rigorously bridges macroscopic transport equations with microscopic material properties derived from statistical physics.Existing empirical generalizations of Fourier's law often lack a solid microscopic foundation, failing to connect observed non-Fourier behavior with underlying atomic scale mechanisms. In this work, we present a time-domain theory of transient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's statistical theory of irreversible processes. Central to this framework is the time-domain transport function, Z(t), defined through equilibrium time-correlation functions of heat fluxes. This function generalizes the conventional concept of steady-state thermal conductivity, governing the transition of conduction dynamics from onset second sound type wave propagation at finite speeds to diffusion-dominated behavior across broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike phonon hydrodynamic models that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon drift velocity, our approach provides a quantitative and microscopic description of intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies universally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By integrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with continuum-level macroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust foundation for numerical simulations of transient temperature fields. Furthermore, it facilitates the interpretation and design of transient thermal grating experiments using nanometer-scale heat sources and ultrafast laser systems in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelength ranges, advancing our understanding of heat dissipation dynamics.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes how the ferroelectric properties of cubic-like BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles are affected by different terminations and charge distributions at the surface using ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments. Our findings unveil multiple multidomain configurations and illustrate how the different order parameters evolve towards the surface. Interestingly, for neutral terminations, a non-rhombohedral phase of BiFeO$_3$ with a stripe-like polarization arrangement was stabilized. We evaluate the polarization, oxygen octahedra rotation, and volume variation for all the configurations obtained, taking advantage of the atomic-scale details provided by the methods used in this study.</description>

      <title>Electronic Noise Considerations for Designing Integrated Solid-State Quantum Memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum networks expand and are deployed outside research laboratories, a need arises to design and integrate compact control electronics for each memory node. It is essential to understand the performance requirements for such systems, especially concerning tolerable levels of noise, since these specifications dramatically affect a system's design complexity and cost. Here, using an approach that can be easily generalized across quantum-hardware platforms, we present a case study based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We model and experimentally verify the effects of phase noise and timing jitter in the control system in conjunction with the spin qubit's environmental noise. We further consider the impact of different phase noise characteristics on the fidelity of dynamical decoupling sequences. The results demonstrate a procedure to specify design requirements for integrated quantum control signal generators for solid-state spin qubits, depending on their coherence time, intrinsic noise spectrum, and required fidelity.</description>

      <title>Essentially degenerate hidden nodal lines in two-dimensional magnetic layer groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the theory of group representations, the types of band degeneracy can be divided into accidental degeneracy and essential degeneracy. The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typically resided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, we propose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate but is hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable, dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL is guaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirror symmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic and magnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magnetic layer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirror symmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122 candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstrate spinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror and time-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbital coupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGs have also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical lattice models to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specific electronic fillings in real materials, namely 4$N$+2 in spinless systems (and 2$N$+1 in spinful systems), the presence of the HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of the systems. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations, we further identify possible material candidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinful HENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic of momentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new type of topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study the related physics of HENLs.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of Euler superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a non-trivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a non-trivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topologically quantized jump and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the non-interacting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order nonlinear optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced steady dc currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</description>

      <title>Strain Mediated Voltage Control of Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetization Reversal in Bismuth Substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet Films and Meso-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on magnetic anisotropy modulation in Bismuth substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi-YIG) thin films and mesoscale patterned structures deposited on a PMN-PT substrate with the application of voltage-induced strain. The Bi content is selected for low coercivity and higher magnetostriction than that of YIG, yielding significant changes in the hysteresis loops through the magnetoelastic effect. The piezoelectric substrate is poled along its thickness, which is the [011] direction, by applying a voltage across the PMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (MOKE) shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with voltage-induced strain. Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain state of the Bi-YIG film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90{\deg} switching of the magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The magnetoelectric coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is competitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on ferroelectric substrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT. Voltage-control of magnetization reversal fields in 5-30 microns wide dots and racetracks of Bi-YIG show potential for energy efficient non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin coupling between magnetic metal atoms and organic radicals plays a pivotal role in high-performance magnetic materials. The complex interaction involving multi-spin centers in bulk materials makes it challenging to study spin coupling at the atomic scale. Here, we investigate the $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin interaction in well-defined metal-organic coordinated structures composed of two iron (Fe) atoms and four all-trans retinoic acid (ReA) molecules, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The ReA molecule is turned into a spin-$1/2$ radical state by dehydrogenation, facilitating strong magnetic coupling with the coordinated Fe atoms. Comprehensive theoretical analysis, based on density functional theory and valence bond theory, further elucidates the intrinsic mechanism of ferrimagnetic spin coupling in the coordination structure. Specifically, simultaneous antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe dimer to ReA radicals parallelizes the dimer spin orientation. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of spin interaction in metal-organic coordination structures and provides microscopic insights for designing advanced magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Integrative Learning of Intensity Fluctuations of Quantum Dots under Excitation via a Tailored Mixture Hidden Markov Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.</description>

Abstract: Electrically driven spin resonance is a powerful technique for controlling semiconductor spin qubits. However, it faces challenges in qubit addressability and off-resonance driving in larger systems. We demonstrate coherent bichromatic Rabi control of quantum dot hole spin qubits, offering a spatially selective approach for large qubit arrays. By applying simultaneous microwave bursts to different gate electrodes, we observe multichromatic resonance lines and resonance anticrossings that are caused by the ac Stark shift. Our theoretical framework aligns with experimental data, highlighting interdot motion as the dominant mechanism for bichromatic driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <title>Automated Tabletop Exfoliation and Identification of Monolayer Graphene Flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, graphene has been intensively studied because of its remarkable mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. Initial studies were enabled by manual ``Scotch Tape'' exfoliation; nearly two decades later, this method is still widely used to obtain chemically-pristine flakes of graphene and other 2D van der Waals materials. Unfortunately, the yield of large, pristine flakes with uniform thickness is inconsistent. Thus, significant time and effort are required to exfoliate and locate flakes suitable for fabricating multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we describe a relatively affordable tabletop device (the ``eXfoliator'') that can reproducibly control key parameters and largely automate the exfoliation process. In a typical exfoliation run, the eXfoliator produces 3 or more large ($\ge400\ \mu$m$^2$) high-quality graphene monolayer flakes, allowing new users to produce such flakes at a rate comparable to manual exfoliation by an experienced user. We use an automated mapping system and a computer vision algorithm to locate candidate flakes. Our results provide a starting point for future research efforts to more precisely identify which parameters matter for the success of exfoliation, and to optimize them.</description>

      <title>Spinless topological chirality from Umklapp scattering in twisted 3D structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinless systems exhibit unique topological characteristics compared to spinful ones, stemming from their distinct algebra. Without chiral interactions typically linked to spin, an intriguing yet unexplored interplay between topological and structural chirality may be anticipated. Here we discover spinless topological chiralities solely from structural chiralities that lie in the 3D spatial patterning of structureless units, exemplified using two types of twisted graphite systems. In a 3D screw twisted structure without periodicity in all directions, we find a chiral Weyl semimetal phase where bulk topology and chiral surface states are both determined by the screw direction. And in a 3D periodic structure formed with layer-alternating twist angle signs, a higher-order Dirac semimetal with chiral hinge states is discovered. Underlying these novel topological states is the intervalley Umklapp scattering that captures the chirality of the twisted interfaces, leading effectively to a sign-flipped chiral interlayer hopping, thereby introducing $\pi$-flux Z2 lattice gauge field that alters the symmetry algebra. Our findings point to a new pathway for engineering topological chirality through patterning twisted arrays of featureless units, which can expand the design principles for topological photonics and acoustics.</description>

Abstract: We present the first detailed study of the effect of a strong magnetic field on single-electron pumping in a device utilising a finger-gate split-gate configuration. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field, reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically predict that the motion of a polar crystalline layer between two graphene planes exerts Coulomb drag on electrons in graphene, inducing a DC drag current. The physical mechanism underlying this drag arises from intervalley scattering of charge carriers in graphene caused by the time-dependent potential of the moving crystalline layer. This drag effect manifests above a finite threshold doping of the graphene layers, which is determined by the lattice structure and the relative orientation of the crystalline layer with respect to the graphene lattice. Additionally, the drag current exhibits a nonlinear Hall effect due to the interplay between the induced nonequilibrium pseudospin and the intrinsic pseudospin-orbit coupling in graphene. In turn, the drag exerted on electrons in graphene produces a backaction on the crystalline layer, which can be described as an increase in its dynamic viscosity.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermally induced back-action effects in absorption-sensitive micro- and nanomechanical resonators. We propose a unified approach, enabling to simultaneously address both the effective dynamics and non-equilibrium phononic state, depending on the position of a punctual sensing (and heating) probe at the surface of the mechanical device. We present an analytical solution in terms of green functions for a unidimensional resonator whose thermomechanical deformation profile generally follows that of the mechanical losses. In particular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations strongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum fluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides the first steps towards a thorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their consequences, which may be of significance for future development in ultrasensitive nanomechanical research.</description>

Abstract: We examine the framework of relativistic spin-hydrodynamics in the context of electron hydrodynamics in graphene. We develop a spin-hydrodynamic model for a (2 + 1)-dimensional system of fermions under the condition of small spin polarization. Our analysis confirms that thermal vorticity, which satisfies the global equilibrium condition, is also a solution to the spin-hydrodynamic equations. Additionally, we calculate the magnetization of the system in global equilibrium and introduce a novel phenomenon - thermovortical magnetization - resulting from thermal vorticity, which can be experimentally observed in graphene.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Tuned Metal-Insulator Transition in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals recently discovered in van der Waals structures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. These chiral phonons can emerge under the inversion symmetry breaking introduced by an effective mass imbalance between the two layers or a moir\'e potential in one layer, as well as under the time-reversal symmetry breaking realized by applying a magnetic field. Considering the wide tunability of layered materials, the frequencies and chirality values of phonons can both be tuned by varying the system parameters. These findings suggest that bilayer honeycomb-type Wigner crystals can serve as an exciting new platform for studying chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Evidence of orbital Hall current induced correlation in second harmonic response of longitudinal and transverse voltage in light metal-ferromagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of orbital current arising from orbital Hall effect in thin films of Nb and Ti in ohmic contact with ferromagnetic Ni in the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltages in response to an a.c. current applied to the bilayer structures. Our experiments were analogous to those on Heavy Metal-Ferromagnet bilayers and we extract the Orbital Hall Torque efficiency and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.</description>

      <title>Heavy Hole vs. Light Hole Spin Qubits: A Strain-Driven Study of SiGe/Ge and GeSn/Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</description>

      <title>PyAtoms: An interactive tool for rapidly simulating atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images of 2D materials, moir\'e systems and superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekul\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</description>

      <title>Electrically pumped h-BN single-photon emission in van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we realize a device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon emission using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allow robust and persistent generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect structures of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling and its absence in deep wells and strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.</description>
