      <title>Making sense of negative probabilities: An exact representation of the dynamics of quantum spin chains as classical stochastic processes with particle/antiparticle pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of quantum mechanics, classical probability interpretations have faced significant challenges. A notable issue arises with the emergence of negative probabilities when attempting to define the joint probability of non-commutative observables. In this work, we propose a resolution to this dilemma by introducing an exact representation of the dynamics of quantum spin chains using classical continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). These CTMCs effectively model the creation, annihilation, and propagation of pairs of classical particles and antiparticles. The quantum dynamics then emerges by averaging over various realizations of this classical process.</description>

      <title>Behavior of Ising spins and ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.</description>

      <title>Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.</description>

      <title>Percolation in a three-dimensional non-symmetric multi-color loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the percolation transition of a non-symmetric loop model on a regular three-dimensional lattice. We calculated the critical exponents for the percolation transition of this model. The percolation transition occurs at a temperature that is close to, but not exactly the thermal critical temperature. Our finite-size study on this model yielded a correlation length exponent that agrees with that of the three-dimensional XY model with an error margin of six per cent.</description>

      <title>Instabilities, thermal fluctuations, defects and dislocations in the crystal-$R_I$-$R_{II}$ rotator phase transitions of n-alkanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical study of instabilities, thermal fluctuations, and topological defects in the crystal-rotator-I-rotator-II ($X-R_{I}-R_{II}$) phase transitions of n-alkanes has been conducted. First, we examine the nature of the $R_{I}-R_{II}$ phase transition in nanoconfined alkanes. We propose that under confined conditions, the presence of quenched random orientational disorder makes the $R_{I}$ phase unstable. This disorder-mediated transition falls within the Imry-Ma universality class. Next, we discuss the role of thermal fluctuations in certain rotator phases, as well as the influence of dislocations on the $X-R_I$ phase transition. Our findings indicate that the Herringbone order in the $X$-phase and the Hexatic order in the $R_{II}$-phase exhibit quasi-long-range characteristics. Furthermore, we find that in two dimensions, the unbinding of dislocations does not result in a disordered liquid state.</description>

      <title>Site-Decorated Model for Unconventional Frustrated Magnets with Ultranarrow Phase Crossover and Spin Reversal Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The site-decorated Ising model is introduced to advance the understanding and physical realization of the recently discovered one-dimensional finite-temperature ultranarrow phase crossover in an external magnetic field, overcoming the complexity of the traditional bond-decorated models from geometric consideration. Furthermore, for higher-dimensional Ising models in the presence of an external magnetic field, while they remain unsolved, an exact solution about a novel spin-reversal transition -- accessible by a slight change in temperature or the magnetic field, even in the weak field limit -- is found to exist upon the site decoration. These results suggest a new route to energy-efficient applications in, e.g., data storage and processing, and call for materialization and device design with site decoration in, e.g., mixed $d$-$f$ compounds, optical lattices, or neural networks.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient processes is proposed. Postulating its dependence on temporal derivatives of the equilibrium integrals of motion, non-equilibrium analogues of the thermodynamic relationships are derived and the conditions that maximize the non-equilibrium entropy are identified. A rigorous threshold between ``slow" and ``fast" processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi-equilibrium description. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for finite speed of thermal propagation. Finally, a new expression for the non-equilibrium work is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize large deviation theorems to analyze the distributions of a Bose gas of photons and Planck's identical linear oscillators. By applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cram\'er-Chernoff theorems, we calculate the large deviation probabilities, entropies, and rate functions for the spatial and energy distributions of both photons and Planck's oscillators. Our study reproduces the results of Bose and Planck within the framework of large deviation theory.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty are more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb by employing a mean-field approximation. Further, we explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.</description>

      <title>Efficient evaluation of the nonstabilizerness in unitary and monitored quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the staggered XXZ chain, also focusing on its noninteracting tight-binding limit, and of the SYK model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). To do that we introduce a numerical method to evaluate SRE, more efficient than the brute-force one, based on the expansion of the state restricted to a subspace in the computational basis of the classical spin configurations. In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one where the time-averaged SRE saturates the fully-random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the asymptotic SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the asymptotic SRE linearly increases with the size in all the considered cases.</description>

      <title>Signature of glassy dynamics in dynamic modes decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, e.g., in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study analytically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their characterization. Here, we show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation. The dynamic mode decomposition, which is a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum, thus provides a model-agnostic signature for detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of one-dimensional ODEs and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>SVM/SVR Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels and quantum Green's functions. Drawing on the analogy between margin maximization in SVMs and action extremization in Lagrangian mechanics, we show that many standard kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions and that this correspondence arises from the inversion of physical operators. We further demonstrate how positive semi-definiteness, which is essential for valid SVM kernels, aligns with the spectral properties that ensure well-defined Green's functions.
  We employ the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) to create custom kernels for cases where the commonly employed kernels don't lead to a convergence. These custom kernels approximate the desired Green's functions. We furthermore demonstrate numerically on examples taken from physical problems, such as electrical conductivity, scattering amplitudes, photonic crystals, and energy levels of anharmonic oscillators, that selecting kernel functions that mirror the mathematical form of the associated Green's function can significantly enhance the predictive accuracy of machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Why is the strength of a polymer network so low?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments have long shown that a polymer network of covalent bonds commonly ruptures at a stress that is orders of magnitude lower than the strength of the covalent bonds. Here we investigate this large reduction in strength by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the network ruptures by sequentially breaking a small fraction of bonds, and that each broken bond lies on the minimum "shortest path". The shortest path is the path of the fewest bonds that connect two monomers at the opposite ends of the network. As the network is stretched, the minimum shortest path straightens and bears high tension set by covalent bonds, while most strands off the path deform by entropic elasticity. After a bond on the minimum shortest path breaks, the process repeats for the next minimum shortest path. As the network is stretched and bonds are broken, the scatter in lengths of the shortest paths first narrows, causing stress to rise, and then broadens, causing stress to decline. This sequential breaking of a small fraction of bonds causes the network to rupture at a stress that is orders of magnitude below the strength of the covalent bonds.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetry breaking in a frustration-free spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nearest-neighbor, frustration-free spin $\frac{1}{2}$ chain can be constructed {\it via} projectors of various ranks \'{a} la Bravyi-Gosset. We show that in the rank 1 case this system is gapped and has two ground states resembling ferromagnetic states. These states spontaneously break the non-invertible symmetry connecting them. The latter is proved using the machinery of algebraic quantum theory. The non-invertible symmetries of this system do not come from a duality.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fuel-driven process of replication in living systems generates distributions of copied entities with varying degrees of copying accuracy. Here we introduce a thermodynamically consistent ensemble for investigating universal population features of replicating systems. In the context of copolymer copying, coarse-graining over molecular details, we establish a phase diagram of copying accuracy. We discover sharp non-equilibrium transitions between populations of random and accurate copies. Maintaining a population of accurate copies requires a minimum energy expenditure that depends on the configurational entropy of copolymer sequences.</description>

      <title>Vertex Representation of Hyperbolic Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) for classical spin systems on hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p&gt;4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be used for the lowest-energy quantum states on the hyperbolic lattices.</description>

      <title>Physical meaning of nonextensive term in Massieu functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the significance of nonextensive terms in Massieu functions. Finite-size effects are in many cases dominated by a term proportional to the surface area. Nevertheless, in numerical simulations of finite systems with periodic boundary conditions, the nonextensive term can become the dominant correction to Massieu functions. This paper presents a general approach linking these nonextensive terms to thermodynamic fluctuations, demonstrating that equations of state inherently encode this information. Numerical simulations corroborate our results. The examples used are hard sphere and hard disk fluids and a one-dimensional spin lattice, emphasizing the applicability of the results across different classes of systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-$S$ Ising models with multispin interactions on the one-dimensional chain and two-dimensional square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spin-$S$ Ising models with $p$-spin interactions on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. Here, $S$ denotes the magnitude of the spin and $p$ represents the number of spins involved in each interaction. The analysis is performed for $S=1/2,1,3/2,2$ and $p=3,4,5$. For the one-dimensional model, we formulate transfer matrices, and numerically diagonalize them to analyze the temperature dependence of the free energy and spin-spin correlations. In the case of $S=1/2$, the free energy does not depend on $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are uniformly enhanced across all temperature scales as $p$ increases. In contrast, for $S \geq 1$, the free energy varies with $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are significantly enhanced at lower temperatures as $p$ increases. For the two-dimensional model, by using multicanonical simulations, we analyze physical quantities such as an order parameter, internal energy, and specific heat. In addition, we define and examine an order parameter to distinguish ordered and disordered phases. It is found that a first-order phase transition occurs at finite temperatures for all $S$ and $p\geq3$, and increasing $p$ strengthens its nature. We present $S$ and $p$ dependence of the transition temperature and latent heat, and discuss effects of higher-order interactions on the nature of phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We study nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic theories with charge and energy conservation in and above two dimensions that describe the large-scale behavior of the Hamiltonian XY model in the disordered and ordered phases. Using renormalization group analysis at one-loop order, we show that while Fourier's law holds in the ordered phase above two dimensions and in the disordered phase in any dimension, the energy diffusivity in the ordered phase exactly in two dimensions, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase, exhibits a logarithmic divergence in the thermodynamic limit. This divergence arises from elastic energy transport induced by spin-wave excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the fractional advection-diffusion equation and rare events associated with the ACTRW model. When waiting times have a finite mean but infinite variance, and the displacements follow a narrow distribution, the fractional operator is defined in terms of space rather than time. The far tail of the positional distribution is governed by rare events, which exhibit a different scaling compared to typical fluctuations. Additionally, we establish a strong relationship between the number of renewals and the positional distribution in the context of large deviations. Throughout the manuscript, the theoretical results are validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in a Quantum Point Contact Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free fermion systems is sufficient to "thermalize" a small subsystem in that the subsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of the combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any interactions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only minimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion system) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two 2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC) is examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system is in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the linear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and small subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy $S_A \sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by each additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite size/temperature conformal scaling: $\Delta S_A = \alpha \log{(1/E)\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small number of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical, ergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might affect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties themselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolates between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

Abstract: Recent results have demonstrated that samplers constructed with flow-based generative models are a promising new approach for configuration generation in lattice field theory. In this paper, we present a set of training- and architecture-based methods to construct flow models for targets with multiple separated modes (i.e.~vacua) as well as targets with extended/continuous modes. We demonstrate the application of these methods to modeling two-dimensional real and complex scalar field theories in their symmetry-broken phases. In this context we investigate different flow-based sampling algorithms, including a composite sampling algorithm where flow-based proposals are occasionally augmented by applying updates using traditional algorithms like HMC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Nevertheless, the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly, a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the short-imaginary-time stage is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases. Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <title>Lattice ultrasensitivity amplifies signals in E. coli without fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The E. coli chemosensory lattice, consisting of receptors, kinases, and adaptor proteins, is an important test case for biochemical signal processing. Kinase output is characterized by precise adaptation to a wide range of background ligand levels and large gain in response to small relative changes in concentration. Existing models of this lattice achieve their gain through allosteric interactions between either receptors or core units of receptors and kinases. Here we introduce a model which operates through an entirely different mechanism in which receptors gate inherently far from equilibrium enzymatic reactions between neighboring kinases. Our lattice model achieves gain through a mechanism more closely related to zero-order ultrasensitivity than to allostery. Thus, we call it lattice ultrasensitivity (LU). Unlike other lattice critical models, the LU model can achieve arbitrarily high gain through time-scale separation, rather than through fine-tuning. The model also captures qualitative experimental results which are difficult to reconcile with existing models. We discuss possible implementations in the lattice's baseplate where long flexible linkers could potentially mediate interactions between neighboring core units.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals as AC sensors: enhancements and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as quantum sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of liquid viscosity from unstable localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow, governed by atomic-scale friction between its constituent atoms. While viscosity can be directly computed using the Green-Kubo formalism, its microscopic origin remains poorly understood. In this work, we calculate the viscosity of a $\mathrm{Cu_{50}Zr_{50}}$ metallic liquid and a Kob-Andersen model in a large range of temperatures and compare the results with a theoretical formula based on nonaffine linear response and instantaneous normal mode theory. This analysis reveals that, above approximately the mode-coupling temperature ($T_{\text{MC}}$), unstable localized instantaneous normal modes (ULINMs) control the viscosity, suggesting a microscopic definition of it as diffusive momentum transport facilitated by local structural excitations mediated by ULINMs as precursors. On the other hand, at $ \approx T_{\text{MC}}$, we observe a dynamical crossover below which the viscosity is governed by stable modes. This behavior is compatible with the topological transition that emerges in the potential energy landscape between minima dominated dynamics ($T&lt;T_{\text{MC}}$), corresponding to stable modes, and saddles dominated dynamics ($T&gt;T_{\text{MC}}$), related to unstable ones. Finally, leveraging on the concept of configurational entropy, a quantitative model to connect viscosity with ULINMs is also proposed and validated in both the Arrhenius and non-Arrhenius regimes. In summary, our work provides a microscopic definition of liquid viscosity and highlights the fundamental role of ULINMs as its building blocks, ultimately opening the path to an atomic-scale prediction of viscosity in liquids and glasses.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as the R\'enyi index $n \to 1$ is often believed to yield the von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, earlier findings indicate that this process exhibits a singularity for the colored Motzkin spin chain problem, leading to different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. Our analytical and numerical calculations confirm this transition, which can be explained by the exponentially increasing density of states in the entanglement spectrum that we extract numerically. Disorder operators are further employed under various symmetries to study such a system. Both analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the scaling of the disorder operators also follows $\log{l}$ as the leading behavior, matching that of the R\'enyi entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant shared by both the R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators. This universal constant could potentially help capture the underlying constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>

      <title>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <title>Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.</description>
