      <title>A Compact X-Ray Laser with Ion Source and Crystal Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are renowned for their high brightness, significantly impacting biology, chemistry, and nonlinear X-ray optics. However, current XFELs are large, expensive, and exhibit significant shot-to-shot instability. Here, we propose a novel compact apparatus for generating X-ray lasers. The setup integrates an ion source to produce highly charged ions as the gain medium. The X-ray optical cavity employs crystal Bragg diffraction for high reflectivity at large angles, and two parabolic compound refractive lenses (CRLs) focus the X-rays. Pumping is achieved through electron collision excitations. This X-ray laser offers compact dimensions, reduced costs, and enhanced coherence, positioning it as a promising seed for XFELs. With further optimization, this device has the potential to rival XFELs and revolutionize both scientific research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A Rb-Cs dual-species magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a three-dimensional (3D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) capable of simultaneously capturing 85Rb and 133Cs atoms. Unlike conventional setups, our system utilizes two separate laser systems that are combined before entering the vacuum chamber, enabling the simultaneous trapping of two different atomic species. Additionally, in our 3D MOT configuration, two (of three) pairs of laser beams are not orthogonal to the chamber surfaces but are aligned at a 45{\deg} angle. With a total trapping laser power of 8 mW and repump laser power of 4 mW for Rb atoms, and a total trapping laser power of 7.5 mW and repump laser power of 1.5 mW for Cs atoms, we achieve optical depths (OD) of 3.71 for Rb and 3.45 for Cs, demonstrating efficient trapping for both species. Our 3D MOT setup allows full horizontal optical access to the trapped atomic ensembles without spatial interference from the trapping or repump laser beams. Moreover, the red detuning for trapping both atomic species is smaller than in traditional configurations. This system offers a versatile platform for exploring complex phenomena in ultracold atom physics, such as Rydberg molecule formation and interspecies interactions.</description>

      <title>Grating magneto-optical trap of cesium atoms with an additional retroreflected laser beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magneto-optical trap of cesium atoms was generated by applying a circularly polarized cooling laser beam onto a reflective two-dimensional diffraction grating with an aperture and by retroreflecting the incident beam passing through the aperture while reversing the circular polarization. The cooling laser beams comprised the incident, retroreflected, and four diagonally diffracted beams at an angle of 50{\deg}. The intensity of the retroreflected beam was carefully adjusted to balance the radiation forces acting on the atoms. Despite the challenges posed by cesium atoms with high nuclear spin, a significant number of cold atoms ($7.0 {\times} 10^6$) were captured when the detuning and power of the incident beam were -10 MHz and 131 mW, respectively, with the intensity of the retroreflected beam set to 69 % of that of the incident beam. The importance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping process was highlighted when the intensity ratio was reduced to 24 %, resulting in the absence of trapped atoms. This underscores the significance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping process. Notably, the distribution of the cold atom cloud differed from other magneto-optical traps, as it was not centered in the region where the cooling beams overlapped. Instead, numerous cold atoms were observed when the cloud was positioned near the apex closer to the grating side and an edge line of the overlapping region. Therefore, trapping can be achieved with the assistance of attractive dipole forces exerted by the diffracted beams, which exhibits high intensities at these positions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian optimization in deep cooling atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling, which cools atomic and molecular gases to near absolute zero, is the crucial initial step for nearly all atomic gas experiments. However, fast achievement of numerous sub-$\mu$K cold atoms is challenging. To resolve the issue, we propose and experimentally validate an intelligent polarization gradient cooling approach enhanced by optical lattice, utilizing Maximum Hypersphere Compensation Sampling Bayesian Optimization (MHCS-BO). MHCS-BO demonstrates a twofold increase in optimization efficiency and superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional Bayesian optimization. Finally, approximate $10^8$ cold atoms at a temperature of 0.4$\pm$0.2 $\mu$K can be achieved given the optimal parameters within 15 minutes. Our work provides an intelligent protocol, which can be generalized to other high-dimension parameter optimization problems, and paves way for preparation of ultracold atom in quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing the Fifth Force on Lepton Spins through Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a fifth force mediated by a light vector boson that couples to lepton spins, characterized by axial-vector couplings to leptons and vector couplings to nucleons. This interaction generates a potential proportional to the inner product of the lepton spin vector and the nucleon-lepton relative velocity vector, a feature extensively explored with precision spin sensors. Employing weak symmetry, we show that left-handed charged lepton couplings naturally extend to left-handed neutrinos, enabling this fifth force to influence neutrino oscillations. For electron-nucleon couplings, we find that solar and reactor neutrino experiments provide comparable constraints to those from spin sensors and surpass them in the short-range fifth force region. For muon-nucleon couplings, neutrino oscillation experiments exclude the fifth force as a viable explanation for the muon $ g-2 $ anomaly in the context of a vector mediator, tightening the bounds by two orders of magnitude in coupling strength by solar and atmospheric neutrino data. Our results highlight the critical role of neutrino oscillations in probing fifth forces acting across all three generations of lepton spins.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a two-leg rectangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, we map the ground-state phase diagram of a two-leg Rydberg ladder array with lattice spacings $a_x=2a_y$. We identify various density wave phases that spontaneously break the translational symmetry or the top-bottom reflection symmetry within the ladder. By increasing the laser detuning from zero, where the system is in a disordered phase that preserves all symmetries, we observe density wave orders with spontaneous breaking of the translational $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetries at intermediate detuning values, while the reflection symmetry is preserved. These orders exhibit nonzero bond orders with positive expectation values on every $p$th rung, thus labeled as $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ phases. At larger detuning values, another spontaneous breaking of the reflection symmetry, which disrupted the bond orders on the rungs, occurs via an Ising phase transition. In these phases, either the top or the bottom site is occupied in a staggered way on every $p$th rung, breaking the translational $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ symmetry, thus labeled by $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ phases. We locate and characterize the 3-state Potts point and Ashkin-Teller point along the commensurate lines, as well as the direct chiral phase transitions between the disordered phase and the $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ ($p = 3, 4$) phases. Critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ are calculated for both conformal and chiral phase transition points. We finally identify two types of floating phases in the phase diagram: one characterized by a quasi-long-range incommensurate bond-order wave, and the other by a quasi-long-range incommensurate wave of density differences in the rungs. Our work motivates further applications of Rydberg atom arrays in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Purcell-Enhanced Generation of Photonic Bell States via the Inelastic Scattering of Single Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single atoms trapped in optical cavities exhibit immense potential as key nodes in future quantum information processing. They have already demonstrated significant advancement in various quantum technologies, particularly regarding the generation of nonclassical light. Here, we efficiently produce genuine photonic Bell states through the inelastic scattering process of single two-level intracavity atoms. An experimental violation of the Bell inequality, arising from the interference between the probability amplitudes of two photons, validates the intrinsic nature of energy-time entanglement. Coupling atoms with an optical cavity in the Purcell regime substantially enhances the two-photon scattering. This Bell state generation process does not require atomic spin control, thereby rendering it inherently immune to decoherence effects. This work advances the comprehension of resonance fluorescence and has the potential to broaden the landscape of quantum technologies and facilitate the application of photonic Bell states.</description>

      <title>Fock-space perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster calculations of electric dipole polarizability and nuclear spin-dependent parity non-conservation in Cs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement the Fock-space perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster theory to compute the electric dipole polarizability of ground and low lying excited states, and nuclear spin-dependent parity violating (NSD-PNC) transition amplitudes in Cs. Moreover, to check the accuracy of the wavefunctions used in the calculations, we compute the excitation energies, E1 transition amplitudes and magnetic dipole hyperfine constants for ground and low lying excited states. To improve the accuracy of the computed properties, we have incorporated the corrections from the relativistic and QED effects in our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations are accounted perturbatively. Our results on excitation energies, E1 transition amplitudes and hyperfine constants are in good agreement with the available experimental results. Our polarizability results using FS-PRCC theory match well with the experimental values. The values of parity-violating transition amplitudes from our calculations are, in general, on the lower side of the previous values. From the detail analysis of electron correlations, we find that the corrections from the Breit interaction and QED effects are important to get accurate results of NSD-PNC amplitudes in Cs. The largest cumulative contribution from the Breit and QED corrections is found to be $\approx$ 3.2\% of the total value. The upper bound on the theoretical uncertainty in our calculated NSD-PNC amplitudes is estimated to be about 1\%.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and electron-correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for group 11 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static dipole polarizabilities of group 11 elements (Cu, Ag, and Au) are computed using the relativistic coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. Three types of relativistic effects on dipole polarizabilities are investigated: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb contributions. The final recommended values, including uncertainties, are $46.91 \pm 1.31$ a.u. for Cu, $50.97 \pm 1.93$ a.u. for Ag, and $36.68 \pm 0.78$ a.u. for Au. Our results show close agreement with the values recommended in the 2018 Table of static dipole polarizabilities for neutral elements [\textit{Mol. Phys.} \textbf{2019}, \textit{117}, 1200], with reduced uncertainties for Ag and Au. The analysis indicates that scalar-relativistic effects are the dominant relativistic contribution for these elements, while SOC effects are negligible. The influence of electron correlation across all relativistic regimes is also evaluated, demonstrating its significant role in the accurate calculation of dipole polarizabilities.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and electron-correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for group 12 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we report a comprehensive calculation of static dipole polarizabilities for group 12 elements using the finite-field approach in conjunction with the relativistic coupled-cluster method, including single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. Relativistic effects are systematically explored, encompassing scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and full Dirac-Coulomb contributions. The recommended polarizability values, with uncertainties, are $37.95 \pm 0.77$ a.u. for Zn, $45.68 \pm 1.21$ a.u. for Cd, $34.04 \pm 0.68$ a.u. for Hg, and $27.92 \pm 0.28$ a.u. for Cn. These results are in excellent agreement with the 2018 compilation of static dipole polarizabilities [Mol. Phys. \textbf{117}, 1200 (2019)] and reduce uncertainties for Cd and Cn. Our analysis demonstrates that scalar-relativistic effects dominate the relativistic corrections, with SOC contributions found to be negligible. The role of electron correlation is examined across all relativistic regimes, highlighting its critical importance in achieving accurate polarizability predictions.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Optical Ramsey-Doppler Spectroscopy of Positronium and Muonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positronium and muonium, as purely leptonic atoms without internal structure, provide ideal systems for high-precision tests of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and measurements of fundamental constants. However, the high velocities of these lightweight atoms complicate precision spectroscopy, particularly in the 1S-2S transition, due to transit time broadening and second-order Doppler shifts. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method combining two-photon Ramsey spectroscopy with a technique to correct the second-order Doppler shifts on an atom-by-atom basis. Additionally, this approach suppresses systematic effects of the AC Stark shift to a negligible level compared to the target precision. Simulations predict that for both positronium and muonium, this method could improve the measurement precision of the 1S-2S transition by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art. This approach opens up new avenues for rigorous bound-state QED tests and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Atomic fluorescence collection into planar photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize two diffractive collection elements operating at $\lambda=397$ nm; a forward emitting design is predicted to offer 0.25% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode, while a more efficient reverse-emitting design offers $1.14\%$ collection efficiency, albeit with more demanding fabrication requirements. Close agreement between simulated and measured emission for both designs indicates practicality of these collection efficiencies, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>
