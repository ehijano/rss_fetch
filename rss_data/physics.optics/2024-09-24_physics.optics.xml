      <title>Efficient excitation transfer in an LH2-inspired nanoscale stacked ring geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength ring-shaped structures of quantum emitters exhibit outstanding radiation properties and are useful for antennas, excitation transport, and storage. Taking inspiration from the oligomeric geometry of biological light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes, we study here generic examples and predict highly efficient excitation transfer in a three-dimensional (3D) subwavelength concentric stacked ring structure with a diameter of 400 \textit{nm}, formed by two-level atoms. Utilizing the quantum optical open system master equation approach for the collective dipole dynamics, we demonstrate that, depending on the system parameters, our bio-mimicked 3D ring enables efficient excitation transfer between two ring layers. Our findings open prospects for engineering other biomimetic light-matter platforms and emitter arrays to achieve efficient energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Metal Oxide Nanocrystals as Building Blocks for Infrared Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on experimental and simulation methods we helped develop, we are advancing mechanistic understanding of how self-assembled NC metamaterials can produce distinctive near- and far-field optical properties not readily achievable in lithographically patterned structures. First, the impacts of the inevitable defects and disorder associated with self-assembly can be rationalized and, in some cases, recognized as advantageous. Second, self-assembly enables intimate nanoscale intermixing of different NC and molecular components. By incorporating probe molecules within the gaps between NCs where the electric field enhancement is strongest, we show enhanced detection of molecular vibrations that can be optimized by tuning the size and resonance frequency of the NCs. We show how metasurfaces incorporating mixtures of NCs with different doping concentrations can achieve epsilon-near-zero dielectric response over a broad frequency range. Finally, considering the NC metasurface itself as a building block, we show how photonic structures incorporating these assemblies can harness and amplify their distinctive properties. Through modeling the NC monolayer as a slab with an effective permittivity response, we designed a frequency-tunable IR perfect absorber by layering the NCs on a simple open cavity structure. Since the perfect absorption architecture further enhances the IR electric field localization strength, we expect that this integration strategy can enhance molecular vibration coupling or non-linear optical response. The versatility of the NC assembly and integration approach suggests opportunities for various metal oxide NC superstructures, including mixing and stacking of NCs beyond a single monolayer, representing a vast parameter space for design of linear and nonlinear IR optical components.</description>

      <title>Revealing the propagation dynamic of Laguerre-Gaussian beam with two Bohm-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing x-Bohm theory and p-Bohm theory, we construct the position and momentum trajectories of single-mode and superposed-mode Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams. The dependence of divergence velocity and rotation velocity on the initial position and propagation distance is quantified, indicating that LG beams exhibit subluminal effects, even in free space. Additionally, we clarify the formation of the petal-shaped intensity distribution of the superposed-mode LG beam in terms of motion trajectory, where the particle-like trajectory and wave-like interference are ``simultaneously" observed. Our work provides an intuitive way to visualize the propagation characteristics of LG beams and deepen the comprehension of Bohm-like theory.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity near-diffraction-limited projection through scattering with reference-less transmission matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image projection through scattering media has applications ranging from light delivery through multimode fiber to near-eye displays. Conventional methods utilize the transmission matrix (TM) measured by interfering with a reference beam. However, it is noise-sensitive, often resulting in artifacts that degrade the projection quality. Here we propose to characterize the scattering by computationally retrieving TM from intensity-only measurements and solve the projection problem formulated with the retrieved TM by optimization. We experimentally validate the proposed method by projecting through a multimode fiber. Compared to the conventional methods, it projects improved-quality images with resolution near to the diffraction limit, and simplifies the experimental setup by eliminating the reference. It paves the way for applications of high-quality near-diffraction-limited projection through scattering.</description>

      <title>Rapid 3D imaging at cellular resolution for digital cytopathology with a multi-camera array scanner (MCAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical microscopy has long been the standard method for diagnosis in cytopathology. Whole slide scanners can image and digitize large sample areas automatically, but are slow, expensive and therefore not widely available. Clinical diagnosis of cytology specimens is especially challenging since these samples are both spread over large areas and thick, which requires 3D capture. Here, we introduce a new parallelized microscope for scanning thick specimens across extremely wide fields-of-view (54x72 mm^2) at 1.2 and 0.6 {\mu}m resolutions, accompanied by machine learning software to rapidly assess these 16 gigapixel scans. This Multi-Camera Array Scanner (MCAS) comprises 48 micro-cameras closely arranged to simultaneously image different areas. By capturing 624 megapixels per snapshot, the MCAS is significantly faster than most conventional whole slide scanners. We used this system to digitize entire cytology samples (scanning three entire slides in 3D in just several minutes) and demonstrate two machine learning techniques to assist pathologists: first, an adenocarcinoma detection model in lung specimens (0.73 recall); second, a slide-level classification model of lung smears (0.969 AUC).</description>

      <title>Microwave photonic frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis: Unlocking bandwidths over hundreds of GHz with a 10-nanosecond temporal resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and broadband spectrum sensing is an essential component in cognitive radio systems, intelligent transportation systems, electronic warfare systems, etc. However, traditional electronic-based solutions have a trade-off among the analysis bandwidth, temporal resolution, and real-time performance. In comparison, microwave photonic solutions can overcome the trade-off at the cost of frequency accuracy and resolution. Nevertheless, the reported microwave photonic solutions suffer from a very poor frequency resolution and impose extremely high requirements on hardware when the analysis bandwidth is close to or greater than 100 GHz. Here, we show a microwave photonic frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis method, which is implemented by dispersion-based frequency-to-time mapping and assisted by a specially designed V-shape linearly frequency-modulated signal and a duty-cycle-enabling technique. Compared with the reported microwave photonic solutions, the hardware requirements are greatly reduced when achieving similar performance conditions. Using a total dispersion of -6817 ps/nm and a V-shape linearly frequency-modulated signal with a bandwidth of 31.6 GHz and a duty cycle of 1/4, we achieve an ambiguity-free analysis bandwidth of 252.8 GHz, a corresponding temporal resolution of 13.75 ns and a frequency resolution of 1.1 GHz. The temporal resolution can be improved to 6.875 ns when the duty cycle is changed to 1/2, while the analysis bandwidth in this case is 126.4 GHz.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Multimode Fiber Imaging and Characterization Under Thermal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF) imaging aided by machine learning holds promise for numerous applications, including medical endoscopy. A key challenge for this technology is the sensitivity of modal transmission characteristics to environmental perturbations. Here, we show experimentally that an MMF imaging scheme based on a neural network (NN) can achieve results that are significantly robust to thermal perturbations. For example, natural images are successfully reconstructed as the MMF's temperature is varied by up to 50$^{\circ}$C relative to the training scenario, despite substantial variations in the speckle patterns caused by thermal changes. A dense NN with a single hidden layer is found to outperform a convolutional NN suitable for standard computer vision tasks. In addition, we demonstrate that NN parameters can be used to understand the MMF properties by reconstructing the approximate transmission matrices, and we show that the image reconstruction accuracy is directly related to the temperature dependence of the MMF's transmission characteristics.</description>

      <title>Single-mode Dispersion-engineered Nonlinear Integrated Waveguides for Ultra-broadband Optical Amplification and Wavelength Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-wave mixing has extensively been investigated for various applications such as communications, spectroscopy, metrology, quantum computing and bio-imaging. However, there is a clear desire to implement these functionalities in a small footprint nonlinear platform, being capable of efficient operation across a large optical bandwidth. Many such integrated platforms have been explored, but suffer from intrinsic significant performance degradation, because conventional approaches of nonlinear photonic waveguide geometry construction for dispersion engineering focus on waveguide cross section and result in always being multimode as a byproduct. Here we propose and demonstrate a methodology that utilizes not only the impact of the waveguide cross section on the modal and dispersion behavior of the waveguide but also includes the impact of the waveguide bend for cutting off high-order modes. This approach results in simultaneous single-mode operation and dispersion engineering for very broadband operation of four-wave mixing. While we implemented this in silicon nitride waveguides, which has emerged as a promising platform capable of continuous-wave optical parametric amplification, the design approach can be universally used with other platforms as well. By also considering both second- and fourth-order dispersion we achieve unprecedented amplification bandwidths of approximately 300 nm in super-low-loss silicon nitride nonlinear waveguides. In addition, penalty-free all-optical wavelength conversion of 100 Gbit/s data in a single optical carrier over 200 nm is realized, for the first time, without optical amplification of signal or idler waves. These single-mode hyper-dispersion-engineered nonlinear integrated waveguides can become practical building blocks in versatile nonlinear photonic devices and optical networks.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond all-optically reconfigurable photonics in optical fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel all-optical platform in multimode and multicore fibres. By using a low-power probe beam and a high-power counter-propagating control beam, we achieve advanced and dynamic control over light propagation within the fibres. This setup enables all-optical reconfiguration of the probe, which is achieved by solely tuning the control beam power. Key operations such as fully tuneable power splitting and mode conversion, core-to-core switching and combination, along with remote probe characterization, are demonstrated at the sub-nanosecond time scale. Our experimental results are supported by a theoretical model that extends to fibres with an arbitrary number of modes and cores. The implementation of these operations in a single platform underlines its versatility, a critical feature of next-generation photonic systems. These results represent a significant shift from existing methods that rely on electro-optical or thermo-optical modulation for tunability. They pave the way towards a fast and energy-efficient alternative through all-optical modulation, a keystone for the advancement of future reconfigurable optical networks and optical computing. Scaling these techniques to highly nonlinear materials could underpin ultrafast all-optically programmable integrated photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of wireless telegraphy, wireless communication via electromagnetic (EM) signals has become a standard solution to meet the growing demand for information transfer in modern society. To prevent counterfeiting and manipulation by unauthorized individuals and agencies, it is crucial to innovate and enhance security through information encryption. In this paper, we introduce a metasurface that controls amplitude modulation at two different frequencies. Here, focusing on amplitude-frequency modulation for both x- and y- polarizations, we present an encrypted wireless communication protocol that using the chaos algorithm to secure the target data and prevent eavesdroppers from accessing it. The encrypted data is transmitted through the varying amplitudes at two different frequencies for both linear polarizations, achieved using two distinct graphene layers individually controlled by external biasing conditions. The extensive freedom enabled by simultaneous modulation of amplitude, frequency, and polarization allows information to be transmitted across diverse channels, thereby enhancing the security of encrypted information. The simulations demonstrate that encoding data, such as images, and transmitting it through amplitude-frequency modulation for both horizontal and vertical polarizations offer promising opportunities for various applications, including THz communications, anti-counterfeiting, THz data storage, and THz data transmission.</description>

      <title>Modeling luminescent coupling in multi-junction solar cells: Perovskite Silicon tandem case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminescent coupling is a characteristic of multi-junction solar cells which has often been neglected in models of their performance. The effect describes the absorption of light emitted from a higher band gap semiconductor by a lower band gap semiconductor. In this way, light which might have been lost can be utilized for current generation. We present a framework for modeling this effect in both planar layer stacks and devices with periodic nanostructuring. As a case study, we evaluate how luminescent coupling is affected by the inclusion of nanostructuring in a perovskite silicon tandem solar cell. We find that nanostructuring, while reducing the reflection loss for tandem solar cells also reduces the luminescent coupling, allowing more light to be emitted to the surroundings, when compared to planar devices. This highlights the need to include modeling of this effect into optimization schemes in order to find the trade-off between these two effects.

      <title>Stochastically Structured Illumination Microscopy scan less super resolution imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Super-resolution, a varying-illumination image stack is required. This enriched the dataset typically necessitates precise mechanical control and micron scale optical alignment and repeatability. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for super-resolution microscopy called Stochastically Structured Illumination Microscopy (S2IM), which bypasses the need for illumination control instead exploiting the random, uncontrolled movement of the target object. We tested our methodology within the clinically relevant ophthalmoscopic setting, harnessing the inherent saccadic motion of the eye to induce stochastic displacement of the illumination pattern on the retina. We opted to avoid human subjects by utilizing a phantom eye model, featuring a retina composed of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) retinal neurons, and replicating the ocular saccadic movements by custom actuators. Our findings demonstrate that S$^2$IM unlocks scan-less super-resolution with a resolution enhancement of 1.91, with promising prospects also beyond ophthalmoscopy applications such as active matter or atmospheric/astronomical observation.</description>

      <title>On demand single photon generation and coherent control of excitons from resonantly driven nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control of single photon sources is a key requirement for the advancement of photonic quantum technologies. Among them, nanowire-based quantum dot sources are popular due to their potential for on-chip hybrid integration. Here we demonstrate on-demand single-photon generation ($g^{(2)}(0)(X^{*}) =0.078$ and $g^{(2)}(0)(X)= 0.03$) from resonantly excited InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dots and observe Rabi oscillations in the dot emission, indicating successful coherent manipulation of the excitonic states in the nanowire. We also measure a low emission time jitter for resonant excitation as compared to above-band excitation. This work addresses the long-standing challenge of resonantly exciting nanowire-quantum dots. It paves the way for hybrid quantum photonic integration, enabling spin-photon entanglement and matter memories on-chip.</description>

      <title>About the role of short and long trajectories on the quantum optical state after high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) involves the up-conversion of a high-intensity driving field into its harmonic orders. This process is intrinsically non-classical, requiring from quantum mechanics for a complete explanation as, under suitable conditions, involves phenomena such as particle tunneling through a potential barrier. When exposed to a high-intensity, low-frequency laser field, bound electrons ionize via tunneling, accelerate under the driving field, and recombine with the parent ion, emitting high-harmonic radiation. However, electrons can follow two distinct pathways -- short and long trajectories -- during these steps. In this work, we evaluate the signatures left by these trajectories on the quantum optical state after HHG, and observe that they lead to entanglement between the driving field and the generated harmonics. By leveraging these correlations, we use harmonic generation to herald the creation of optical Schr\"odinger cat-like states in the driving field. Additionally, using an ab-initio approach, we examine how propagation effects, which spatially separate the harmonic contributions from short and long trajectories, influence the non-classical characteristics of the emitted light.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning real-time phase retrieval of imperfect diffraction patterns from X-ray free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is attracting surging interest across nearly all scientific areas by enabling the analysis of large datasets and the extraction of scientific information from incomplete data. Data-driven science is rapidly growing, especially in X-ray methodologies, where advanced light sources and detection technologies accumulate vast amounts of data that exceed meticulous human inspection capabilities. Despite the increasing demands, the full application of machine learning has been hindered by the need for data-specific optimizations. In this study, we introduce a new deep-learning-based phase retrieval method for imperfect diffraction data. This method provides robust phase retrieval for simulated data and performs well on weak-signal single-pulse diffraction data from X-ray free-electron lasers. Moreover, the method significantly reduces data processing time, facilitating real-time image reconstructions that are crucial for high-repetition-rate data acquisition. Thus, this approach offers a reliable solution to the phase problem and is expected to be widely adopted across various research areas.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously enhancing brightness and purity of WSe$_2$ single photon emitter using high-aspect-ratio nanopillar array on metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer semiconductor transferred on nanopillar arrays provides site-controlled, on-chip single photon emission, which is a scalable light source platform for quantum technologies. However, the brightness of these emitters reported to date often falls short of the perceived requirement for such applications. Also, the single photon purity usually degrades as the brightness increases. Hence, there is a need for a design methodology to achieve enhanced emission rate while maintaining high single photon purity. Using WSe$_2$ on high-aspect-ratio ($\sim 3$ - at least two-fold higher than previous reports) nanopillar arrays, here we demonstrate $&gt;10$ MHz single photon emission rate in the 770-800 nm band that is compatible with quantum memory and repeater networks (Rb-87-D1/D2 lines), and satellite quantum communication. The emitters exhibit excellent purity (even at high emission rates) and improved out-coupling due to the use of a gold back reflector that quenches the emission away from the nanopillar.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary behavior of the upconversion processes of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$ ions pair doping the $Y_2O_3$ ceramic illuminated with 976 nm laser light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The studies of the upconversion response of RE ions in various hosts usually depict a static picture, whereas, at constant illumination, the upconverted emission is also constant. We discovered here that, at least in the case of $Y_2O_3$ doped with $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$, this is not the case. At constant illuminated power, the upconversion emission is not only fluctuating, but it varies in a manner which seems to be a superposition of intensity waves with different frequencies. We present here the results of the measurements we've performed on $Y_2O_3$ with $1\%Er^{3+}-2\%Yb^{3+}$. The origin of this effect remain to be established but it shows that the energy transfers during the upconversion are an interplay of absorption-saturation-emission-relaxation processes.</description>

      <title>Simple, highly-stable transfer cavity for laser stabilization based on a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the design and operation of a high-stability Fabry-Perot cavity, for laser stabilization in cavity quantum-electrodynamics experiments. Our design is based on an inexpensive and readily available uniaxial carbon-fiber reinforced polymer tube spacer, featuring an ultra-low thermal expansion coefficient. As a result, our $136\mathrm{mm}$-long cavity, which has a finesse of ${5160}$, shows a coefficient of thermal expansion of $1.6 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Enclosing it in a hermetic chamber at room-pressure and using a simple temperature stabilization, we observe absolute frequency excursions over a full day below $50~\mathrm{MHz}$ for a laser operating at $446.785\mathrm{THz}$. The frequency stability is limited by the imperfect thermal isolation from the environment and can be corrected using a built-in piezo-electric actuator. In addition, we discuss a different variant of this design and identify future improvements. Our system provides a cost-effective and robust solution for transferring laser stability over different wavelengths, as well as for linewidth reduction or spectral filtering of CW laser sources for applications in quantum science.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of strongly interacting solitons in optical fiber experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model underlying physics of guiding light in single-mode fibers -- the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE), reveals a remarkable balance of the fiber dispersion and nonlinearity, leading to the existence of optical solitons. With the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method and its perturbation theory extension one can go beyond single-soliton physics and investigate nonlinear dynamics of complex optical pulses driven by soliton interactions. Here, advancing the IST perturbation theory approach, we introduce the eigenvalue response functions, which provide an intuitively clear way to manipulate individual characteristics of solitons even in the case of their entire overlapping, i.e. very strong interactions. The response functions reveal the spatial sensitivity of the multi-soliton pulse concerning its instantaneous perturbations, allowing one to manipulate the velocities and amplitudes of each soliton. Our experimental setup, based on a recirculating optical fiber loop system and homodyne measurement, enables observation of long-distance NLSE dynamics and complete characterization of optical pulses containing several solitons. Adding a localized phase perturbation on a box-shaped wavefield, we change individual soliton characteristics and can detach solitons selectively from the whole pulse. The detached solitons exhibit velocities very close to the theoretical predictions, thereby demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the response functions approach.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Photogalvanic Effects in Two-Dimensional Multiferroic Breathing Kagome Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, known for their multiple tunable orders, present an exceptional opportunity to manipulate nonlinear optical responses, which are sensitive to symmetry. In this study, we propose leveraging electric and magnetic fields to selectively control and switch specific types of photogalvanic effects in two-dimensional multiferroic breathing kagome materials. Taking monolayer Nb3I8 as an example, we demonstrate that the shift current, characterized by the real-space shift of electrons and holes, is predominantly unaffected by magnetic order. In contrast, injection current, featured by quantum metric dipole in momentum space, is closely related to valley polarization which can be controlled by magnetic field. Furthermore, both photocurrents can be reversed by out-of-plane electric field via the lattice breathing. Our findings reveal the potential of multiferroic beathing kagome structures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications and sensors.</description>

Abstract: We report on the first deployment of a ytterbium (Yb) transportable optical lattice clock (TOLC), commercially shipping the clock 3,000 km from Boulder, Colorado to Washington DC. The system, composed of a rigidly mounted optical reference cavity, atomic physics package, and an optical frequency comb, fully realizes an independent frequency standard for comparisons in the optical and microwave domains. The shipped Yb TOLC was fully operational within 2 days of arrival, enabling frequency comparisons with rubidium (Rb) fountains at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first deployment of a fully independent TOLC, including the frequency comb, coherently uniting the optical stability of the Yb TOLC to the microwave output of the Rb fountain.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of a mirror-symmetry plane in multiple-scattering media under plane-wave illumination along the symmetry plane. Designed and fabricated samples' optical transport properties are compared quantitatively with three-dimensional modeling. Strong polarization-dependent deviations of the bulk speckle-averaged intensity distribution at the symmetry plane are observed, showing either up to a factor two enhancement or complete suppression of the ensemble-averaged intensities. We derive analytical expressions for the ensemble-averaged intensity profiles near the symmetry plane. Apart from their interest in fundamental light propagation studies, applications of mirror-symmetric scattering media are envisioned in anti-counterfeiting.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Symmetry Breaking in Coupled Cavity Photonic Crystal Waveguide on Dispersion Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the effect of integrated auxiliary rods at varying angles to the primary cavity rod on the dispersion characteristics of the photonic crystal coupled cavity waveguide (PC CCW). Here, it is intended to break the symmetry of the cavity region by introducing auxiliary rods which gives the degree of freedom for tuning effective index of the PC waveguide. Furthermore, rotational angle variations of auxiliary rods reveal slow light operation of the PC CCW where the group index is maximized and group velocity dispersion, as well as the third-order dispersion, are minimized. In addition, auxiliary rods with a broken symmetry increase not only group index but also operating bandwidth and accordingly increase group bandwidth product by 675\%. Leveraging these results, we demonstrate effective rainbow trapping by manipulating the auxiliary rod angles in photonic crystal coupled cavity waveguides. Our results have encouraging implications for optical buffering, multiplexing, demultiplexing, advanced time-domain and spatial signal processing.</description>

      <title>Breaking Abbe's diffraction limit with harmonic deactivation microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical microscopy provides elegant means for label-free imaging of biological samples and condensed matter systems. The widespread areas of application could even be increased if resolution was improved, which is currently limited by the famous Abbe diffraction limit. Super-resolution techniques can break the diffraction limit but rely on fluorescent labeling. This makes them incompatible with (sub-)femtosecond temporal resolution and applications that demand the absence of labeling. Here, we introduce harmonic deactivation microscopy (HADES) for breaking the diffraction limit in non-fluorescent samples. By controlling the harmonic generation process on the quantum level with a second donut-shaped pulse, we confine the third harmonic generation to three times below the original focus size and use this pulse for scanning microscopy. We demonstrate that resolution improvement by deactivation is more efficient for higher harmonic orders, and only limited by the maximum applicable deactivation-pulse fluence. This provides a route towards sub-100~nm resolution in a regular nonlinear microscope. The new capability of label-free super-resolution can find immediate applications in condensed matter physics, semiconductor metrology, and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>A fixed phase tunable directional coupler based on coupling tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of photonic integrated circuits has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a growing demand for devices that offer high-performance reconfigurability. Due to the inability of conventional tunable directional couplers (TDCs) to maintain a fixed phase while tuning the reflectivity, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are employed as the primary building blocks for reflectivity tuning in constructing large-scale circuits. However, MZIs are prone to fabrication errors due to the need for perfect balanced directional couplers to achieve 0-1 reflectivity, which hinders their scalability. In this study, we introduce a design of a TDC based on coupling constant tuning in the thin film Lithium Niobate platform and present an optimized design. Our optimized TDC design enables arbitrary reflectivity tuning while ensuring a consistent phase across a wide range of operating wavelengths. Furthermore, it exhibits fewer bending sections than MZIs and is inherently resilient to fabrication errors in waveguide geometry and coupling length compared to both MZIs and conventional TDCs. Our work contributes to developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits with implications for various fields, including optical communication systems and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Cooperative atomic emission from a line of atoms interacting with a resonant plane surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super- and subradiance can be observed in the fluorescence emitted by a system of N atoms in vacuum, after interaction with a laser beam. In the vicinity of a dielectric or metallic surface, Casimir-Polder effects can modify collective atomic frequency shifts and decay rates. In this work, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using the coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free space, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton resonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case, cooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic fluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by considering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface. Finally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant metasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the results of our study.</description>
