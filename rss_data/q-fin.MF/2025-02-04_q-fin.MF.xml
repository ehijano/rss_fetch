      <title>Trade Dynamics of the Global Dry Bulk Shipping Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the inherently random structures of dry bulk shipping networks, often likened to a taxi service, and identifies the underlying trade dynamics that contribute to this randomness within individual cargo sub-networks. By analysing micro-level trade flow data from 2015 to 2023, we explore the evolution of dry commodity networks, including grain, coal, and iron ore, and suggest that the Giant Strongly Connected Components exhibit small-world phenomena, indicative of efficient bilateral trade. The significant heterogeneity of in-degree and out-degree within these sub-networks, primarily driven by importing ports, underscores the complexity of their dynamics. Our temporal analysis shows that while the Covid-19 pandemic profoundly impacted the coal network, the Ukraine conflict significantly altered the grain network, resulting in changes in community structures. Notably, grain sub-networks display periodic changes, suggesting distinct life cycles absent in coal and iron ore networks. These findings illustrate that the randomness in dry bulk shipping networks is a reflection of real-world trade dynamics, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in navigating and predicting network behaviours.</description>

      <title>On Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and the Black-Scholes Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two novel and direct quantum mechanical representations of the Black-Scholes model are constructed based on the (Wick-rotated) quantization of two specific mechanical systems. The quantum setup is achieved by means of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operator (one for each model), and not by merely applying the usual naive rule. Additionally, the clear identification of the geometric content of the underlying classical framework is exploited in order to arrive at a noncommutative quantum mechanics generalization of the Black-Scholes model. We also consider a system consisting of two degrees of freedom whose (Wick-rotated) quantization leads to a model which can be seen as related to the Merton-Garman family. This model is also generalized via noncommutative quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity, FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities, cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Utility Maximization Problem with Tsallis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study expected utility maximization problem with constant relative risk aversion utility function in a complete market under the reinforcement learning framework. To induce exploration, we introduce the Tsallis entropy regularizer, which generalizes the commonly used Shannon entropy. Unlike the classical Merton's problem, which is always well-posed and admits closed-form solutions, we find that the utility maximization exploratory problem is ill-posed in certain cases, due to over-exploration. With a carefully selected primary temperature function, we investigate two specific examples, for which we fully characterize their well-posedness and provide semi-closed-form solutions. It is interesting to find that one example has the well-known Gaussian distribution as the optimal strategy, while the other features the rare Wigner semicircle distribution, which is equivalent to a scaled Beta distribution. The means of the two optimal exploratory policies coincide with that of the classical counterpart. In addition, we examine the convergence of the value function and optimal exploratory strategy as the exploration vanishes. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm and conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Axioms for Automated Market Makers: A Mathematical Framework in FinTech and Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within this work we consider an axiomatic framework for Automated Market Makers (AMMs). AMMs are smart contracts that set prices for swaps on a pool of assets. By imposing reasonable axioms on the underlying utility function, we are able to characterize the properties of the swap size of the assets and of the resulting pricing oracle. In providing these general axioms, we define a novel measure of price impacts that can be used to quantify those costs between different AMM constructions. We have analyzed many existing AMMs and shown that the vast majority of them satisfy our axioms. We have also considered the question of fees and divergence loss. In doing so, we have proposed a new fee structure so as to make the AMM indifferent to transaction splitting. Finally, we have proposed a novel AMM that has nice analytical properties and provides a large range over which there is no divergence loss.</description>

      <title>Signature SDEs from an affine and polynomial perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signature stochastic differential equations (SDEs) constitute a large class of stochastic processes, here driven by Brownian motions, whose characteristics are linear maps of their own signature, i.e. of iterated integrals of the process with itself, and allow therefore for a generic path dependence. We show that their prolongation with the corresponding signature is an affine and polynomial process taking values in the set of group-like elements of the extended tensor algebra. By relying on the duality theory for affine or polynomial processes, we obtain explicit formulas in terms of converging power series for the Fourier-Laplace transform and the expected value of entire functions of the signature process' marginals. The coefficients of these power series are solutions of extended tensor algebra valued Riccati and linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), respectively, whose vector fields can be expressed in terms of the characteristics of the corresponding SDEs. We thus construct a class of stochastic processes which is universal (in a sense specified in the introduction) within Ito-diffusions with path-dependent characteristics and allows for an explicit characterization of the Fourier-Laplace transform and hence the full law on path space. The practical applicability of this affine and polynomial approach is illustrated by several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation of functional input maps on weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>
