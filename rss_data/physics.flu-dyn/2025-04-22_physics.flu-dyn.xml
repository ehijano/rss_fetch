      <title>A thermodynamically consistent and robust four-equation model for multi-phase multi-component compressible flows using ENO-type schemes including interface regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a concise and robust computational framework is proposed to simulate compressible multi-phase multi-component flows. To handle both shocks and material interfaces, a positivity-preserving ENO-type scheme is coupled with multi-phase interface regularization terms. The positivity-preserving limiter is conservative and is applied locally for minimal degradation of the baseline ENO-type scheme. The interface regularization terms are extended from the conservative diffuse interface (CDI) model to accommodate multi-phase, multi-component flows. The ENO-type scheme is designed to be consistent with the thermodynamic equilibrium assumptions of the four-equation multi-phase model, naturally enforcing the interface equilibrium condition - preventing oscillations in pressure, velocity, and temperature around isothermal material interfaces - without requiring additional equations for volume fraction or mixture equation of state parameters, as is commonly done for the five-equation model. Additionally, non-dilute species diffusion models are extended to the multi-phase, multi-component setting. We show that this consistent framework is equally applicable for regimes ranging from single-phase to multi-phase multi-component flows. The proposed models and numerical schemes are implemented in the highly parallel Hypersonic Task based Research (HTR) Solver, and high-resolution simulations are performed using both CPUs and GPUs.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the rotational viscosity transfer across scales in Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical effects that span multiple physical scales -- such as the influence of vanishing molecular viscosity on large-scale flow structures under specific conditions -- play a critical role in real fluid systems. The spin angular momentum-conserving Navier--Stokes equations offer a theoretical framework for describing such multiscale fluid dynamics by decomposing total angular momentum into bulk and intrinsic spin components. However, this framework still assumes locally non-solid rotational flows, a condition that remains empirically unverified. This study addresses such unvalidated assumptions intrinsic to the model and extends it within the framework of turbulence hierarchy theory. The theory suggests that under certain conditions, small-scale structures may transfer to larger scales through the rotational viscosity. To verify this, we conducted spectral analyses of freely decaying two-dimensional turbulence initialized with a vortex-concentrated distribution. The results indicate that rotational viscosity exhibits interscale transfer behavior, revealing a new mechanism by which order can propagate from small to large scales in Navier--Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Growth of Elongated Vapor Bubbles During Flow Boiling Heat Transfer in Wavy Microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow boiling within microchannels is an efficient heat removal mechanism by utilizing the latent heat of the fluid. Numerical simulations can resolve the small temporal and spatial scales of the vapor bubbles in the flow boiling process, thus accessing many details of the flow which is unattainable experimentally. Most of the previous studies of flow boiling heat transfer used straight microchannels, even though curved microchannels have potential to further enhance the heat transfer performance. In this study, the flow boiling heat transfer in wavy microchannels is studied via numerical simulation by focusing on the growth of the vapor bubbles. Straight and wavy microchannels are considered for comparison and analysis. The numerical simulations are conducted using the finite volume method to solve the flow and the heat transfer, and the volume of fluid (VOF) method to capture the interface dynamics. The effects of key dimensionless numbers on bubble growth rate and wall heat transfer are quantified, including the Weber number, the Capillary number, and the Jakob number. The results indicate that the wavy structure of the microchannel has a strong effect on the bubble growth and the wall heat transfer in microchannels. As the waviness of the microchannel increases, the bubble grows faster because of the bubble deformation by the wavy channel, the bubble moves faster due to the bubble expansion, and the heat transfer is enhanced by the perturbation of the bubble to the flow. With the large velocity perpendicular to the channel flow direction induced by the waviness, the local Nusselt number of the wavy channel could be high up to 2.6 times higher than the straight channel.</description>

      <title>Mist formation during micro-explosion of emulsion droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The micro-explosion of emulsion droplets plays an important role in promoting atomization, improving combustion efficiency, and reducing pollutant emissions. In this experimental study of the micro-explosion of emulsion droplets, we find that mist can be generated during the heating of emulsion droplets, and the mist generation is closely related to the micro-explosion process. Combined analysis from high-speed images, gas chromatography, and droplet temperature variation shows that the mist generation is due to the condensation of vapor into small droplets as the temperature decreases. Two micro-explosion modes are observed, intense micro-explosion with a large amount of mist and weak micro-explosion with a small amount of mist. Different emulsified fuels are tested, and mist can be produced for all the emulsified fuels. The mist is quantitatively analyzed via digital image processing. According to the mist concentration curve in the micro-explosion process, the micro-explosion mode can be distinguished. The effects of the water and surfactant contents in the emulsion droplets are studied, and the mists are used to characterize the micro-explosion. Increasing the water content can promote the vaporization of the water phase, increase the strength of micro-explosion, and result in a large amount of mist. Increasing the surfactant content can improve the stability of the emulsion droplet, reduce the probability of intense micro-explosion, and hence reduce the mist concentration.</description>

      <title>Transitions of breakup regimes for viscous droplets in airflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet breakup is important in many natural and industrial processes, but the current classification of breakup regimes, especially the intermediate breakup regime, is ambiguous. In this study, the transitions of breakup regimes for viscous droplets are investigated experimentally using high-speed imaging taken from a side view and a 45$^{\circ}$ view. Based on the morphology change in the middle of the droplet, the breakup regimes are classified into no-breakup, bag breakup, bag-stamen, low-order multimode, high-order multimode, and shear-stripping breakup. The droplet morphologies in different regimes and the corresponding transitions are discussed in detail. The droplet viscosity dissipates the kinetic energy transferred by the airflow during the initial droplet flattening, and affects the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability wave after the flattening. Through the analysis of the droplet deformation and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability with the droplet viscosity taken into account, the transition conditions of different regimes are obtained in a regime map. By further considering the relative velocity loss between the droplet and the airflow, the ranges of the dual-bag breakup in the low-order multimode regime and the droplet retraction in the bag-stamen regime are determined.</description>

      <title>Optimal Lattice Boltzmann Closures through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) offers a powerful and versatile approach to simulating diverse hydrodynamic phenomena, spanning microfluidics to aerodynamics. The vast range of spatiotemporal scales inherent in these systems currently renders full resolution impractical, necessitating the development of effective closure models for under-resolved simulations. Under-resolved LBMs are unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Metastable Turbulence in Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The onset of turbulence in pipe flow has been a fundamental challenge in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering for over 140 years. To date, the precursor of this laminar-turbulent transition is recognized as transient turbulent spots or puffs, but their defining characteristics - longevity, abrupt relaminarization, and super-exponential lifetime scaling - have been lack of first-principles explanations. By combining extensive computer simulations, theory, and verifications with experimental data, we identify distinct puff relaminarizations separated by a critical Reynolds number, which are defined by a noisy saddle-node bifurcation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Below the critical number, the mean lifetime of puff follows a square-root scaling law, representing an intrinsically deterministic decay dominated by the critical slowing down. Above the critical value, the bifurcation's node branch creates a potential well stabilizing the turbulence, while the saddle branch mediates stochastic barrier-crossing events that drive memoryless decay - a hallmark of metastable states. Accordingly, the mean lifetimes are solved theoretically and can be fitted super-exponentially. By quantifying the deterministic and stochastic components in the kinetic energy equation, the lifetime statistics of puff are analyzed in a unified framework across low-to-moderate Reynolds number regimes, uncovering the mechanisms governing the transition to metastable turbulence in pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Invariance-embedded Machine Learning Sub-grid-scale Stress Models for Meso-scale Hurricane Boundary Layer Flow Simulation I: Model Development and $\textit{a priori}$ Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops invariance-embedded machine learning sub-grid-scale (SGS) stress models admitting turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) backscatter towards more accurate large eddy simulation (LES) of meso-scale turbulent hurricane boundary layer flows. The new machine learning SGS model consists of two parts: a classification model used to distinguish regions with either strong energy cascade or energy backscatter from those with mild TKE transfer and a regression model used to calculate SGS stresses in regions with strong TKE transfer. To ease model implementation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, the Smagorinsky model with a signed coefficient $C_s$, where a positive value indicates energy cascade while a negative one indicates energy backscatter, is employed as the carrier of the machine learning model. To improve its robustness and generality, both physical invariance and geometric invariance features of turbulent flows are embedded into the model input for classification and regression, and the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient is used as the output of the regression model. Different machine-learning methods and input setups have been used to test the classification model's performance. The F1-scores, which measure balanced precision and recall of a model, of the classification models with physical and geometric invariance embedded can be improved by about $17\%$ over those without considering geometric invariance. Regression models based on ensemble neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in predicting the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient, exceeding that of the dynamic Smagorinsky model in $\textit{a priori}$ tests.</description>

      <title>Conditional flow matching for generative modeling of near-wall turbulence with quantified uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing near-wall turbulence from wall-based measurements is a critical yet inherently ill-posed problem in wall-bounded flows, where limited sensing and spatially heterogeneous flow-wall coupling challenge deterministic estimation strategies. To address this, we introduce a novel generative modeling framework based on conditional flow matching for synthesizing instantaneous velocity fluctuation fields from wall observations, with explicit quantification of predictive uncertainty. Our method integrates continuous-time flow matching with a probabilistic forward operator trained using stochastic weight averaging Gaussian (SWAG), enabling zero-shot conditional generation without model retraining. We demonstrate that the proposed approach not only recovers physically realistic, statistically consistent turbulence structures across the near-wall region but also effectively adapts to various sensor configurations, including sparse, incomplete, and low-resolution wall measurements. The model achieves robust uncertainty-aware reconstruction, preserving flow intermittency and structure even under significantly degraded observability. Compared to classical linear stochastic estimation (LSE) and deterministic convolutional neural networks (CNN) methods, our stochastic generative learning framework exhibits superior generalization and resilience under measurement sparsity with quantified uncertainty. This work establishes a robust semi-supervised generative modeling paradigm for data-consistent flow reconstruction and lays the foundation for uncertainty-aware, sensor-driven modeling of wall-bounded turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present LBM-GNN, a novel approach that enhances the traditional Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply this method to fluid dynamics simulations, demonstrating improved stability and accuracy compared to standard LBM implementations. The method is validated using benchmark problems such as the Taylor-Green vortex, focusing on accuracy, conservation properties, and performance across different Reynolds numbers and grid resolutions. Our results indicate that GNN-enhanced LBM can maintain better conservation properties while improving numerical stability at higher Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>On the development of OpenFOAM solvers for simulating MHD micropolar fluid flows with or without the effect of micromagnetorotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces two new OpenFOAM solvers, epotMicropolarFoam and epotMMRFoam, developed for simulating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) micropolar flows with magnetic particles, such as blood. These solvers handle microrotation effects, with epotMMRFoam also accounting for the influence of micromagnetorotation (MMR). Both solvers utilize a transient approach and the PISO algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling, while adopting the low-magnetic-Reynolds-number approximation for the MHD simulations. Validation was conducted against analytical solutions of MHD micropolar Poiseuille blood flow, demonstrating excellent accuracy (error &lt; 2%). When the MMR is included, velocity and microrotation were significantly reduced (up to 40% and 99.9%, respectively), particularly under strong magnetic fields and high hematocrit values. In the absence of MMR, magnetic effects were minimal due to the blood's relatively low conductivity and small vessel size. MHD 3D artery blood flow simulations confirmed similar trends. The study suggests future extensions to incorporate thermal effects and alternative magnetization constitutive models. The solvers exhibit strong potential for biomedical applications such as magnetic hyperthermia and targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Asymptotics of Passive Scalar Transport in Periodically Modulated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotic behavior of a diffusing passive scalar advected by fluid flow in a straight channel with a periodically varying cross-section. The goal is to derive an asymptotic expansion for the scalar field and estimate the timescale over which this expansion remains valid, thereby generalizing Taylor dispersion theory to periodically modulated channels. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for the advection-diffusion operator on a unit cell and employing a biorthogonal eigenfunction expansion, we generalize the classical Fourier integral used in the flat-channel case to obtain an integral representation of the scalar field. This representation reveals a slow manifold that governs the algebraically decaying dynamics, while the difference between the scalar field and the slow manifold decays exponentially in time. Building on this, we derive a long-time asymptotic expansion of the scalar field. We show that the validity timescale of the expansion is determined by the real part of the eigenvalues of a modified advection-diffusion operator, which depends solely on the flow and geometry within a single unit cell. This framework offers a rigorous and systematic method for estimating mixing timescales in channels with complex geometries. We show that non-flat channel boundaries tend to increase the timescale, while transverse velocity components tend to decrease it. The approach developed here is broadly applicable and can be extended to derive long-time asymptotics for other systems with periodic coefficients or periodic microstructures.</description>

      <title>A novel hybrid neural network of fluid-structure interaction prediction for two cylinders in tandem arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown promise in improving computing efficiency while ensuring modeling accuracy in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis. However, its current capabilities are limited when it comes to constructing multi-object coupling systems with dynamic boundaries. To address such limitation, a novel FSI neural solver integrated by a fluid deep learning model with multi-time steps and a structural dynamic solver is proposed to accurately and reliably predict the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) evolution for two cylinders in tandem. This well-designed model in the form of end-to-end can precisely predict the instantaneous flow field state at the subsequent time by coupling the temporal flow fields of historical multi-time sequences and the current structural responses, moreover, derives the structural state at the next time. Furthermore, the novel fluid deep learning model consists of a wall shear model utilizing a multilayer perception network and flow field model with U-shaped architecture jointing the Fourier neural operator and modified convolution long-short term memory model. Both models effectively capture coupling transfer forces and predict instantaneous flow fields, with the latter demonstrating superior accuracy compared to Convolutional Neural Network- or Unet- based models with similar parameters. The prediction speed of the proposed models realizes an improvement of over 1000 times compared with the numerical simulation. Significantly, the proposed FSI neural model demonstrates exceptional capability in constructing the nonlinear complex multi- vibration systems and has substantial potential for advancing FSI modeling of flexible structures featuring pronounced nonlinear deformation boundaries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the partial differential equation (PDE) to which the pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann method (P-LBM) converges under diffusive scaling, providing a rigorous basis for its consistency analysis. By establishing a direct link between the method's parameters and physical properties-such as phase densities, interface thickness, and surface tension-we develop a framework that enables users to specify fluid properties directly in SI units, eliminating the need for empirical parameter tuning. This allows the simulation of problems with predefined physical properties, ensuring a direct and physically meaningful parametrization. The proposed approach is implemented in OpenLB, featuring a dedicated unit converter for multiphase problems. To validate the method, we perform benchmark tests-including planar interface, static droplet, Galilean invariance, and two-phase flow between parallel plates-using R134a as the working fluid, with all properties specified in physical units. The results demonstrate that the method achieves second-order convergence to the identified PDE, confirming its numerical consistency. These findings highlight the robustness and practicality of the P-LBM, paving the way for accurate and user-friendly simulations of complex multiphase systems with well-defined physical properties.</description>

      <title>The orientation dynamics of a massive ellipsoid in simple shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orientation dynamics of a massive rigid ellipsoid in simple shear flow of a Newtonian fluid is investigated in detail. The term `massive' refers to dominant particle inertia, as characterized by $St \gg 1$, $St = \dot{\gamma}l^2\rho_p/\nu \rho_f$ being the Stokes number; here, $\dot{\gamma}$ is the shear rate, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $l$ is a characteristic ellipsoidal dimension (taken to be the longest semi axis), and $\rho_p$ and $\rho_f$ are the particle and fluid densities, respectively. Fluid inertial effects are neglected, so the particle Reynolds number ($Re$) is zero. The equations of motion of the ellipsoid in this limit reduce to those governing an Euler top, supplemented by a weak viscous torque. The dynamics consists of a fast conservative motion on time scales of $O(\dot{\gamma}^{-1})$ that, for an ellipsoid, involves a combination of spin, precession and nutation, and a slower component driven by the viscous torque; the latter modulates the angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy on asymptotically longer time scales of $O(St{\dot{\gamma}}^{-1})$. The separation of time scales for large $St$ allows for use of the method of averaging for a triaxial ellipsoid, to derive an autonomous system of ODE's that govern motion on a four-dimensional slow manifold consisting of the three angular momenta and the rotational kinetic energy. There are three fixed points on the slow manifold, with rotation about the shortest axis being stable. The fixed point corresponding to rotation about the longest axis is a saddle point, while intermediate-axis-aligned rotation corresponds to a singular fixed point. For spheroids, the singular fixed point merges with one of the other two, leading to only two fixed points, one a stable node and the other a saddle; the former corresponds to rotation about the shorter axis.</description>

      <title>Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Control of Laminar Separation on a Wall-Bounded Airfoil at Transitional Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments were conducted in a low-turbulence wind tunnel to investigate the efficacy of localised acoustic forcing upon the dynamics and stability of the flow on a cambered, wall-bounded airfoil over a range of Reynolds numbers (Re) where the flow state can switch between two limits -- a low-lift state (SI) where separation continues beyond the trailing edge and a high-lift state (SII) where the separated flow is closed off to form a laminar separation bubble. The switching between SI and SII can occur close to a critical angle of attack ($\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$) which varies with $\textrm{Re}$. The most effective forcing frequencies are found at a constant value of a rescaled Strouhal number, $\textrm{St}^* = \textrm{St}/\textrm{Re}^{1/2}= 0.027$, which indicates that though the primary unstable modes of the separated shear layer are of the inviscid, Kelvin-Helmholtz type, these modes are seeded by length scales that originate in the laminar (viscous) boundary layer. The most effective chordwise forcing location varies with $\textrm{St}/\textrm{Re}^{1/2}$ and incidence angle, $\alpha$, and is always upstream of the separation point. Although the boundary layer flows are far from two-dimensional, forcing at a fixed chord location across all spanwise locations is effective in controlling the SI -- SII transition. Strategies for active and passive feedback control are suggested.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation-based Simultaneous Phase-Resolved Ocean Wave and Ship Motion Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-assimilation (DA)-based approach to forecast the phase-resolved wave evolution process and ship motion, which is developed by coupling the high-order spectral method (HOS), ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and a Cummins-equation-based ship model (CMI). With the developed EnKF-HOS-CMI method, the observation data for wave, ship, or both can be incorporated into the model, therefore producing the optimal analysis results. The developed method is validated and tested based on a synthetic problem on the motions of an irregular wave field and a box-shaped free-floating ship. We show that the EnKF-HOS-CMI method achieves much higher accuracy in the long-term simulation of nonlinear phase-resolved wave field and ship motion in comparison with the HOS-CMI method. Also, the ship parameters are estimated accurately by using a parameter-augmented state space in EnKF.</description>

      <title>Poroelastic flow across a permeable interface: a Hamilton's principle approach and its finite element implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fluid flow across a permeable interface within a deformable porous medium. We use mixture theory. The mixture's constituents are assumed to be incompressible in their pure form. We use Hamilton's principle to obtain the governing equations, and we propose a corresponding finite element implementation. The filtration velocity and the pore pressure are allowed to be discontinuous across the interface while some control of these discontinuities is built into the interfacial constitutive behavior. To facilitate the practical implementation of the formulation in a finite element scheme, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier field over the interface for the explicit enforcement of the jump condition of the balance of mass. Our formulation appears to recover some basic results from the literature. The novelty of the work is the formulation of an approach that can accommodate specific constitutive assumptions pertaining to the behavior of the interface that do not necessarily imply the continuity of the filtration velocity and/or of the pore pressure across it.</description>

      <title>An $rp$-adaptive method for accurate resolution of shock-dominated viscous flow based on implicit shock tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an optimization-based $rp$-adaptive numerical method to approximate solutions of viscous, shock-dominated flows using implicit shock tracking and a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization on traditionally coarse grids without nonlinear stabilization (e.g., artificial viscosity or limiting). The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking methods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution discontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers, functioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of $r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual with respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the grid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are proposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render stabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and modifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is used to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1) lessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers, (2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with the given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a majority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization. A series of numerical experiments show the proposed method effectively resolves viscous, shock-dominated flows, including accurate prediction of heat flux profiles produced by hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and compares favorably in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom to $h$-adaptation with a high-order discretization.</description>

      <title>Deformation and breakup of a ferrofluid compound droplet migrating in a microchannel under a magnetic field: A phase-field-based multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous in many engineering applications, including drug delivery, the compound droplet hydrodynamics in confined geometries have been barely surveyed. For the first time, this study thoroughly investigates the hydrodynamics of a ferrofluid compound droplet (FCD) during its migration in a microchannel under the presence of a pressure-driven flow and a uniform external magnetic field (UEMF) to manipulate its morphology and retard its breakup. Finite difference and phase-field multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann approaches are coupled to determine the magnetic field and ternary flow system, respectively. Firstly, the influence of the magnetic Bond number (Bo) on the FCD morphology is explored depending on whether the core or shell is ferrofluid when the UEMF is applied along {\alpha}=0{\deg} and {\alpha}=90{\deg} relative to the fluid flow. It is ascertained that imposing the UEMF at {\alpha}=0{\deg} when the shell is ferrofluid can postpone the breakup. Intriguingly, when the core is ferrofluid, strengthening the UEMF enlarges the shell deformation. Afterward, the effects of the Capillary number (Ca), density ratio, viscosity ratio, radius ratio, and surface tension coefficients are scrutinized on the FCD deformation and breakup. The results indicate that augmenting the core-to-shell viscosity and density ratios accelerates the breakup process. Additionally, surface tension between the core and shell suppresses the core deformation. Moreover, increasing the Ca number intensifies the viscous drag force exerted on the shell, flattening its rear side, which causes a triangular-like configuration. Ultimately, by varying Bo and Ca numbers, five distinguished regimes are observed, whose regime map is established.</description>

      <title>Marangoni flow driven hysteresis and azimuthal symmetry breaking in evaporating binary droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-uniform evaporation rate at the liquid-gas interface of binary droplets induces solutal Marangoni flows. In glycerol-water mixtures (positive Marangoni number, where the more volatile fluid has higher surface tension), these flows stabilise into steady patterns. Conversely, in water-ethanol mixtures (negative Marangoni number, where the less volatile fluid has higher surface tension), Marangoni instabilities emerge, producing seemingly chaotic flows. This behaviour arises from the opposing signs of the Marangoni number. Perturbations locally reducing surface tension at the interface drive Marangoni flows away from the perturbed region. Incompressibility enforces a return flow, drawing fluid from the bulk towards the interface. In mixtures with a negative Marangoni number, preferential evaporation of the lower-surface-tension component leads to a higher concentration of the higher-surface-tension component at the interface as compared to the bulk. The return flow therefore creates a positive feedback loop, further reducing surface tension and enhancing the instability. We investigate bistable quasi-stationary solutions in evaporating binary droplets with negative Marangoni numbers and we examine symmetry breaking across a range of Marangoni number and contact angles. Remarkably, droplets with low contact angle show instabilities at lower critical Marangoni numbers than droplets with larger contact angles. Our numerical simulations reveal that interactions between droplet height profiles and non-uniform evaporation rates trigger azimuthal Marangoni instabilities in flat droplets. This geometrically confined instability can even destabilise mixtures with positive Marangoni numbers, particularly for concave liquid-gas interfaces. Finally, through Lyapunov exponent analysis, we confirm the chaotic nature of flows in droplets with a negative Marangoni number.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Ideal Single Vortex Flows Using the Differentiable Vortex Particle Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study extends the differentiable vortex particle method (DVPM) beyond idealized flow scenarios to encompass more realistic, non-ideal conditions, including viscous flow and flow subjected to non-conservative body forces. We establish the Lamb-Oseen vortex as a benchmark case, representing a fundamental viscous single vortex flow in fluid mechanics. This selection offers significant analytical advantages, as the Lamb-Oseen vortex possesses an exact analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, thereby providing definitive ground truth data for training and validation purposes. Through rigorous evaluation across a spectrum of Reynolds numbers, we demonstrate that DVPM achieves superior accuracy in modeling the Lamb-Oseen vortex compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our results substantiate DVPM's robust capabilities in modeling non-ideal single vortex flows, establishing its distinct advantages over contemporary deep learning methodologies in fluid dynamics applications.

      <title>Fine-tuning a Large Language Model for Automating Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations typically demands extensive domain expertise, limiting broader access. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced scientific computing, their use in automating CFD workflows is underdeveloped. We introduce a novel approach centered on domain-specific LLM adaptation. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on NL2FOAM, our custom dataset of 28716 natural language-to-OpenFOAM configuration pairs with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, we enable direct translation from natural language descriptions to executable CFD setups. A multi-agent framework orchestrates the process, autonomously verifying inputs, generating configurations, running simulations, and correcting errors. Evaluation on a benchmark of 21 diverse flow cases demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.7% solution accuracy and 82.6% first-attempt success rate. This significantly outperforms larger general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while also requiring fewer correction iterations and maintaining high computational efficiency. The results highlight the critical role of domain-specific adaptation in deploying LLM assistants for complex engineering workflows. Our code and fine-tuned model have been deposited at https://github.com/YYgroup/AutoCFD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved approach for preserving sharp interfaces in multiphase Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulations using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Interface diffusion is a common challenge in multiphase LBM, leading to reduced accuracy in simulating phenomena where interfacial dynamics are critical. We propose a coupled PINN-LBM framework that maintains interface sharpness while preserving the physical accuracy of the simulation. Our approach is validated through droplet simulations, with quantitative metrics measuring interface width, maximum gradient, phase separation, effective interface width, and interface energy. The enhanced visualization techniques employed in this work clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PINN-LBM over standard LBM for multiphase simulations, particularly in maintaining well-defined interfaces throughout the simulation. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the results, showcasing how the neural network integration effectively counteracts numerical diffusion, while maintaining physical consistency with the underlying fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator framework for the fast prediction of turbulent flows with mixed periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient predictions of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows are of significant importance in the fields of science and engineering. In the current work, we propose a hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator (HUFNO) method, tailored for mixed periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions which are often encountered in complex turbulence problems. The HUFNO model is tested in the large-eddy simulation (LES) of 3D periodic hill turbulence featuring strong flow separations. Compared to the original Fourier neural operator (FNO) and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based U-Net framework, the HUFNO model has a higher accuracy in the predictions of the velocity field and Reynolds stresses. Further numerical experiments in the LES show that the HUFNO framework outperforms the traditional Smagorinsky (SMAG) model and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of the turbulence statistics, the energy spectrum, the wall stresses and the flow separation structures, with much lower computational cost. Importantly, the accuracy and efficiency are transferable to unseen initial conditions and hill shapes, underscoring its great potentials for the fast prediction of strongly separated turbulent flows over curved boundaries.</description>
