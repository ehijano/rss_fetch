      <title>The Boundary Harnack Principle and the 3G Principle in Fractal-Type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalized version of the $3G$ Principle for Green's functions on bounded inner uniform domains in a wide class of Dirichlet spaces. In particular, our results apply to higher-dimensional fractals such as Sierpinski carpets in $\mathbf{R}^n$, $n\geq 3$, as well as generalized fractal-type spaces that do not have a well-defined Hausdorff dimension or walk dimension. This yields new instances of the $3G$ Principle for these spaces. We also discuss applications to Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <title>The martingale problem for geometric stable-like processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the martingale problem is well posed for pure-jump L\'evy-type operators of the form $$ (\mathcal Lf)(x) = \int_{\mathbb R^d \setminus \{0\}} \left(f(x+h)-f(x) - (\nabla f(x) \cdot h)1_{\|h\| &lt; 1}\right)K(x,h) dh, $$ where $K(x,\cdot)$ is a jump kernel of the form $K(x,h) \sim \frac{l(\|h\|)}{\|h\|^d}$ for each $x \in \mathbb R^d,\|h\|&lt;1$, and $l$ is a positive function that is slowly varying at $0$, under suitable assumptions on $K$. This includes jump kernels such as those of $\alpha$-geometric stable processes, $\alpha \in (0,2]$.</description>

      <title>Additive processes on the real line and Loewner chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates additive processes with respect to several different independences in non-commutative probability in terms of the convolution hemigroups of the distributions of the increments of the processes. In particular, we focus on the relation of monotone convolution hemigroups and chordal Loewner chains, a special kind of family of conformal mappings. Generalizing the celebrated Loewner differential equation, we introduce the concept of ``generator'' for a class of Loewner chains. The locally uniform convergence of Loewner chains is then equivalent to a suitable convergence of generators. Using generators, we define homeomorphisms between the aforementioned class of chordal Loewner chains, the set of monotone convolution hemigroups with finite second moment, and the set of classical convolution hemigroups on the real line with finite second moment. Moreover, we define similar homeomorphisms between classical, free, and boolean convolution hemigroups on the real line, but without any assumptions on the moments.</description>

      <title>Tail Dependence of Multivariate Archimedean Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Archimedean copulas generated by Laplace transforms have been extensively studied in the literature, with much of the focus on tail dependence limited only to cases where the Laplace transforms exhibit regular variation with positive tail indices. In this paper, we extend the investigation to include Archimedean copulas associated with both slowly varying and rapidly varying Laplace transforms. We show that tail dependence functions with various tail orders effectively capture the extremal dependence across the entire class of Archimedean copulas, reflecting the full spectrum of tail behaviors exhibited by the underlying Laplace transforms.</description>

      <title>The Rank and Singular Values of the Inhomogeneous Subgaussian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A be an n*n random matrix with mean zero and independent inhomogeneous non-constant subgaussian entries. We get that for some k, the probability of the matrix has a lower rank than $n-k$ that is sub-exponential.Furthermore, we get a deviation inequality for the singular values of A in this paper.
  This extends earlier results of Rudelson's paper in 2024 by removing the assumption of the identical distribution of the entries across the matrix. Our model covers inhomogeneous matrices, allowing different subgaussian moments for the entries as long as their subgaussian moments have a standard upper bound
  In the past advance, the assumption of i.i.d entries was required due to the lack of least common denominators of the non-i.i.d random matrix. We can overcome this problem using a Randomized least common denominator (RLCD) from Livshyts in 2021.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates of the singular values of random i.i.d. matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ random i.i.d. matrix. This paper studies the deviation inequality of $s_{n-k+1}(M)$, the $k$-th smallest singular value of $M$. In particular, when the entries of $M$ are subgaussian, we show that for any $\gamma\in (0, 1/2), \varepsilon&gt;0$ and $\log n\le k\le c\sqrt{n}$
  \begin{align}
  \textsf{P}\{s_{n-k+1}(M)\le \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{n}} \}\le \Big( \frac{C\varepsilon}{k}\Big)^{\gamma k^{2}}+e^{-c_{1}kn}.\nonumber
  \end{align}
  This result improves an existing result of Nguyen, which obtained a deviation inequality of $s_{n-k+1}(M)$ with $(C\varepsilon/k)^{\gamma k^{2}}+e^{-cn}$ decay.</description>

      <title>On decomposition problem for distribution functions of class $\boldsymbol{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a new class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ of distribution functions $F$ that have the property of rational-infinite divisibility: there exist some infinitely divisible distribution functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $F_1=F*F_2$. A distribution function of the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is quasi-infinitely divisible in the sense that its characteristic function admits the L\'evy--Khinchine type representation with a ``signed spectral measure''. The class $\boldsymbol{Q}$, being a natural extension of the class $\boldsymbol{I}$ of infinitely divisible distribution functions, is actively studied now and it finds various applications. In 2018, Lindner, Pan and Sato formulated the open question: is it true that if $F\in\boldsymbol{Q}$ and $F=F_1*F_2$ with some distribution functions $F_1$ and $F_2$, then $F_1\in\boldsymbol{Q}$ and $F_2\in\boldsymbol{Q}$? There are some positive results under special assumptions on the type of $F$. In this paper, we answer the question in a general setting without any additional assumptions. We also consider the same question but with the stronger assumption that $F\in\boldsymbol{I}$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for eventually continuous Markov--Feller semigroups on Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ergodicity of Markov--Feller semigroups on Polish spaces, focusing on very weak regularity conditions, particularly the Ces\`aro eventual continuity. First, it is showed that the Ces\`aro average of such semigroups weakly converges to an ergodic measure when starting from its support. This leads to a characterization of the relationship between Ces\`aro eventual continuity, Ces\`aro e-property, and weak-* mean ergodicity. Next, serval criteria are provided for the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures via Ces\`aro eventual continuity and lower bound conditions, establishing an equivalence relation between weak-* mean ergodicity and a lower bound condition. Additionally, some refined properties of ergodic decomposition are derived. Finally, the results are applied to several non-trivial examples, including iterated function systems, Hopf's turbulence model with random forces, and Lorenz system with noisy perturbations, either with or without Ces\`aro eventual continuity.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin Calculus Approach to Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions to multi-dimensional backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), whose (possibly random) generator reflects nonlinear dependence on both the solution process and the martingale integrand component of the adapted solutions, as well as their diagonal processes. The well-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which renders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes while contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semilinear partial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of BSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize dynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment opportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands being identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in low-dimensional long-range random field Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-range random field Ising model in dimension $d = 1, 2$, whereas the long-range interaction is of the form $J_{xy} = |x-y|^{-\alpha}$ with $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 3/2$ for $d=1$ and with $2 &lt; \alpha \leq 3$ for $d = 2$. Our main results establish phase transitions in these regimes. In one dimension, we employ a Peierls argument with some novel modification, suitable for dealing with the randomness coming from the external field; in two dimensions, our proof follows that of Affonso, Bissacot, and Maia (2023) with some adaptations, but new ideas are required in the critical case of $\alpha=3$.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics of inhomogeneous random graphs with graphon limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish central limit theorems (CLTs) for the linear spectral statistics of the adjacency matrix of inhomogeneous random graphs across all sparsity regimes, providing explicit covariance formulas under the assumption that the variance profile of the random graphs converges to a graphon limit. Two types of CLTs are derived for the (non-centered) adjacency matrix and the centered adjacency matrix, with different scaling factors when the sparsity parameter $p$ satisfies $np = n^{\Omega(1)}$, and with the same scaling factor when $np = n^{o(1)}$. In both cases, the limiting covariance is expressed in terms of homomorphism densities from certain types of finite graphs to a graphon. These results highlight a phase transition in the centering effect for global eigenvalue fluctuations. For the non-centered adjacency matrix, we also identify new phase transitions for the CLTs in the sparse regime when $n^{1/m} \ll np \ll n^{1/(m-1)}$ for $m \geq 2$. Furthermore, weaker conditions for the graphon convergence of the variance profile are sufficient as $p$ decreases from being constant to $np \to c\in (0,\infty)$. These findings reveal a novel connection between graphon limits and linear spectral statistics in random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric ergodicity of modified Euler schemes for SDEs with super-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a well-known fact, the classical Euler scheme works merely for SDEs with coefficients of linear growth. In this paper, we study a general framework of modified Euler schemes, which is applicable to SDEs with super-linear drifts and encompasses numerical methods such as the tamed Euler scheme and the truncated Euler scheme. On the one hand, by exploiting an approach based on the refined basic coupling, we show that all Euler recursions within our proposed framework are geometrically ergodic under a mixed probability distance (i.e., the total variation distance plus the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance) and the weighted total variation distance. On the other hand, by utilizing the coupling by reflection, we demonstrate that the tamed Euler scheme is geometrically ergodic under the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance. In addition, as an important application, we provide a quantitative $L^1$-Wasserstein error bound between the exact invariant probability measure of an SDE with super-linearity, and the invariant probability measure of the tamed Euler scheme which is its numerical counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mixed long-range percolation on the square lattice. Each vertical edge of unit length is independently open with probability $\varepsilon$, and each horizontal edge of length $i$ is independently open with probability $p_i$. Also, each vertex is assigned independently a random variable taking values 1 and 0 with probability $p$ and $1-p$, respectively. We prove that for a broad class of anisotropic long-range percolation models for which connection probabilities $p_i$ satisfy some regularity conditions, all words (semi-infinite binary sequences) are seen simultaneously from the origin with positive probability, even if all edges with length larger than some constant (depending on $\varepsilon$, $p$, and on the sequence $(p_i)$) are suppressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the issue of uniform measure attractors for non-autonomous McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations defined on unbounded thin domains. Initially, the concept of uniform measure attractors is recalled, and thereafter, the existence and uniqueness of such attractors are demonstrated. Uniform tail estimates are employed to establish the asymptotic compactness of the processes, thereby overcoming the non-compactness issue inherent in the usual Sobolev embedding on unbounded thin domains. Finally, we demonstrate that the upper semi-continuity of uniform measure attractors defined on $(n + 1)$-dimensional unbounded thin domains collapsing into the space $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>Weak lumping of left-invariant random walks on left cosets of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. The left-invariant random walk driven by a probability measure $w$ on $G$ is the Markov chain in which from any state $x \in G$, the probability of stepping to $xg \in G$ is $w(g)$. The initial state is chosen randomly according to a given distribution. The walk is said to lump weakly on left cosets if the induced process on $G/H$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain. We characterise all the initial distributions and weights $w$ such that the walk is irreducible and lumps weakly on left cosets, and determine all the possible transition matrices of the induced Markov chain. In the case where $H$ is abelian we refine our main results to give a necessary and sufficient condition for weak lumping by an explicit system of linear equations on $w$, organized by the double cosets $HxH$. As an application we consider shuffles of a deck of $n$ cards such that repeated observations of the top card form a Markov chain. Such shuffles include the random-to-top shuffle, and also, when the deck is started in a uniform random order, the top-to-random shuffle. We give a further family of examples in which our full theory of weak lumping is needed to verify that the top card sequence is Markov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To what extent is the underlying distribution of a finitely supported unbiased random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ determined by the sequence of times at which the walk returns to the origin? The main result of this paper is that, in various senses, most unbiased random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ are determined up to equivalence by the sequence $I_1,I_2,I_3,\ldots$, where $I_n$ denotes the probability of being at the origin after $n$ steps. The proof depends on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Entropic adapted Wasserstein distance on Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein distance is a metric for quantifying distributional uncertainty and assessing the sensitivity of stochastic optimization problems on time series data. A computationally efficient alternative to it, is provided by the entropically regularized adapted Wasserstein distance. Suffering from similar shortcomings as classical optimal transport, there are only few explicitly known solutions to those distances.
  Recently, Gunasingam--Wong provided a closed-form representation of the adapted Wasserstein distance between real-valued stochastic processes with Gaussian laws. In this paper, we extend their work in two directions, by considering multidimensional ($\mathbb{R}^d$-valued) stochastic processes with Gaussian laws and including the entropic regularization. In both settings, we provide closed-form solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic control problem with regime switching arising in an optimal liquidation problem with dark pools and multiple regimes. The new feature of this model is that it introduces a system of BSDEs with jumps and with singular terminal values, which appears in literature for the first time. The existence result for this system is obtained. As a result, we solve the stochastic control problem with regime switching. More importantly, the uniqueness result of this system is also obtained, in contrast to merely minimal solutions established in most related literature.</description>

      <title>Constrained stochastic linear quadratic control under regime switching with controlled jump size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a stochastic linear-quadratic control problem characterized by regime switching and Poisson jumps. All the coefficients in the problem are random processes adapted to the filtration generated by Brownian motion and the Poisson random measure for each given regime. The model incorporates two distinct types of controls: the first is a conventional control that appears in the continuous diffusion component, while the second is an unconventional control, dependent on the variable $z$, which influences the jump size in the jump diffusion component. Both controls are constrained within general closed cones. By employing the Meyer-It\^o formula in conjunction with a generalized squares completion technique, we rigorously and explicitly derive the optimal value and optimal feedback control. These depend on solutions to certain multi-dimensional fully coupled stochastic Riccati equations, which are essentially backward stochastic differential equations with jumps (BSDEJs). We establish the existence of a unique nonnegative solution to the BSDEJs. One of the major tools used in the proof is the newly established comparison theorems for multidimensional BSDEJs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study weak well-posedness of a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) whose drift is density-dependent and whose diffusion is constant. The existence part is due to H\"older stability estimates of the associated Euler-Maruyama scheme. The uniqueness part is due to that of the associated Fokker-Planck equation. We also obtain convergence rate in weighted $L^1$ norm for the Euler-Maruyama scheme.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and zeroes of $L$-functions via probability in $\lambda$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings designed to efficiently describe random variables valued in multisets of complex numbers, varieties over a field, or other similar enriched settings. A key role is played by the $\sigma$-moment generating function based on the plethystic exponential, which allows us to describe distributions and argue with independence in a way that is as simple as classical probability theory. As a first application, we use this theory to obtain a concise description of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions describing distributions of eigenvalues of Haar random matrices in compact classical groups. Beyond the theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings, the proof uses only classical invariant theory. Using our description we reprove the results of Diaconis and Shahshahani on the joint distributions of traces of powers of matrices, and we also treat symmetric groups. Next, we use Poonen's sieve to establish equidistribution results for the zeroes of $L$-functions in some natural families: simple Dirichlet characters for $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$ and the vanishing cohomology of smooth hypersurface sections. We give concise descriptions of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions in these families, then compare them to the associated random matrix distributions. These equidistribution results are sideways in that we fix $q$ and take the degree $d$ to infinity, as opposed to Deligne equidistribution for fixed $d$ as $q \rightarrow \infty$, and the large $d$-limits are related to explicit descriptions of stable homology with twisted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for vector-valued composite functionals with smoothing and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on vector-valued composite functionals, which may be nonlinear in probability. Our primary goal is to establish central limit theorems for these functionals when mixed estimators are employed. Our study is relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning methods. A generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which encompasses most of the known coherent risk measures including systemic measures of risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze vector-valued functionals, providing a framework for evaluating high-dimensional risks. This framework facilitates the comparison of multiple risk measures, as well as the estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic risk and its optimal value in decision-making problems. Second, we derive novel central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals when mixed types of estimators: empirical and smoothed estimators are used. We provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the central limit formulae and show their applicability to several popular measures of risk.</description>

      <title>Game theoretical asymptotic mean value properties for non-homogeneous $p$-Laplace problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical mean value property for the Laplacian operator to address a nonlinear and non-homogeneous problem related to the $p$-Laplacian operator for $p&gt;2$. Specifically, we characterize viscosity solutions to the $p$-Laplace equation $\Delta_p u:=\nabla\cdot(|\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u) = f$ with a nontrivial right-hand side $f$, through novel asymptotic mean value formulas. While asymptotic mean value formulas for the homogeneous case ($f = 0$) have been previously established, leveraging the normalization $\Delta_p^{\text{N}}u:=|\nabla u|^{2-p} \Delta_p u = 0$, which yields the 1-homogeneous normalized $p$-Laplacian, such normalization is not applicable when $f \neq 0$. Furthermore, the mean value formulas introduced here motivate, for the first time in the literature, a game-theoretical approach for non-homogeneous $p$-Laplace equations. We also analyze the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of the game values, which are solutions to a dynamic programming principle derived from the mean value property.</description>

      <title>Conjugation, loop and closure invariants of the iterated-integrals signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a feature set for the shape of a closed loop, it is natural to ask which features in that set do not change when the starting point of the path is moved. For example, in two dimensions, the area enclosed by the path does not depend on the starting point. In the present article, we characterize such loop invariants among all those features known as interated integrals of a given path. Furthermore, we relate these to conjugation invariants, which are a canonical object of study when treating (tree reduced) paths as a group with multiplication given by the concatenation. Finally, closure invariants are a third class in this context which is of particular relevance when studying piecewise linear trajectories, e.g. given by linear interpolation of time series.
  Keywords: invariant features; concatenation of paths; combinatorial necklaces; shuffle algebra; free Lie algebra; signed area; signed volume; tree-like equivalence.</description>

Abstract: The functionality of a graph $G$ is the minimum number $k$ such that in every induced subgraph of $G$ there exists a vertex whose neighbourhood is uniquely determined by the neighborhoods of at most $k$ other vertices in the subgraph. The functionality parameter was introduced in the context of adjacency labeling schemes, and it generalises a number of classical and recent graph parameters including degeneracy, twin-width, and symmetric difference. We establish the functionality of a random graph $G(n,p)$ up to a constant factor for every value of $p$.</description>

      <title>LASER: A new method for locally adaptive nonparametric regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce \textsf{LASER} (Locally Adaptive Smoothing Estimator for Regression), a computationally efficient locally adaptive nonparametric regression method that performs variable bandwidth local polynomial regression. We prove that it adapts (near-)optimally to the local H\"{o}lder exponent of the underlying regression function \texttt{simultaneously} at all points in its domain. Furthermore, we show that there is a single ideal choice of a global tuning parameter under which the above mentioned local adaptivity holds. Despite the vast literature on nonparametric regression, instances of practicable methods with provable guarantees of such a strong notion of local adaptivity are rare. The proposed method achieves excellent performance across a broad range of numerical experiments in comparison to popular alternative locally adaptive methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and G\'acs. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.</description>

      <title>The *-Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-reversible generalization of the Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process (VRJP), called the *-Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process (*-VRJP) and introduced by Bacallado, Sabot and Tarr\`es (2020). It can be seen as the continuous-time counterpart to the *-Edge-Reinforced Random Walk (*-ERRW), see Bacallado (2011) and Bacallado, Sabot and Tarr\`es (2020), which is itself a non-reversible, and in fact Yaglom reversible, generalization of the original ERRW introduced by Coppersmith and Diaconis (1986). In contrast to the classical VRJP, the *-VRJP is not exchangeable after time-change, which leads to several difficulties and new phenomena.
  Firstly, we show that with some appropriate randomization of the initial local time, it becomes partially exchangeable after time-change. We provide a representation of the "randomized" *-VRJP as a mixture of Yaglom reversible Markov jump processes with an explicit mixing measure, and we prove that the non-randomized *-VRJP can be written as a mixture of conditioned Markov processes.
  Secondly, we give a representation of the *-VRJP in terms of a random Schr\"odinger operator. The corresponding representation for the classical VRJP has proved to be very useful in the understanding of its asymptotic behavior. The construction is based on several new and rather remarkable identities between integrals on the space of *-symmetric and *-antisymmetric functions on vertices. We give a description of the randomized *-VRJP in terms of that random Schr\"odinger operator, which allows us to prove the representation of the randomized *-VRJP as a mixture of Markov jump processes in a different and more analytic manner. Similarly as for the VRJP, we think that the representation by a random Schr\"odinger operator and the associated identities are key-features of the *-VRJP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the analysis, initiated in the paper *-VRJP I, of the *-Vertex Reinforced Jump Process (*-VRJP), which is a non reversible generalization of the Vertex Reinforced Jump Process (VRJP). More precisely, we give a representation of the *-VRJP in terms of a random Schr\"odinger operator. The corresponding representation for the classical VRJP has proved to be very useful in the understanding of its asymptotic behavior. Several new phenomena and difficulties appear in this non reversible case due to the non exchangeability of the *-VRJP, which becomes exchangeable only after some randomization of the initial local times as proved in the companion paper. The construction is based on several new and rather remarkable identities between integrals on the space of *-symmetric and *-antisymmetric functions on vertices. We give a description of the randomized *-VRJP in terms of that random Schr\"odinger operator, which allow us to prove the representation of the randomized *-VRJP as mixture of Markov jump processes in a different and more analytic way. Similarly as for the VRJP, we think that the representation by a random Schr\"odinger operator and the associated identities are key-features of the *-VRJP.</description>

      <title>An extension of the cogrowth formula to arbitrary subsets of the tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the probability that a random walk in the free group ends in a proper power? Or in a primitive element? We present a formula that computes the exponential decay rate of the probability that a random walk on a regular tree ends in a given subset, in terms of the exponential decay rate of the analogous probability of the non-backtracking random walk. This generalizes the well-known cogrowth formula of Grigorchuk, Cohen and Northshield. We also extend the formula to arbitrary subsets of the biregular tree.</description>

      <title>The Accumulation of Beneficial Mutations and Convergence to a Poisson Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of a population with fixed size $N$, which is subjected to an unlimited supply of beneficial mutations at a constant rate $\mu_N$. Individuals with $k$ beneficial mutations have the fitness $(1+s_N)^k$. Each individual dies at rate 1 and is replaced by a random individual chosen with probability proportional to its fitness. We show that when $\mu_N \ll 1/(N \log N)$ and $N^{-\eta} \ll s_N \ll 1$ for some $\eta &lt; 1$, the fixation times of beneficial mutations, after a time scaling, converge to the times of a Poisson process, even though for some choices of $s_N$ and $\mu_N$ satisfying these conditions, there will sometimes be multiple beneficial mutations with distinct origins in the population, competing against each other.</description>

      <title>SLE Loop Measure and Liouville Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As recently shown by Holden and two of the authors, the conformal welding of two Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disks produces a canonical variant of SLE curve whose law is called the SLE loop measure. In this paper, we demonstrate how LQG can be used to study the SLE loop measure. Firstly, we show that for $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$, the loop intensity measure of the conformal loop ensemble agrees with the SLE loop measure as defined by Zhan (2021). The former was initially considered by Kemppainen and Werner (2016) for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$, and the latter was constructed for $\kappa\in (0,8)$. Secondly, we establish a duality for the SLE loop measure between $\kappa$ and $16/\kappa$. Thirdly, we obtain the exact formula for the moment of the electrical thickness for the shape (probability) measure of the SLE loop, which in the regime $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$ was conjectured by Kenyon and Wilson (2004). This relies on the exact formulae for the reflection coefficient and the one-point disk correlation function in Liouville conformal field theory. Finally, we compute several multiplicative constants associated with the SLE loop measure, which are not only of intrinsic interest but also used in our companion paper relating the conformal loop ensemble to the imaginary DOZZ formulae.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Means in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there exists a well-developed asymptotic theory of Fr\'echet means of random variables taking values in a general "finite-dimensional" metric space, there are only a few known results in which the random variables can take values in an "infinite-dimensional" metric space. Presently, we fill this gap by proving a fundamental continuity theorem for Fr\'echet means in metric spaces which admit a suitably powerful notion of "weak convergence". This allows us to recover, strengthen, and generalize all known asymptotic theory for Fr\'echet means; in particular, we expand the possible geometric settings where such theory can be applied, we reduce the moment assumptions to the provably minimal possible, and we completely remove assumptions about uniqueness of the Fr\'echet mean. We also analyze many examples.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value of large random rectangular Toeplitz and circulant matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $x_i$, $i\in\mathbb{Z}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. standard normal random variables. Consider rectangular Toeplitz $\mathbf{X}=\left(x_{j-i}\right)_{1\leq i\leq p,1\leq j\leq n}$ and circulant $\mathbf{X}=\left(x_{(j-i)\mod n}\right)_{1\leq i\leq p,1\leq j\leq n}$ matrices. Let $p,n\rightarrow\infty$ so that $p/n\rightarrow c\in(0,1]$. We prove that the smallest eigenvalue of $\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^\top$ converges to zero in probability and in expectation. We establish a lower bound on the rate of this convergence. The lower bound is faster than any poly-log but slower than any polynomial rate. For the ``rectangular circulant'' matrices, we also establish a polynomial upper bound on the convergence rate, which is a simple explicit function of $c$.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Conformal Loop Ensemble: Imaginary DOZZ Formula and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scaling limit of the probability that $n$ points are on the same cluster for 2D critical percolation is believed to be governed by a conformal field theory (CFT). Although this is not fully understood, Delfino and Viti (2010) made a remarkable prediction on the exact value of a properly normalized three-point probability. It is expressed in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula of Schomerus, Zamolodchikov and Kostov-Petkova, which extends the structure constants of minimal model CFTs to continuous parameters. Later, similar conjectures were made for scaling limits of random cluster models and O$(n)$ loop models, representing certain three-point observables in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula. Since the scaling limits of these models can be described by the conformal loop ensemble (CLE), such conjectures can be formulated as exact statements on CLE observables. In this paper, we prove Delfino and Viti's conjecture on percolation as well as a conjecture of Ikhlef, Jacobsen and Saleur (2015) on the nesting loop statistics of CLE. Our proof is based on the coupling between CLE and Liouville quantum gravity on the sphere, and is inspired by the fact that after reparametrization, the imaginary DOZZ formula is the reciprocal of the three-point function of Liouville CFT. Recently, Nivesvivat, Jacobsen and Ribault systematically studied a CFT with a large class of CLE observables as its correlation functions, including the ones from these two conjectures. We believe that our framework admits sufficient flexibility to exactly solve the three-point functions for CLE observables with natural geometric interpretations, including those from this CFT. As a demonstration, we solve the case corresponding to three points lying on the same loop, where the answer is a variant of the imaginary DOZZ formula.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Erd\H{o}s primitive set conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of integers greater than 1 is primitive if no member in the set divides another. Erd\H{o}s proved in 1935 that the series $f(A) = \sum_{a\in A}1/(a \log a)$ is uniformly bounded over all choices of primitive sets $A$. In 1986 he asked if this bound is attained for the set of prime numbers. In this article we answer in the affirmative. As further applications of the method, we make progress towards a question of Erd\H{o}s, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi from 1968. We also refine the classical Davenport-Erd\H{o}s theorem on infinite divisibility chains, and extend a result of Erd\H{o}s, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi from 1966.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive new formulas for the expectation and variance of Wilson loops for any contractible simple loop on a compact orientable surface of genus $1$ and higher, in the model of two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$. They are written in terms of a Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ introduced recently by the author and M. Ma\"ida \cite{LM3}. From these formulas, we prove a quantitative result on the convergence of the expectation and variance as $N$ tends to infinity, refining a result of the author and A. Dahlqvist \cite{DL}. We finally derive the large $g$ limit of the Wilson loop expectation and variance, by analogy with the study of integrals on moduli spaces of compact hyperbolic surfaces. Surprisingly, the variance does not vanish in this regime, but there are no nontrivial fluctuations of any order.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence rates for a full discretization of stochastic wave equation with nonlinear damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes the strong convergence rates of a spatio-temporal full discretization of the stochastic wave equation with nonlinear damping in dimension one and two. We discretize the SPDE by applying a spectral Galerkin method in space and a modified implicit exponential Euler scheme in time. The presence of the super-linearly growing damping in the underlying model brings challenges into the error analysis. To address these difficulties, we first achieve upper mean-square error bounds, and then obtain mean-square convergence rates of the considered numerical solution. This is done without requiring the moment bounds of the full approximations. The main result shows that, in dimension one, the scheme admits a convergence rate of order $\tfrac12$ in space and order $1$ in time. In dimension two, the error analysis is more subtle and can be done at the expense of an order reduction due to an infinitesimal factor. Numerical experiments are performed and confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For time-inconsistent stopping in a one-dimensional diffusion setup, we investigate how to use discrete-time models to approximate the original problem. In particular, we consider the value function $V(\cdot)$ induced by all mild equilibria in the continuous-time problem, as well as the value $V^h(\cdot)$ associated with the equilibria in a binomial-tree setting with time step size $h$. We show that $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0+} V^h \leq V$. We provide an example showing that the exact convergence may fail. Then we relax the set of equilibria and consider the value $V^h_{\varepsilon}(\cdot)$ induced by $\varepsilon$-equilibria in the binomial-tree model. We prove that $\lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0+}\lim_{h \rightarrow 0+}V^h_{\varepsilon} = V$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which respects the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time -- hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, following the recent work of Fathi (2018) in the classical case, we provide by two different methods a sharp symmetrized free Talagrand inequality for the semicircular law, which improves the free TCI of Biane and Voiculescu (2000). The first proof holds only in the one-dimensional case and has the advantage of providing a connection with the machinery of free moment maps introduced by Bahr and Boschert (2023) and a free reverse Log-Sobolev inequality. This case also and sheds light on a dual formulation via the free version of the functional Blaschke-Santalo inequality. The second proof gives the result in a multidimensional setting and relies on a random matrix approximation approach developed by Biane (2003), Hiai, Petz and Ueda (2004) combined with Fathi's inequality on Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the variance of both smooth linear statistics and rough linear statistics (counting statistics) of random normal matrices. The two classical ensembles of random matrices, the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) and the complex Ginibre ensemble, enjoy an exact map to the ground state of noninteracting Fermions in a harmonic trap in one, respectively two dimensions. Both feature that the variance of the number of Fermions (the number variance) in a set $A$, and the respective entanglement entropy are proportional. For the Ginibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial symmetric sets $A$, and we prove it in generality for subsets $A$ of the bulk, thus establishing a holographic principle. Moreover, for generic random normal matrix ensembles depending on some potential $V$, not necessarily exhibiting radial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is proportional to the circumference of $A$, $\sim\sqrt{n}|\partial A|$. A special focus is on the variance of linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, which interpolates between the GUE and Ginibre ensemble, in various regimes of non-Hermiticity, where we enlarge the concept of weak non-Hermiticity to mesoscopic scales. Within the elliptic Ginibre ensemble we prove that for smooth test functions $f$ its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble. The interpolation depends on two positive parameters, the rescaling $\alpha$ of the weak non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau=1-\kappa n^{-\alpha}$, and the rescaling $\gamma$ of the test function $f(n^\gamma z)$, for a continuous range of values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. In the mesoscopic regime and when $\alpha=\gamma&lt;1$, we prove an interpolating central limit theorem with an adaptation of the method of Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Appointment Scheduling in the Presence of Patient Unpunctuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal appointment scheduling problem that incorporates patients' unpunctual behavior, where the unpunctuality is assumed to be time dependent, but additive. Our goal is to develop an optimal scheduling method for a large patient system to maximize expected net revenue. Methods for deriving optimal appointment schedules for large-scale systems often run into computational bottlenecks due to mixed-integer programming or robust optimization formulations and computationally complex search methods. In this work, we model the system as a single-server queueing system, where patients arrive unpunctually and follow the FIFO service discipline to see the doctor (i.e., get into service). Using the heavy traffic fluid approximation, we develop a deterministic control problem, referred to as the fluid control problem (FCP), which serves as an asymptotic upper bound for the original queueing control problem (QCP). Using the optimal solution of the FCP, we establish an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy on a fluid scale. We further investigate the convergence rate of the QCP under the proposed policy. The FCP, due to the incorporation of unpunctuality, is difficult to solve analytically. We thus propose a time-discretized numerical scheme to approximately solve the FCP. The discretized FCP takes the form of a quadratic program with linear constraints. We examine the behavior of these schedules under different unpunctuality assumptions and test the performance of the schedules on real data in a simulation study. Interestingly, the optimal schedules can involve block booking of patients, even if the unpunctuality distributions are continuous.</description>
