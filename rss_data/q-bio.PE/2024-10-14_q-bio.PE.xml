      <title>The impact of quiescence egg on the efficacy of Wolbachia-carrying mosquito release to suppress or diminish the wild mosquito population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordinary differential model is proposed to understand the role of egg quiescence on the efficacy of releasing the Wolbachia-carrying mosquito to suppress or diminish the wild mosquito population. The model has up to four steady states, which are: the persistence of the uninfected population and the extinction of the infected one, the persistence of the infected population and the extinction of the uninfected one, the extinction of both populations, and the persistence of both populations. Their stability is given by four thresholds; two are the fitness of infected and uninfected populations when isolated, and the other two are the relative fitness when they are competing. Bifurcation diagrams, phase space, and parameter space are shaped by the sex ratio that can be manipulated by the Wolbachia symbiont. A sensitive analysis indicates that the uninfected population always maximizes its fitness according to the environmental conditions throughout, changing the quiescence rate. Because Wolbachia-infected eggs do not survive quiescence or adults emerging from it are infertile, the risk of arbovirus transmission increases during or after environmental stress that triggers quiescence. This can jeopardize the use of Wolbachia-infected mosquito to control arbovirus transmissions in regions where quiescence occurs at a high rate.</description>

      <title>Derivation of macroscopic epidemic models from multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic review of some basic results on the derivation of classical epidemiological models from simple agent-based dynamics. The evolution of large populations is coupled with the dynamics of the contact distribution, providing insights into how individual behaviors impact macroscopic epidemiological trends. The resulting set of equations incorporates local characteristics of the operator governing the emergence of a family of contact distributions. To validate the proposed approach, we provide several numerical results based on asymptotic preserving methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the multi-scale nature of the problem and ensuring robust performance across different regimes.</description>

      <title>Inferring birth versus death dynamics for ecological interactions in stochastic heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the significance of ecological interactions and separation of birth and death dynamics in heterogeneous stochastic populations. Interactions can manifest through the birth dynamics, the death dynamics, or some combination of the two. The underlying mechanisms are important but often implicit in data. We propose an inference method for disambiguating the types of interaction and the birth and death processes from time series data of a stochastic n-type heterogeneous population. The interspecies interactions considered can be competitive, antagonistic, or mutualistic. The inference method is then validated in the example of two-type Lotka-Volterra dynamics. Utilizing stochastic fluctuations enables us to estimate additional parameters in a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model, which are not identifiable in a deterministic model. We also show that different pairs of birth and death rates with the same net growth rate manifest different time series statistics and survival probabilities.</description>

      <title>Emergence of vertical diversity under disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14668v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently strong competition, vertical diversity characterized by a family of Hill numbers robustly emerges as a local maximum at intermediate disturbance.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Control of Non-Markovian Cellular Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many organisms and cell types, from bacteria to cancer cells, exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt to fluctuating environments. Additionally, cells can leverage memory of past environments to better survive previously-encountered stressors. From a control perspective, this adaptability poses significant challenges in driving cell populations toward extinction, and is thus an open question with great clinical significance. In this work, we focus on drug dosing in cell populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. For specific dynamical models switching between resistant and susceptible states, exact solutions are known. However, when the underlying system parameters are unknown, and for complex memory-based systems, obtaining the optimal solution is currently intractable. To address this challenge, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to identify informed dosing strategies to control cell populations evolving under novel non-Markovian dynamics. We find that model-free deep RL is able to recover exact solutions and control cell populations even in the presence of long-range temporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>A dissimilarity measure for semidirected networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semidirected networks have received interest in evolutionary biology as the appropriate generalization of unrooted trees to networks, in which some but not all edges are directed. Yet these networks lack proper theoretical study. We define here a general class of semidirected phylogenetic networks, with a stable set of leaves, tree nodes and hybrid nodes. We prove that for these networks, if we locally choose the direction of one edge, then globally the set of directed paths starting by this edge is stable across all choices to root the network. We define an edge-based representation of semidirected phylogenetic networks and use it to define a dissimilarity between networks, which can be efficiently computed in near-quadratic time. Our dissimilarity extends the widely-used Robinson-Foulds distance on both rooted trees and unrooted trees. After generalizing the notion of tree-child networks to semidirected networks, we prove that our edge-based dissimilarity is in fact a distance on the space of tree-child semidirected phylogenetic networks.</description>
