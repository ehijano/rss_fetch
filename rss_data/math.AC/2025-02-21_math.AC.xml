      <title>Homological properties of the module of differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes were produced by J\"urgen Herzog to accompany his lectures in Recife, Brazil, in 1980, on the homological algebra of noetherian local rings. They are are concerned with two conjectures made by Wolmer Vasconcelos: if the conormal module of a local ring has finite projective dimension, or if the module of differentials, taken over an appropriate field, has finite projective dimension, then the ring must be complete intersection. The notes present an accessible and self-contained account of the strongest results known at the time in connection with these problems; this includes a number of ideas that have not appeared elsewhere. In the last section, Herzog turns his attention to the cotangent complex, and conjectures himself that if the cotangent complex of a local ring has bounded homology groups, then the ring must be complete intersection. Among other results, he proves that the conjecture holds for local rings of characteristic zero over which all modules have rational Poincar\'e series.
  Sadly J\"urgen Herzog passed away in April of 2024. The notes in this form have been prepared in his memory, newly typeset and lightly edited. A short appendix has been added to survey some of the results of the intervening decades.</description>

      <title>Divisibility Relations Between Ring Homomorphisms and Surjective Group Homomorphisms in Finite Cyclic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we delve into the intricate relationship between the number of ring homomorphisms and surjective group homomorphisms between two finite cyclic structures, specifically $\mathbb{Z}_m$ and $\mathbb{Z}_n$. We demonstrate that the number of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a divisor of the number of surjective group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, provided that $n$ is not of the form $2 \cdot \alpha$, where each prime factor $p$ of $\alpha$ satisfies $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.</description>

      <title>Noetherianity of polynomial rings up to group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a commutative Noetherian ring, and $k[S]$ the polynomial ring with indeterminates parameterized by elements in a set $S$. We show that $k[S]$ is Noetherian up to actions of permutation groups on $S$ satisfying certain combinatorial conditions. Moreover, there is a special linear order on every infinite $S$ such that $k[S]$ is Noetherian up to the action of the order-preserving permutation group, and the existence of such a linear order is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. These Noetherian results are proved via a sheaf theoretic approach and the work of Nagel-R\"{o}mer.</description>

      <title>The $p$-adic Galois Cohomology of Valuation Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Galois cohomology of any $p$-adic valuation field extension of a pre-perfectoid field. Moreover, we obtain a generalization and also a new proof of the classical results of Tate and Hyodo on discrete valuation fields, without using higher ramification group, local class field theory or Epp's elimination of ramifications. A key ingredient is Gabber-Ramero's computation of cotangent complexes for valuation rings.</description>

      <title>Root polytopes, tropical types, and toric edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider arrangements of tropical hyperplanes where the apices of the hyperplanes are taken to infinity in certain directions. Such an arrangement defines a decomposition of Euclidean space where a cell is determined by its `type' data, analogous to the covectors of an oriented matroid. By work of Develin-Sturmfels and Fink-Rinc\'{o}n, these `tropical complexes' are dual to (regular) subdivisions of root polytopes, which in turn are in bijection with mixed subdivisions of certain generalized permutohedra. Extending previous work with Joswig-Sanyal, we show how a natural monomial labeling of these complexes describes polynomial relations (syzygies) among `type ideals' which arise naturally from the combinatorial data of the arrangement. In particular, we show that the cotype ideal is Alexander dual to a corresponding initial ideal of the lattice ideal of the underlying root polytope. This leads to novel ways of studying algebraic properties of various monomial and toric ideals, as well as relating them to combinatorial and geometric properties. In particular, our methods of studying the dimension of the tropical complex leads to new formulas for homological invariants of toric edge ideals of bipartite graphs, which have been extensively studied in the commutative algebra community.</description>

      <title>Koszulity, supersolvability, and Stirling representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and matroids are known to give rise to certain Koszul algebras, namely their Orlik-Solomon algebras and graded Varchenko-Gel'fand algebras. We explore how this interacts with group actions, particularly for the braid arrangement and the action of the symmetric group, where the Hilbert functions of the algebras and their Koszul duals are given by Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds, respectively. The corresponding symmetric group representations exhibit branching rules that interpret Stirling number recurrences, which are shown to apply to all supersolvable arrangements. They also enjoy representation stability properties that follow from Koszul duality.</description>
