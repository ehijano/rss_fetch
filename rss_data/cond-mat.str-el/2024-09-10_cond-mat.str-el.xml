      <title>Negative dynamic conductivity of the photoinduced $\eta$ pairing state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity, $\sigma(\omega; t)$, above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega &gt; \Delta_{\rm c}$, after an electromagnetic pump pulse in the half-filled Hubbard chain. The negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega; t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from phases dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. The negative conductivity and its dynamic oscillations, observed in the absence of continuous driving, are indicative of a nonequilibrium excitation, akin to the Higgs mode observed in s- and d-wave superconductors. We use the time-dependent tensor-network algorithm in the infinite matrix-product-state representation, providing a detailed characterization of the optical response in this nonequilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Large-$N$ SU(4) Schwinger boson theory for coupled-dimer antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04627v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic large-$N$ expansion based on the Schwinger boson representation of SU(4) coherent states of dimers for the paradigmatic spin-$1/2$ bilayer square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This system exhibits a quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic state and a N\'eel order state, driven by the coupling constant $g = J'/J$, which is defined as the ratio between the inter-dimer $J'$ and intra-dimer $J$ exchange interactions. We demonstrate that this approach accurately describes static and dynamic properties on both sides of the quantum phase transition. The critical coupling constant $g_c \approx 0.42$ and the dynamic spin structure factor reproduce quantum Monte Carlo results with high precision. Notably, the $1/N$ corrections reveal the longitudinal mode of the magnetically ordered phase along with the overdamping caused by its decay into the two-magnon continuum. The present large-$N$ $SU(N)$ Schwinger boson theory can be extended to more general cases of quantum paramagnets that undergo a quantum phase transition into magnetically ordered states.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Nonlinear Hall Effect in Three-dimesional Mangetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) has been detected in various of condensed matter systems. Unlike linear Hall effect, NLHE may exist in physical systems with broken inversion symmetry in the crystal. On the other hand, real space spin texture may also break inversion symmetry and result in NLHE. In this letter, we employ the Feynman diagramatic technique to calculate nonlinear Hall conductivity (NLHC) in three-dimensional magnetic systems. The results connect NLHE with the physical quantity of emergent electrodynamics which oringates from the magnetic texture. The leading order contribution of NLHC $\chi_{abb}$ is proportional to the emergent toroidal moment $\mathcal{T}_{a}^{e}$ which reflects how the spin textures wind in three dimension.</description>

      <title>Floquet dynamical chiral spin liquid at finite frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Chern Insulators. Their realizations on ultracold-atom or Rydberg-atom platforms remain very challenging. Recently, a setup of time-periodic modulations of nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings applied on an initial genuine spin liquid state on the square lattice has been proposed to stabilize a (Abelian) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ CSL phase. In the high-frequency limit, it was shown that time evolution can be described in terms of a static effective chiral Hamiltonian. Here we revisit this proposal and consider drives at lower frequency in a regime where the high-frequency Magnus expansion fails. We show that a Dynamical CSL (DCSL) is nevertheless stabilized in a finite range of frequency. The topological nature of this dynamical phase, as well as its instability below a critical frequency, is connected to specific features of the Floquet pseudo-energy spectrum. We also show that the DCSL can be represented faithfully by a two-dimensional time-periodic tensor network and, as in the static case, topological order is associated to a tensor gauge symmetry ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ in that case).</description>

      <title>Edge-driven transition between extended quantum anomalous Hall crystal and fractional Chern insulator in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with fractionally quantized Hall conductance at fractional fillings and an extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) crystal with an integer quantized Hall conductance over an extended region of doping were recently observed in pentalayer graphene. One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent magneto-orbital order and magneto-orbitons in monolayer VCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals monolayers featuring magnetic states provide a fundamental building block for artificial quantum matter. Here, we establish the emergence of a multicomponent ground state featuring magneto-orbital excitations of the 3d2-transition metal trihalide VCl3 monolayer. We show that monolayer VCl3 realizes a ground state with simultaneous magnetic and orbital ordering using density functional theory. Using first-principles methods we derive an effective Hamiltonian with intertwined spin and orbital degree of freedom, which we demonstrate can be tuned by strain. We show that magneto-orbitons appear as the collective modes of this complex order, and arise from coupled orbiton magnon excitations due to the magneto-orbital coupling in the system. Our results establish VCl3 as a promising 2D material to observe emergent magneto-orbital excitations and provide a platform for multicomponent symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Testing the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis with high-order cyclotron resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies of carrier-carrier scattering in degenerate two-dimensional systems have revealed radically different relaxation times for odd and even angular harmonics of distribution function. This theoretical concept, dubbed as 'tomographic Fermi liquid', is yet challenging to test with dc electrical measurements as electron scattering weakly affects the electrical resistivity. Here, we show that linewidth and amplitude of electromagnetic absorption at the multiple harmonics of the cyclotron resonance carries all necessary information to test the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis. Namely, the height and inverse width of $m$-th order cyclotron resonance ($m \ge 2$) is proportional to the lifetime of $m$-th angular harmonic of electron distribution function $\tau_m$, if probed at wavelengths exceeding the cyclotron radius $R_c$. Measurements of high-order cyclotron resonance at short wavelengths order of $R_c$ also enable a direct determination of all lifetimes $\tau_m$ from a simple linear system of equations that we hereby derive. Extraction of cyclotron resonance lifetimes from an experiment on terahertz photoconductivity in graphene shows that third-order resonance is systematically narrower than second-order one, supporting the prediction of tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of the ferromagnetic quantum critical system YbNi$_4$(P$_{1-x}$As$_{x}$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on single crystal growth and physical properties of the quantum critical Kondo-lattice system YbNi$_4$(P$_{1-x}$As$_{x}$)$_2$ with $0\leq x\leq 1$ which hosts a ferromagnetic quantum critical point at $x \approx 0.1$. We performed measurements of the magnetization, electrical resistivity, thermopower, heat capacity, and resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy. Arsenic substitution leads to a homogeneous increase of the unit-cell volume, with well-defined As-concentrations in large parts of the single crystals. All data consistently show that with increasing $x$ the Kondo temperature increases, while the magnetic anisotropy observed at low $x$ fully vanishes towards $x=1$. Consequently, at low temperatures, the system shows a crossover from pronounced non-Fermi liquid behaviour for $x \leq 0.2$ to a Fermi liquid behavior for $x &gt; 0.2$ with weak correlations. There is a continuous change in Yb valence from nearly trivalent at low $x$ to a slightly lower value for $x = 0.6$, which correlates with the Kondo temperature. Interestingly, specific heat measurements at very low temperatures show that $C/T$ strongly increases towards lower $T$ for $x = 0.13$ and $x = 0.2$ with a very similar power law. This suggests that in YbNi$_4$(P$_{1-x}$As$_{x}$)$_2$ a quantum critical region rather than a quantum critical point might exist.</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor network algorithm for thermal quantum many-body systems in two dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures is a significant challenge in computational physics. In this work, we present a scalable finite-temperature tensor network algorithm for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. We employ the (fermionic) projected entangled pair state (PEPS) to represent the vectorization of the quantum thermal state and utilize a stochastic reconfiguration method to cool down the quantum states from infinite temperature. We validate our method by benchmarking it against the 2D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, and the Fermi-Hubbard model, comparing physical properties such as internal energy, specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility with results obtained from stochastic series expansion (SSE), exact diagonalization, and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC).</description>

      <title>Dynamics in the nonequilibrium energy landscape of a frustrated Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Mott insulator, a laser pulse with frequency tuned to the gap scale can create a holon-doublon plasma, suppressing the magnetic moment ${\vec m}_i$ and destroying magnetic order. While this disruptive effect is well established experimentally on a square lattice, we investigate the effect of laser pumping on the triangular lattice, where geometric frustration leads to a richer set of ordering possibilities. We work with the Mott-Hubbard problem at a coupling where $120^{\circ}$ order is just stable and employ spatio-temporal mean field dynamics to study the pump response. Moderate pump amplitude just leads to the reduction of $120^{\circ}$ order, but at larger amplitude the suppression of $120^{\circ}$ order is followed by the appearance of `spiral order'. On the electronic side the density of `excited carriers' $n_{exc}$ in the upper Hubbard band increases monotonically with pump amplitude. We show that the long time ordering possibilities in the pumped system, e.g., the emergence of spiral order, can be inferred from a nonequilibrium `energy landscape'. We analyse the growth of spiral order by using an exact diagonalisation based Langevin equation on large lattices and discover that the new order can take $\sim 10^3-10^4$ times the electronic timescale to appear. The threefold combination, of mean field dynamics, landscape construction, and Langevin dynamics, readily generalises to the search for pump induced `hidden order' in other gapped systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic evidence of fermionic behavior in the vicinity of one-ninth plateau in a kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnets are believed to host exotic quantum entangled states. Recently, the report of 1/9 magnetization plateau and magnetic oscillations in a kagome antiferromagnet YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$] (YCOB) have made this material a promising candidate for experimentally realizing quantum spin liquid states. Here we present measurements of the specific heat $C_p$ in YCOB in high magnetic fields (up to 41.5 Tesla) down to 0.46 Kelvin, and the 1/9 plateau feature has been confirmed. Moreover, the temperature dependence of $C_p/T$ in the vicinity of 1/9 plateau region can be fitted by a linear in $T$ term which indicates the presence of a Dirac spectrum, together with a constant term, which indicates a finite density of states (DOS) contributed by other Fermi surfaces. Surprisingly the constant term is highly anisotropic in the direction of the magnetic field. Additionally, we observe a double-peak feature near $30$~T above the 1/9 plateau which is another hallmark of fermionic excitations in the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Large Oscillatory Thermal Hall Effect in Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Hall effect recently provided intriguing probes to the ground state of exotic quantum matters. These observations of transverse thermal Hall signals lead to the debate on the fermionic versus bosonic origins of these phenomena. The recent report of quantum oscillations (QOs) in Kitaev spin liquid points to a possible resolution. The Landau level quantization would most likely capture only the fermionic thermal transport effect. However, the QOs in the thermal Hall effect are generally hard to detect. In this work, we report the observation of a large oscillatory thermal Hall effect of correlated Kagome metals. We detect a 180-degree phase change of the oscillation and demonstrate the phase flip as an essential feature for QOs in the thermal transport properties. More importantly, the QOs in the thermal Hall channel are more profound than those in the electrical Hall channel, which strongly violates the Wiedemann Franz (WF) law for QOs. This result presents the oscillatory thermal Hall effect as a powerful probe to the correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Oscillations Evidence for Topological Bands in Kagome Metal ScV6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals with kagome lattice provide bulk materials to host both the flat-band and Dirac electronic dispersions. A new family of kagome metals is recently discovered in AV6Sn6. The Dirac electronic structures of this material need more experimental evidence to confirm. In the manuscript, we investigate this problem by resolving the quantum oscillations in both electrical transport and magnetization in ScV6Sn6. The revealed orbits are consistent with the electronic band structure models. Furthermore, the Berry phase of a dominating orbit is revealed to be around $\pi$, providing direct evidence for the topological band structure, which is consistent with calculations. Our results demonstrate a rich physics and shed light on the correlated topological ground state of this kagome metal.</description>

      <title>Charge correlation, doublon-holon binding and screening in the doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic correlations arise from the competition between the electrons' kinetic and Coulomb interaction energy and give rise to a rich phase diagram and many emergent quasiparticles. The binding of doubly-occupied and empty sites into a doublon-holon exciton is an example of this in the Hubbard model. Unlike traditional excitons in semiconductors, in the Hubbard model it is the kinetic energy which provides the binding energy. Upon doping, we find the emergence of exciton complexes, such as a holon-doublon-holon trion. The appearance of these low-lying collective excitations make screening more effective in the doped system. As a result, Hubbard-based modelling of correlated materials should use different values of $U$ for the doped system and the insulating parent compound, which we illustrate using the cuprates as an example.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Quantum Critical Endpoint in the Kitaev Candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The putative Kitaev material Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has recently been proposed to enter a quantum spin disordered state when magnetic fields are applied in parallel to the honeycomb layers. In this report we uncover signatures of a quantum critical endpoint (QCEP) associated with the assumed order-disorder transition by means of high-resolution capacitance dilatometry. At the critical field $B_\mathrm{C} \simeq 6$~T , a sign change of the out-of-plane thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha_c$ indicates accumulation of entropy upon crossing the phase boundary. The proportional relationship between isothermal magnetisation and magnetostriction signals that the QCEP can be tuned by magnetic field and pressure simultaneously. The presented results expand the material classes that exhibit metamagnetic quantum criticality to honeycomb antiferromagnets with possible Kitaev interactions.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Anyon Condenstion in 2+1d topological orders: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for realizing anyon condensation of topological orders within the string-net model by constructing a Hamiltonian that bridges the parent string-net model before and the child string-net model after anyon condensation. Our approach classifies all possible types of bosonic anyon condensation in any parent string-net model and identifies the basic degrees of freedom in the corresponding child models. Compared with the traditional UMTC perspective of topological orders, our method offers a finer categorical description of anyon condensation at the microscopic level. We also explicitly represent relevant UMTC categorical entities characterizing anyon condensation through our model-based physical quantities, providing practical algorithms for calculating these categorical data.</description>

      <title>Charge ordering and spontaneous topological Hall effect in bilayer skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion crystals with zero net skyrmion charge and zero topological Hall response are interesting candidate phases which can occur at a vanishing magnetic field in centrosymmetric systems. We study a minimal bilayer model of skyrmion crystals having opposite chirality and topological charge in the two layers, and show that it can host nearly flat electronic bands with quasi-uniform Berry curvature and quantum metric. Using Hartree-Fock theory, we show that weak to moderate short-range electron interactions induce two distinct types of symmetry breaking patterns depending on the band dispersion: an intra-unit-cell charge density modulation from Chern band mixing or a layer-imbalanced phase with a nonzero ferroelectric polarization. Both phases break inversion symmetry leading to a spontaneous and large net topological Hall effect, with the phase diagram tunable by external electric fields. Our results may be relevant to centrosymmetric skyrmion materials such as Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ as well as artificially engineered heterostructures. We also discuss its relation to recent work on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Fractons on curved spacetime in $2+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dipole Chern-Simons theory with and without a cosmological constant in $2+1$ dimensions. We write the theory in a second order formulation and show that this leads to a fracton gauge theory coupled to Aristotelian geometry which can also be coupled to matter. This coupling exhibits the remarkable property of generalizing dipole gauge invariance to curved spacetimes, without placing any limitations on the possible geometries. We also use the second order formulation to construct a higher dimensional generalization of the action. Finally, for the $(2+1)$-dimensional Chern-Simons theory we find solutions and interpret these as electric monopoles, analyze their charges and argue that the asymptotic symmetries are infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Nonlinear Transport in a Floquet-Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic laser driving, known as Floquet engineering, is a powerful tool to manipulate the properties of quantum materials. Using circularly polarized light, artificial magnetic fields, called Berry curvature, can be created in the photon-dressed Floquet-Bloch states that form. This mechanism, when applied to 3D Dirac and Weyl systems, is predicted to lead to photon-dressed movement of Weyl nodes which should be detectable in the transport sector. The transport response of such a topological light-matter hybrid, however, remains experimentally unknown. Here, we report on the transport properties of the type-II Weyl semimetal T$\mathrm{_d}$-MoTe$_\mathrm{2}$ illuminated by a femtosecond pulse of circularly polarized light. Using an ultrafast optoelectronic device architecture, we observed injection currents and a helicity-dependent anomalous Hall effect whose scaling with laser field strongly deviate from the perturbative laws of nonlinear optics. We show using Floquet theory that this discovery corresponds to the formation of a magnetic Floquet-Weyl semimetal state. Numerical ab initio simulations support this interpretation, indicating that the light-induced motion of the Weyl nodes contributes substantially to the measured transport signals. This work demonstrates the ability to generate large effective magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 30T) with light, which can be used to manipulate the magnetic and topological properties of a range of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Superconductivity in Twisted MoTe2 Nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity in topological materials can lead to innovative electronic phases and device functionalities. Here, we present a new strategy for quantum engineering of superconducting junctions in moire materials through direct, on-chip, and fully encapsulated 2D crystal growth. We achieve robust and designable superconductivity in Pd-metalized twisted bilayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) and observe anomalous superconducting effects in high-quality junctions across ~ 20 moire cells. Surprisingly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd7MoTe2 superconductor. Additionally, the critical current further exhibits a striking V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and indeed absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe2 created using the same approach. We discuss implications of these observations, including the possible formation of mixed even- and odd-parity superconductivity at the moire junctions. Our results also demonstrate a pathway to engineer and investigate superconductivity in fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Search and Prediction of Layered 4f-Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of multifunctional devices calls for the discovery of new layered materials with novel electronic properties. f-electron systems naturally host a rich set of competing and intertwining phases owning to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, electron-electron interactions, and hybridization between itinerant and local electrons. However, very little attention has been devoted to exploring the f-electron family of compounds for new promising layered material candidates. Here, we identify 295 rare earth compounds from across the lanthanide series of elements that exhibit a spectrum of lattice symmetries and electronic properties. In particular, we find metallic compounds and insulating systems with band gaps covering a 0.1 eV to 5.3 eV range which opens new possibilities in infrared quantum sensors, designer photocatalysts, and tunable transistors. The inclusion of 4f-states in a layered system also suggests the possibility of 2D confined heavy-fermion superconductivity and topological semimetals. Our study serves as a springboard to further systematic theoretical investigation of correlation-driven properties of the 4f and other 2D materials composed of heavy elements.</description>

      <title>FePd2Te2: An Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Ferromagnet with One-Dimensional Fe Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets have attracted significant attentions in recent years due to their importance in the research on both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. Here, we report the discovery of a new ternary compound FePd2Te2. It features a layered quasi-2D crystal structure with one-dimensional Fe zigzag chains extending along the b-axis in the cleavage plane. Single crystals of FePd2Te2 with centimeter-size could be grown. Density functional theory calculations, mechanical exfoliation and atomic force microscopy on these crystals reveal that they are 2D materialsthat can be thinned down to 5 nm. Magnetic characterization shows that FePd2Te2 is an easy-plane ferromagnet with Tc 183 K and strong in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect demonstrate that ferromagnetism could maintain in FePd2Te2 flakes with large coercivity. A crystal twinning effect is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy which makes the Fe chains right-angle bent in the cleavage plane and creates an intriguing spin texture. Our results show that FePd2Te2 is a correlated anisotropic 2D magnets that may attract multidisciplinary research interests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Coulomb blockade oscillations in transport and thermodynamic properties of a mesoscopic device having multiple charging energy modes. This setup can be realized using a nanoelectronic circuit comprising coupled hybrid metal-semiconductor islands. We show that this device can have various distinctive operational regimes depending on the strength of charging modes and base temperature. We focus on three different regimes; quantum regime, thermal regime and quantum-thermal mixed regime, in which the shape of the Coulomb blockade oscillations manifests well-defined features that can be accessed via conductance measurements. Our theory covers full crossover among these regimes, and also accounts for an accidental vanishing of one of the charging modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05842v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are some of the topological phases of matter most intensely-studied experimentally. The Weyl semimetal phase, in particular, has garned tremendous, sustained interest given fascinating signatures such as the Fermi arc surface states and the chiral anomaly, as well as the minimal requirements to protect this three-dimensional topological phase. Here, we show that thin films of Weyl semimetals (which we call quasi-(3-1)-dimensional, or q(3-1)d) generically realize finite-size topological phases distinct from 3d and 2d topological phases of established classification schemes: response signatures of the 3d bulk topology co-exist with topologically-protected, quasi-(3-2)d Fermi arc states or chiral boundary modes due to a second, previously-unidentified bulk-boundary correspondence. We show these finite-size topological semimetal phases are realized by Hamiltonians capturing the Fermiology of few-layer Van der Waals material MoTe2 in experiment. Given the broad experimental interest in few-layer Van der Waals materials and topological semimetals, our work paves the way for extensive future theoretical and experimental characterization of finite-size topological phases.</description>

      <title>An introduction to infinite projected entangled-pair state methods for variational ground state simulations using automatic differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks capture large classes of ground states of phases of quantum matter faithfully and efficiently. Their manipulation and contraction has remained a challenge over the years, however. For most of the history, ground state simulations of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems using (infinite) projected entangled pair states have relied on what is called a time-evolving block decimation. In recent years, multiple proposals for the variational optimization of the quantum state have been put forward, overcoming accuracy and convergence problems of previously known methods. The incorporation of automatic differentiation in tensor networks algorithms has ultimately enabled a new, flexible way for variational simulation of ground states and excited states. In this work we review the state-of-the-art of the variational iPEPS framework, providing a detailed introduction to automatic differentiation, a description of a general foundation into which various two-dimensional lattices can be conveniently incorporated, and demonstrative benchmarking results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the study of cobaltites have unveiled their potential as a promising platform for realizing Kitaev physics in honeycomb systems and the Ising model in weakly coupled chain materials. In this manuscript, we explore the magnetic properties of pyroxene SrCoGe$_2$O$_6$ using a combination of neutron scattering, {\it ab initio} methods, and linear spin-wave theory. Through careful examination of inelastic neutron scattering powder spectra, we propose a modified Kitaev model to accurately describe the twisted chains of edge-sharing octahedra surrounding Co$^{2+}$ ions. The extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model, including a significant anisotropic bond-dependent exchange term with $K/|J|=0.96$, is identified as the key descriptor of the magnetic interactions in SrCoGe$_2$O$_6$. Furthermore, our heat capacity measurements reveal an effect of an external magnetic field (approximately 13~T) which shifts the system from a fragile antiferromagnetic ordering with $T_{\mathrm{N}}=9$~K to a field-induced state. We argue that pyroxenes, particularly those modified by substituting Ge with Si and its less extended $p$ orbitals, emerge as a novel platform for the Kitaev model. This opens up possibilities for advancing our understanding of Kitaev physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in $d$-dimensional spin systems exhibiting $SO(3)$ spin rotation and lattice translation symmetries in the presence of $k-$local interactions decaying as $\sim 1/r^\alpha$ with distance $r$. Two types of Hamiltonians are considered: Type I comprises long-range spin-spin couplings, while Type II features long-range couplings between $SO(3)$ symmetric local operators. For spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems, it is shown that Type I cannot have a unique symmetric ground state with a nonzero excitation gap when the interaction decays sufficiently fast, \ie when $\alpha&gt;\max(3d,4d-2)$. For Type II, the condition becomes $\alpha&gt;\max(3d-1,4d-3)$. In $1d$, this ingappability condition is improved to $\alpha&gt;2$ for Type I and $\alpha&gt;0$ for Type II by examining the energy of a state with a uniform $2\pi$ twist. Notably, in $2d$, a Type II Hamiltonian with van der Waals interaction is subject to the constraint of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Unusual low-temperature behavior in the half-filled band of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a kind of finite-temperature pseudo-transition was observed in several quasi-one-dimensional models. In this work, we consider a genuine one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit, influenced by an external magnetic field and with the arbitrary number of particles controlled by the chemical potential. The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit was initially studied in the seventies and has been investigated over the past decades, but it still surprises us today with its fascinating properties. We rigorously analyze its low-temperature behavior using the transfer matrix technique and provide accurate numerical results. Our analysis confirms that there is an anomalous behavior in the half-filled band, specifically occurring between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. Previous investigations did not deeply identify this anomalous behavior, maybe due to the numerical simplicity of the model, but from analytical point of view this is not so easy to manipulate algebraically because one needs to solve an algebraic cubic equation. In this study, we explore this behavior and clearly distinguish the pseudo-transition, which could easily be mistaken with a real phase transition. This anomalous behavior mimics features of both first- and second-order phase transitions. However, due to its nature, we cannot expect a finite-temperature phase transition in this model.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of nonlocal Coulomb interactions in perovskite transition metal oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the density functional theory incorporating on-site and inter-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U+V), we have investigated the role of the nonlocal interactions on the electronic structures of the transition metal oxide perovskites. Using constrained random phase approximation calculations, we derived screened Coulomb interaction parameters and revealed a competition between localization and screening effects, which results in nonmonotonic behavior with d-orbital occupation. We highlight the significant role and nonlocality of inter-site Coulomb interactions, V, comparable in magnitude to the local interaction, U. Our DFT+U+V results exemplarily show the representative band renormalization, and deviations from ideal extended Hubbard models due to increased hybridization between transition metal d and oxygen p orbitals as occupation increases. We further demonstrate that the inclusion of the inter-site V is essential for accurately reproducing the experimental magnetic order in transition metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Fermi Machine -- Quantum Many-Body Solver Derived from Correspondence between Noninteracting and Strongly Correlated Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated by the successful descriptions of strongly correlated electron systems by fractionalized fermions, correspondence between interacting fermions and non-interacting multi-component fermions is formulated in examples of the Hubbard model. The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for a quantum many-body solver represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After showing the exact correspondence of 1- and 2-site Hubbard model to two-component noninteracting fermions, numerical algorithm of the quantum machine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site systems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Extended quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e structures: phase transitions and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer rhombohedral graphene have unearthed a number of interesting phenomena in the regime where Integer and Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall phenomena were previously reported. Specifically at low temperature ($T$) and low applied currents, an "Extended" Integer Quantum Anomalous Hall (EIQAH) is seen over a wide range of the phase diagram. As the current is increased, at low $T$, the EIQAH undergoes a phase transition to a metallic state at generic fillings, and to the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) state at the Jain fillings. Increasing temperature at the Jain fillings also leads to an evolution out of the EIQAH to the Jain state. Here we provide an interpretation of many of these observations. We describe the EIQAH as a crystalline state (either of holes doped into the $\nu = 1$ state, or an Anomalous Hall Crystal of electrons) that breaks moir\'e translation symmetry. At generic fillings, we show how an electric current-induced depinning transition of the crystalline order leads to peculiar non-linear current-voltage curves consistent with the experiment. At Jain fillings, we propose that the depinning transition is pre-empted by an equilibrium transition between EIQAH and Jain FQAH states. This transition occurs due to the large polarizability of the Jain FQAH states which enables them to lower their energy effectively in an applied electric field compared to the crystal states. We also discuss the finite temperature evolution in terms of the relative entropies of the crystalline and FQAH states.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and long-range magnetic ordering in NiO tuned by pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory method we revisit the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the prototypical correlated insulator NiO. We study the pressure-induced evolution of the electronic structure, magnetic state, and exchange couplings of the antiferromagnetic phase of NiO. We calculate the ordered magnetic moments and uniform spin susceptibility of the Ni $3d$ states of NiO, which allow us to determine the pressure-dependence of the N\'eel temperature $T_N$. We note that the long-range magnetism has no significant effects on the valence band photoemission spectra of NiO under moderate compressions, implying the importance of correlations effects to explain the insulating state of NiO. The antiferromagnetic insulating state is found to be stable up to the high compression value $\sim$0.4 $V_0$ (assuming the cubic $B1$ crystal structure of NiO), and is associated with a (correlated-assisted) Slater insulating state driven by the long-range magnetic ordering. In fact, the paramagnetic phase of NiO at such high compression is found to be metallic, implying delocalization of the Ni $3d$ states. The calculated $T_N$ exhibits a non-monotonic behavior upon compression, with a maximum associated with the crossover from Mott localized (strong coupling) to itinerant moment regimes, in qualitative agreement with the phase diagram of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. We point out the importance of the non-local correlation effects to explain the magnetic properties of NiO.</description>

      <title>Connection between f-electron correlations and magnetic excitations in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detailed anisotropy of the low-temperature, low-energy magnetic excitations of the candidate spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ is revealed using inelastic neutron scattering. The magnetic excitations emerge from the Brillouin zone boundary at the high symmetry $Y$ and $T$ points and disperse along the crystallographic $\hat{b}$-axis. In applied magnetic fields to at least $\mu_0 H=11$~T along the $\hat{c}-$axis, the magnetism is found to be field-independent in the $(hk0)$ plane. The scattering intensity is consistent with that expected from U$^{3+}$/U$^{4+}$ $f$-electron spins with preferential orientation along the crystallographic $\hat{a}$-axis, and a fluctuating magnetic moment of 2.3(7) $\mu_B$. These characteristics indicate that the excitations are due to intraband spin excitons arising from $f$-electron hybridization.</description>

      <title>Capturing spin fluctuations in CaCuO$_2$: $\textit{Ab initio}$ QMC calculations with multi-determinant wave functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an advanced $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculation of the ground state of undoped CaCuO$_2$. We extend the traditional single-determinant Slater-Jastrow approach to include multi-determinant wave functions, inhomogeneous Jastrow factors, and orbital optimization. Our results demonstrate not only an improvement in the variational bound of the ground state energy -- 2.3 eV per formula unit lower than previous state of the art techniques -- but also confirm the presence of spin fluctuations in multi-determinant wave functions in a strongly correlated cuprate system, which is integral to understanding high-$T_c$ superconductivity. This is the first demonstration of capturing spin fluctuations in QMC wave functions on a cuprate, establishing the groundwork for new studies on doped cuprates in the superconducting state, where spin fluctuations require more accurate characterization.</description>

      <title>Crystal-field magnetostriction of the spin ice under ultrahigh magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetoelastic properties of the Ising pyrochlore oxide Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, known as spin ice, by means of high-field magnetostriction measurements and numerical calculations. When a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic &lt;111&gt; axis, the longitudinal magnetostriction exhibits a broad maximum in the low-field regime around 30 T, followed by a dramatic lattice contraction due to crystal-field (CF) level crossing at $B_{\rm cf} \sim 65$ T. The transverse magnetostriction exhibits a contrasting behavior, highlighting the anisotropic nature of the CF striction. We identify distinct timescales of spin dynamics and CF-phonon dynamics by applying a magnetic field with different field-sweep rates. Our mean-field calculations, based on a point-charge model, successfully reproduce the overall magnetostriction behavior, revealing the competition between the exchange striction and CF striction. A signature of the CF level crossing is also observed through adiabatic magnetocaloric-effect measurements, consistent with our magnetostriction data.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation from electrons moving in topological spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a striking phenomenon, which reflects the ultrafast dynamics of electrons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HHG can be used to reconstruct not only the energy band structure but also the geometric structure characterized by the Berry curvature. Here, we numerically investigate HHG arising from electrons coupled with a topological spin texture in a spin scalar chiral state where time reversal symmetry is broken. In this system, a sign change in scalar chirality alters the sign of the Berry curvature while keeping the energy band structure unchanged, allowing us to discuss purely geometrical effects on HHG. Notably, we found that, when the optical frequency is significantly lower than the energy gap, the sign of scalar chirality largely affects the longitudinal response parallel to the optical field rather than the transverse response. Our analysis suggests that this can be attributed to interband currents induced by the recombination of electron-hole pairs whose real-space trajectories are modulated by the anomalous velocity term.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the kinetically constrained quantum East-West model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry Resolution of Entanglement in CFT for Twisted and Anyonic sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy (EE) in $(1+1)$-d rational conformal field theories (RCFT) with categorical non-invertible symmetries is presented. This amounts to symmetry resolving the entanglement with respect to the generalized twisted and anyonic charge sectors of the theory. The anyonic sectors label the irreducible representations of a modular fusion category defining the symmetry and can be understood through the $(2+1)$-d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) that encodes the symmetry features of the CFT. Using this, we define the corresponding generalized boundary dependent charged moments necessary for the symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy, which is the main result of this work. Furthermore, contrary to the case of invertible symmetries, we observe the breakdown of entanglement equipartition between different charged sectors at the next-to-leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff.</description>
