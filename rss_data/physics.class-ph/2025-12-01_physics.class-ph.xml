      <title>Exact four-vector work distribution and covariant Jarzynski's equality for a relativistic particle in an expanding piston</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium four-vector work in an expanding relativistic piston. By deriving the exact work distribution in this pedagogical model, we verify the covariant form of Jarzynski's equality. We find that the joint distribution of four-vector work $(W^0, W^1)$ concentrates on the origin and some curves in the $(W^0, W^1)$ space, rather than being smoothly distributed. In the non-relativistic limit, our model consistently recovers the non-relativistic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the momentum component of four-vector work remains significant in both the Lorentz-relativistic and Galilean-relativistic frameworks. In addition, we introduce a novel geometrical technique for analyzing the dynamics of relativistic collision processes, which can be straightforwardly extended to three-dimensional piston models.</description>

      <title>Exceptional deficiency of non-Hermitian systems: high-dimensional coalescence and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the coalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their complex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the concept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete coalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions and the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>
