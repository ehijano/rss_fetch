      <title>Exploring the Potential of Hybrid Machine-Learning/Physics-Based Modeling for Atmospheric/Oceanic Prediction Beyond the Medium Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of a hybrid modeling approach that combines machine learning (ML) with conventional physics-based modeling for weather prediction beyond the medium range. It extends the work of Arcomano et al. (2022), which tested the approach for short- and medium-range weather prediction, and the work of Arcomano et al. (2023), which investigated its potential for climate modeling. The hybrid model used for the forecast experiments of the paper is based on the low-resolution, simplified parameterization atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) SPEEDY. In addition to the hybridized prognostic variables of SPEEDY, the current version of the model has three purely ML-based prognostic variables. One of these is 6~h cumulative precipitation, another is the sea surface temperature, while the third is the heat content of the top 300 m deep layer of the ocean. The model has skill in predicting the El Ni\~no cycle and its global teleconnections with precipitation for 3-7 months depending on the season. The model captures equatorial variability of the precipitation associated with Kelvin and Rossby waves and MJO. Predictions of the precipitation in the equatorial region have skill for 15 days in the East Pacific and 11.5 days in the West Pacific. Though the model has low spatial resolution, for these tasks it has prediction skill comparable to what has been published for high-resolution, purely physics-based, conventional operational forecast models.</description>

      <title>Periodic forces combined with feedback induce quenching in a bistable oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of an abnormal rhythm and a normal steady state is often observed in nature (e.g., epilepsy). Such a system is modeled as a bistable oscillator that possesses both a limit cycle and a fixed point. Although bistable oscillators under several perturbations have been addressed in the literature, the mechanism of oscillation quenching, a transition from a limit cycle to a fixed point, has not been fully understood. In this study, we analyze quenching using the extended Stuart-Landau oscillator driven by periodic forces. Numerical simulations suggest that the entrainment to the periodic force induces the amplitude change of a limit cycle. By reducing the system with an averaging method, we investigate the bifurcation structures of the periodically-driven oscillator. We find that oscillation quenching occurs by the homoclinic bifurcation when we use a periodic force combined with quadratic feedback. In conclusion, we develop a state-transition method in a bistable oscillator using periodic forces, which would have the potential for practical applications in controlling and annihilating abnormal oscillations. Moreover, we clarify the rich and diverse bifurcation structures behind periodically-driven bistable oscillators, which we believe would contribute to further understanding the complex behaviors in non-autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a real 3D stationary flow characterized by chaotic advection generated by a magnetic field created by permanent magnets acting on a weakly conductive fluid subjected to a weak constant current. The model under consideration involves the Stokes equations for viscous incompressible fluid at low Reynolds number in which the density forces correspond to the Lorentz force generated by the magnetic field of the magnets and the electric current through the fluid. An innovative numerical approach based on a mixed finite element method has been developed and implemented for computing the flow velocity fields with the electromagnetic force. This ensures highly accurate numerical results, allowing a detailed analysis of the chaotic behavior of fluid trajectories through the computations of associated Poincar\'e sections and Lyapunov exponents. Subsequently, an examination of mixing efficiency is conducted, employing computations of contamination and homogeneity rates, as well as mixing time. The obtained results underscore the relevance of the modeling and computational tools employed, as well as the design of the magnetohydrodynamic device used.</description>

      <title>Weyl's law in Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can you hear the shape of Liouville quantum gravity? We obtain a Weyl law for the eigenvalues of Liouville Brownian motion: the $n$-th eigenvalue grows linearly with $n$, with the proportionality constant given by the Liouville area of the domain and a certain deterministic constant $c_\gamma$ depending on $\gamma \in (0, 2)$. The constant $c_\gamma$, initially a complicated function of Sheffield's quantum cone, can be evaluated explicitly and is strictly greater than the equivalent Riemannian constant.
  At the heart of the proof we obtain sharp asymptotics of independent interest for the small-time behaviour of the on-diagonal heat kernel. Interestingly, we show that the scaled heat kernel displays nontrivial pointwise fluctuations. Fortunately, at the level of the heat trace these pointwise fluctuations cancel each other, which leads to the result.
  We complement these results with a number of conjectures on the spectral geometry of Liouville quantum gravity, notably suggesting a connection with quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous cold-to-hot heat transfer in a nonchaotic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that, fundamentally different from a large body of rarefied gas, when a Knudsen gas is immersed in a thermal bath, it may never reach thermal equilibrium. The root cause is nonchaoticity: as the particle-particle collisions are sparse, the particle trajectories tend to be independent of each other. Usually, this counterintuitive phenomenon is studied through kinetic theory and is not considered a thermodynamic problem. In current research, we show that if incorporated in a large-sized compound setup, such an intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics: cold-to-hot heat transfer may spontaneously take place, either cyclically (with entropy barriers) or continuously (with an energy barrier). It allows for production of useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect. As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, the refrigeration statement and the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics cannot be applied. The basic principle of maximum entropy is always adhered to.</description>

      <title>Signal-noise separation using unsupervised reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removing noise from a signal without knowing the characteristics of the noise is a challenging task. This paper introduces a signal-noise separation method based on time series prediction. We use Reservoir Computing (RC) to extract the maximum portion of "predictable information" from a given signal. Reproducing the deterministic component of the signal using RC, we estimate the noise distribution from the difference between the original signal and reconstructed one. The method is based on a machine learning approach and requires no prior knowledge of either the deterministic signal or the noise distribution. It provides a way to identify additivity/multiplicativity of noise and to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indirectly. The method works successfully for combinations of various signal and noise, including chaotic signal and highly oscillating sinusoidal signal which are corrupted by non-Gaussian additive/ multiplicative noise. The separation performances are robust and notably outstanding for signals with strong noise, even for those with negative SNR.</description>
