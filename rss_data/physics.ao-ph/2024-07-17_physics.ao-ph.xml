      <title>Hybrid physics-AI outperforms numerical weather prediction for extreme precipitation nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, critical for flood emergency and river management, has remained challenging for decades, although recent developments in deep generative modeling (DGM) suggest the possibility of improvements. River management centers, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, have been using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models for nowcasting but have struggled with missed detections even from best-in-class NWP models. While decades of prior research achieved limited improvements beyond advection and localized evolution, recent attempts have shown progress from physics-free machine learning (ML) methods and even greater improvements from physics-embedded ML approaches. Developers of DGM for nowcasting have compared their approaches with optical flow (a variant of advection) and meteorologists' judgment but not with NWP models. Further, they have not conducted independent co-evaluations with water resources and river managers. Here, we show that the state-of-the-art physics-embedded deep generative model, specifically NowcastNet, outperforms the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, the latest generation of NWP, along with advection and persistence, especially for heavy precipitation events. For grid-cell extremes over 16 mm/h, NowcastNet demonstrated a median critical success index (CSI) of 0.30, compared with a median CSI of 0.04 for HRRR. However, despite hydrologically relevant improvements in point-by-point forecasts from NowcastNet, caveats include the overestimation of spatially aggregated precipitation over longer lead times. Our co-evaluation with ML developers, hydrologists, and river managers suggests the possibility of improved flood emergency response and hydropower management.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale assessment of high-resolution reanalysis precipitation fields over Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the validation of high-resolution regional reanalyses to understand their effectiveness in reproducing precipitation patterns over Italy, a climate change hotspot characterized by coastal sea-land interaction and complex orography. Nine reanalysis products were evaluated, with the ECMWF global reanalysis ERA5 serving as a benchmark. These included both European (COSMO-REA6, CERRA) and Italy-specific (BOLAM, MERIDA, MERIDA-HRES, MOLOCH, SPHERA, VHR-REA\_IT) datasets, using different models and parametrizations. The inter-comparison involved determining the effective resolution of daily precipitation fields using wavelet techniques and assessing intense precipitation statistics through frequency distributions. In-situ observations and observational gridded datasets were used to independently validate reanalysis precipitation fields. The capability of reanalyses to depict daily precipitation patterns was assessed, highlighting a maximum radius of precipitation misplacement of about 15 km, with notably lower skills during summer. An overall overestimation of precipitation was identified in the reanalysis climatological fields over the Po Valley and the Alps, whereas multiple products showed an underestimation of precipitations across the North-West coast, the Apennines, and Southern Italy. Finally, a comparison with a time-consistent observational dataset (UniMi/ISAC-CNR) revealed a non-stable deviation from observations in the annual precipitation cumulate of the reanalysis products analyzed. This should be taken into account when interpreting precipitation trends over Italy.</description>

      <title>Navigating Munk's Abyssal Recipes: Reconciling the Paradoxes and Suggesting an Upwelling Mechanism for Bottom Water in a Flat-Bottom Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walter Munk's classical work, known as the "abyssal recipes", introduced a foundational framework for comprehending the upwelling of abyssal waters. While it has spurred numerous investigations into the complexities of deep-ocean processes from theoretical, laboratory, and field perspectives, it has also faced challenges when compared to direct observations spanning decades. Two particularly intriguing paradoxes emerge: the dichotomy of diffusivities and the conundrum of interior downwelling. This study attempts to resolve these paradoxes by examining the isopycnal displacement velocity within the dynamic framework of Munk's abyssal recipes. A relieving inference is that it seems no longer an imperative to seek a globally averaged diapycnal diffusivity of O(1) cm2/s to close the mass budget associated with the bottom-water formation rate. Through box-model experiments, a novel erosion-intrusion model is proposed to elucidate the mechanism of abyssal upwelling in flat-bottom ocean, drawing an analogy to the growth of "tree rings". Based upon this model, the average rising velocity in the abyssal North Pacific is estimated using observational data of biogeochemical tracers. The proposed model does not seek to disprove existing theories but rather acts as a complement for situations that prevailing theories may not apply, such as cases with flat-bottom topography or non-bottom-intensified diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks and Spatial Information Learning for Post-Processing Ensemble Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasts from numerical weather prediction models show systematic errors that require correction via post-processing. While there has been substantial progress in flexible neural network-based post-processing methods over the past years, most station-based approaches still treat every input data point separately which limits the capabilities for leveraging spatial structures in the forecast errors. In order to improve information sharing across locations, we propose a graph neural network architecture for ensemble post-processing, which represents the station locations as nodes on a graph and utilizes an attention mechanism to identify relevant predictive information from neighboring locations. In a case study on 2-m temperature forecasts over Europe, the graph neural network model shows substantial improvements over a highly competitive neural network-based post-processing method.</description>

      <title>Neural Compression of Atmospheric States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11666v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric states derived from reanalysis comprise a substantial portion of weather and climate simulation outputs. Many stakeholders -- such as researchers, policy makers, and insurers -- use this data to better understand the earth system and guide policy decisions. Atmospheric states have also received increased interest as machine learning approaches to weather prediction have shown promising results. A key issue for all audiences is that dense time series of these high-dimensional states comprise an enormous amount of data, precluding all but the most well resourced groups from accessing and using historical data and future projections. To address this problem, we propose a method for compressing atmospheric states using methods from the neural network literature, adapting spherical data to processing by conventional neural architectures through the use of the area-preserving HEALPix projection. We investigate two model classes for building neural compressors: the hyperprior model from the neural image compression literature and recent vector-quantised models. We show that both families of models satisfy the desiderata of small average error, a small number of high-error reconstructed pixels, faithful reproduction of extreme events such as hurricanes and heatwaves, preservation of the spectral power distribution across spatial scales. We demonstrate compression ratios in excess of 1000x, with compression and decompression at a rate of approximately one second per global atmospheric state.</description>

      <title>Global atmospheric data assimilation with multi-modal masked autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global data assimilation enables weather forecasting at all scales and provides valuable data for studying the Earth system. However, the computational demands of physics-based algorithms used in operational systems limits the volume and diversity of observations that are assimilated. Here, we present "EarthNet", a multi-modal foundation model for data assimilation that learns to predict a global gap-filled atmospheric state solely from satellite observations. EarthNet is trained as a masked autoencoder that ingests a 12 hour sequence of observations and learns to fill missing data from other sensors. We show that EarthNet performs a form of data assimilation producing a global 0.16 degree reanalysis dataset of 3D atmospheric temperature and humidity at a fraction of the time compared to operational systems. It is shown that the resulting reanalysis dataset reproduces climatology by evaluating a 1 hour forecast background state against observations. We also show that our 3D humidity predictions outperform MERRA-2 and ERA5 reanalyses by 10% to 60% between the middle troposphere and lower stratosphere (5 to 20 km altitude) and our 3D temperature and humidity are statistically equivalent to the Microwave integrated Retrieval System (MiRS) observations at nearly every level of the atmosphere. Our results indicate significant promise in using EarthNet for high-frequency data assimilation and global weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>On the importance of learning non-local dynamics for stable data-driven climate modeling: A 1D gravity wave-QBO testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques, especially neural networks (NNs), have shown promise in learning subgrid-scale parameterizations for climate models. However, a major problem with data-driven parameterizations, particularly those learned with supervised algorithms, is model instability. Current remedies are often ad-hoc and lack a theoretical foundation. Here, we combine ML theory and climate physics to address a source of instability in NN-based parameterization. We demonstrate the importance of learning spatially $\textit{non-local}$ dynamics using a 1D model of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) with gravity wave (GW) parameterization as a testbed. While common offline metrics fail to identify shortcomings in learning non-local dynamics, we show that the concept of receptive field (RF) can identify instability a-priori. We find that NN-based parameterizations that seem to accurately predict GW forcings from wind profiles ($\mathbf{R^2 \approx 0.99}$) cause unstable simulations when RF is too small to capture the non-local dynamics, while NNs of the same size but large-enough RF are stable. We examine three broad classes of architectures, namely convolutional NNs, Fourier neural operators, and fully-connected NNs; the latter two have inherently large RFs. We also demonstrate that learning non-local dynamics is crucial for the stability and accuracy of a data-driven spatiotemporal emulator of the zonal wind field. Given the ubiquity of non-local dynamics in the climate system, we expect the use of effective RF, which can be computed for any NN architecture, to be important for many applications. This work highlights the necessity of integrating ML theory with physics to design and analyze data-driven algorithms for weather and climate modeling.</description>
