      <title>Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Resource Management in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient spectrum allocation has become crucial as the surge in wireless-connected devices demands seamless support for more users and applications, a trend expected to grow with 6G. Innovations in satellite technologies such as SpaceX's Starlink have enabled non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) to work alongside terrestrial networks (TNs) and allocate spectrum based on regional demands. Existing spectrum sharing approaches in TNs use machine learning for interference minimization through power allocation and spectrum sensing, but the unique characteristics of NTNs like varying orbital dynamics and coverage patterns require more sophisticated coordination mechanisms. The proposed work uses a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) approach for efficient spectrum allocation across TN-NTN networks. DRL agents are present at each TN-NTN hierarchy that dynamically learn and allocate spectrum based on regional trends. This framework is 50x faster than the exhaustive search algorithm while achieving 95\% of optimum spectral efficiency. Moreover, it is 3.75x faster than multi-agent DRL, which is commonly used for spectrum sharing, and has a 12\% higher overall average throughput.</description>

      <title>Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems with Sparse UPAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a downlink near-field extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication system with sparse uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper focuses on the power distribution of the arrived signal near the focused point of the transmit sparse UPA. In the vicinity of the focused point, along the x-axis and z-axis directions, closed-form expressions for the power distributions are derived. Based on that, expressions for the width and length of the main lobe are obtained in closed form, both of which decrease as the antenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial constraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then, the paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can estimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results verifies the correctness of the main results of this paper. Furthermore, the numerical results reveals the improvement in the performance of XL-MIMO systems with the use of sparse UPAs.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Design for Ambient IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing demand for ultra low power and ultra low complexity devices for applications which require maintenance-free and battery-less operation. One way to serve such applications is through backscatter devices, which communicate using energy harvested from ambient sources such as radio waves transmitted by a reader. Traditional backscatter devices, such as RFID, are limited by range, interference, low connection density, and security issues. To address these problems, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started working on Ambient IoT (A-IoT). For the realization of A-IoT devices, various aspects ranging from physical layer design, to the protocol stack, to the device architecture should be standardized. In this paper, we provide an overview of the standardization efforts on the physical layer design for A-IoT devices. The various physical channels and signals are discussed, followed by link level simulations to compare the performance of various configurations of reader to device and device to reader channels.</description>

      <title>Multi-task deep-learning for sleep event detection and stage classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polysomnographic sleep analysis is the standard clinical method to accurately diagnose and treat sleep disorders. It is an intricate process which involves the manual identification, classification, and location of multiple sleep event patterns. This is complex, for which identification of different types of events involves focusing on different subsets of signals, resulting on an iterative time-consuming process entailing several visual analysis passes. In this paper we propose a multi-task deep-learning approach for the simultaneous detection of sleep events and hypnogram construction in one single pass. Taking as reference state-of-the-art methodology for object-detection in the field of Computer Vision, we reformulate the problem for the analysis of multi-variate time sequences, and more specifically for pattern detection in the sleep analysis scenario. We investigate the performance of the resulting method in identifying different assembly combinations of EEG arousals, respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) and sleep stages, also considering different input signal montage configurations. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach using two independent datasets, assessing true-generalization effects involving local and external validation scenarios. Based on our results, we analyze and discuss our method's capabilities and its potential wide-range applicability across different settings and datasets.</description>

      <title>NL-COMM: Enhanced Video Streaming via Advanced Non-Linear Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With video streaming now accounting for the majority of internet traffic, wireless networks face increasing demands, especially in densely populated areas where limited spectral resources are shared among many devices. While multi-user (MU)-MIMO technology aims to improve spectral efficiency by enabling concurrent transmissions over the same frequency and time resources, traditional linear processing methods fall short of fully utilizing available channel capacity. These methods require a substantial number of antennas and RF chains, to support a much smaller number of MIMO streams, leading to increased power consumption and operational costs, even when the supported streams are of low rate. In this demo, we present NL-COMM, an advanced non-linear MIMO processing framework, demonstrated for the first time with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipment (UEs) in a fully 3GPP-compliant environment. In addition, also for the first time, the audience will compare and assess the quality of live, over-the-air video transmission from four concurrently transmitting UE devices, alternating between current state-of-the-art MIMO detection algorithms and NL-COMM. Key gains of NL-COMM include improved stream quality, halving the number of required base station antennas without compromising stream quality compared to linear approaches, as well as achieving antenna overloading factors of 400\%.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security in FAS-aided Wireless Powered NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of communication technologies and the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks have introduced unprecedented opportunities for ultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient communication. However, the integration of advanced technologies like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) brings significant challenges, particularly in terms of energy constraints and security vulnerabilities. Traditional antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access schemes struggle to meet the increasing demands for performance and security in such environments. To address this gap, this paper investigates the impact of emerging fluid antenna systems (FAS) on the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in WPCNs. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which a transmitter, powered by a power beacon via an energy link, transmits confidential messages to legitimate FAS-aided users over information links while an external eavesdropper attempts to decode the transmitted signals. Additionally, users leverage the NOMA scheme, where the far user may also act as an internal eavesdropper. For the proposed model, we first derive the distributions of the equivalent channels at each node and subsequently obtain compact expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC), using the Gaussian quadrature methods. Our results reveal that incorporating the FAS for NOMA users, instead of the TAS, enhances the performance of the proposed secure WPCN.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Fluid Antenna Array-Mounted UAV Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) downlink networks with fluid antennas (FA), where RIS enables non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions. Moreover, the FA is equipped on the UAV offering dynamic antenna position adjustment, enhancing spatial diversity besides UAV deployment. We aim at total downlink rate maximization while ensuring minimum user rate requirement. We consider joint optimization of active UAV beamforming, passive RIS beamforming, UAV deployment and FA position adjustment. To address the complex problem, we propose beamfomring for RIS/UAV and FA-UAV deployment (BRAUD) scheme by employing alternative optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA) and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) method for the decomposed subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of RIS-FA-UAV, achieving the highest rate among existing architectures without FA/UAV/RIS deployment and without proper beamforming. Moreover, BRAUD achieves the highest rate among benchmarks of drop-rank method, heuristic optimizations and conventional zero-forcing beamforming as well as random method.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Selection and Beamforming Design for Active RIS-aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS) aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system has been considered as a promising paradigm to improve spectrum efficiency. However, massive energy-hungry radio frequency (RF) chains hinder its large-scale deployment. To address this issue, an A-RIS-aided ISAC system with antenna selection (AS) is proposed in this work, where a target is sensed while multiple communication users are served with specifically selected antennas. Specifically, a cuckoo search-based scheme is first utilized to select the antennas associated with high-gain channels. Subsequently, with the properly selected antennas, the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the system is optimized under the condition of radar probing power level, power budget for the A-RIS and transmitter. To solve the highly non-convex optimization problem, we develop an efficient algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and fractional programming (FP). Simulation results show that the proposed AS scheme and the algorithm are effective, which reduce the number of RF chains without significant performance degradation.</description>

      <title>PISCO: Self-Supervised k-Space Regularization for Improved Neural Implicit k-Space Representations of Dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit k-space representations (NIK) have shown promising results for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high temporal resolutions. Yet, reducing acquisition time, and thereby available training data, results in severe performance drops due to overfitting. To address this, we introduce a novel self-supervised k-space loss function $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{PISCO}$, applicable for regularization of NIK-based reconstructions. The proposed loss function is based on the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency (PISCO), enforcing a consistent global k-space neighborhood relationship without requiring additional data. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on static and dynamic MR reconstructions show that integrating PISCO significantly improves NIK representations. Particularly for high acceleration factors (R$\geq$54), NIK with PISCO achieves superior spatio-temporal reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of the loss assumptions and stability shows PISCO's potential as versatile self-supervised k-space loss function for further applications and architectures.

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Ambient Backscatter Communication and Non-Terrestrial Networks: A 6G Commixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) represents a compelling response to the International Mobile Telecommunications 2030 (IMT-2030) framework, enabling the delivery of advanced, seamless connectivity that supports reliable, sustainable, and resilient communication systems. Nevertheless, the integration of NTN with Terrestrial Networks (TN) necessitates considerable alterations to the existing cellular infrastructure in order to address the challenges intrinsic to NTN implementation. Additionally, Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC), which utilizes ambient Radio Frequency (RF) signals to transmit data to the intended recipient by altering and reflecting these signals, exhibits considerable potential for the effective integration of NTN and TN. Furthermore, AmBC is constrained by its limitations regarding power, interference, and other related factors. In contrast, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within wireless networks demonstrates significant potential for predictive analytics through the use of extensive datasets. AI techniques enable the real-time optimization of network parameters, mitigating interference and power limitations in AmBC. These predictive models also enhance the adaptive integration of NTN and TN, driving significant improvements in network reliability and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of how the commixture of AI, AmBC, and NTN can facilitate the integration of NTN and TN. We also provide a thorough analysis indicating a marked enhancement in EE predicated on this triadic relationship.</description>

      <title>Intra-day Solar and Power Forecast for Optimization of Intraday Market Participation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</description>

      <title>Carrier Aggregation Enabled MIMO-OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolution towards the forthcoming era of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems characterized by ubiquitous intelligence, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is in a phase of burgeoning development. However, the capabilities of communication and sensing within single frequency band fall short of meeting the escalating demands. To this end, this paper introduces a carrier aggregation (CA)-enabled multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) ISAC system fusing the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands by symbol-level fusion for ultimate communication experience and high-accuracy sensing. The challenges in sensing signal processing introduced by CA include the initial phase misalignment of the echo signals on high and low-frequency bands due to attenuation and radar cross section, and the fusion of the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands with different physical-layer parameters. To this end, the sensing signal processing is decomposed into two stages. In the first stage, the problem of initial phase misalignment of the echo signals on high and low-frequency bands is solved by the angle compensation, spatial filtering and cyclic cross-correlation operations. In the second stage, this paper realizes symbol-level fusion of the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands through sensing vector rearrangement and cyclic prefix adjustment operations, thereby obtaining high-precision sensing performance. Then, the closed-form communication mutual information (MI) and sensing Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the proposed ISAC system are derived to explore the theoretical performance bound with CA. Simulation results validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed ISAC system.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by diverse secure requirements of multi-user in UAV systems, we propose a collaborative secret and covert transmission method for multi-antenna ground users to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Specifically, based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), two ground users with distinct security requirements, named Bob and Carlo, superimpose their signals and transmit the combined signal to the UAV named Alice. An adversary Willie attempts to simultaneously eavesdrop Bob's confidential message and detect whether Carlo is transmitting or not. We derive close-form expressions of the secrecy connection probability (SCP) and the covert connection probability (CCP) to evaluate the link reliability for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. Furthermore, we bound the secrecy outage probability (SOP) from Bob to Alice and the detection error probability (DEP) of Willie to evaluate the link security for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. To characterize the theoretical benchmark of the above model, we formulate a weighted multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the average of secret and covert transmission rates subject to constraints SOP, DEP, the beamformers of Bob and Carlo, and UAV trajectory parameters. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent (SCA-BCD) methods. Our results reveal the influence of design parameters of the system on the wiretap and covert rates, analytically and numerically. In summary, our study fills the gaps in joint secret and covert transmission for multi-user multi-antenna uplink UAV communications and provides insights to construct such systems.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal algorithms for the recovery of low-dimensional models with linear rates</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering elements of a low-dimensional model from linear measurements. From signal and image processing to inverse problems in data science, this question has been at the center of many applications. Lately, with the success of models and methods relying on deep neural networks leading to non-convex formulations, traditional convex variational approaches have shown their limits. Furthermore, the multiplication of algorithms and recovery results makes identifying the best methods a complex task. In this article, we study recovery with a class of widely used algorithms without considering any underlying functional. This result leads to a class of projected gradient descent algorithms that recover a given low-dimensional with linear rates. The obtained rates decouple the impact of the quality of the measurements with respect to the model from its intrinsic complexity. As a consequence, we can directly measure the performance of this class of projected gradient descents through a restricted Lipschitz constant of the projection. By optimizing this constant, we define optimal algorithms. Our general approach provides an optimality result in the case of sparse recovery. Moreover, we uncover underlying linear rates of convergence for some ''plug and play'' imaging methods relying on deep priors by interpreting our results in this context, thus linking low-dimensional recovery and recovery with deep priors under a unified theory, validated by experiments on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Aware Distributed Learning for Gaussian Processes with Linear Multiple Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) stand as crucial tools in machine learning and signal processing, with their effectiveness hinging on kernel design and hyper-parameter optimization. This paper presents a novel GP linear multiple kernel (LMK) and a generic sparsity-aware distributed learning framework to optimize the hyper-parameters. The newly proposed grid spectral mixture product (GSMP) kernel is tailored for multi-dimensional data, effectively reducing the number of hyper-parameters while maintaining good approximation capability. We further demonstrate that the associated hyper-parameter optimization of this kernel yields sparse solutions. To exploit the inherent sparsity of the solutions, we introduce the Sparse LInear Multiple Kernel Learning (SLIM-KL) framework. The framework incorporates a quantized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme for collaborative learning among multiple agents, where the local optimization problem is solved using a distributed successive convex approximation (DSCA) algorithm. SLIM-KL effectively manages large-scale hyper-parameter optimization for the proposed kernel, simultaneously ensuring data privacy and minimizing communication costs. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for the learning framework, while experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior prediction performance and efficiency of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network With Explicitly-Optimized Rational Graph Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</description>

      <title>Multimodal-to-Text Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models Using Feature Embeddings for GNSS Interference Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems applied across various domains, including NLP, information retrieval, and recommendation systems. Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</description>
