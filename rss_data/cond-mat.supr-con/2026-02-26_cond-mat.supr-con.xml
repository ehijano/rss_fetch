      <title>Granular aluminum induced superconductivity in germanium for hole spin-based hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures, superconductivity and spin polarization are competing effects because magnetic fields break Cooper pairs. They can be combined using thin films and in-plane magnetic fields, an approach that enabled the pursuit of Majorana zero modes, Kitaev chains, and Andreev spin qubits (ASQs), but remains challenging for materials with small in-plane g-factors. Here we show that granular aluminum (grAl), composed of nanometer-scale aluminum grains embedded in an amorphous oxide matrix, can overcome this limitation. By depositing grAl on Ge/SiGe heterostructures, we induce a hard superconducting gap with BCS peaks at 305 $\mu$eV and magnetic-field resilience for both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, allowing Zeeman splitting of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states beyond 50 $\mu$eV (12 GHz). Leveraging this robustness, we reveal signatures of hole physics and demonstrate g-tensor tunability.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Topological Defects in Type-II Superconductors under Gradients of Temperature/Spin Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the motion of a domain wall and a vortex in type-II superconductors driven by inhomogeneities of temperature or spin density. The model consists of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation, whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating between values in the superconducting and normal states. Numerical and analytical calculations indicate that the domain wall moves toward the higher-temperature/spin-density region, where the order parameter is suppressed. We also derive an analytical expression for the vortex velocity. We can understand the dynamics of topological defects as processes that reduce the loss of condensation energy. We also analyze the driving force, the viscous force, the thermal force, and the force due to the spin accumulation gradient, on the basis of the momentum balance relations.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Josephson Supercurrent in a $\pi$-Junction state by Chiral Antiferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic order typically disrupts superconductivity, reducing the supercurrent. Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a $\pi$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn$_3$Ge.</description>

      <title>Prediction of several Co-based La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-like superconducting materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity has been found in Fe-, Ni-, and Cu-based compounds but has remained elusive in Co-based materials. The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has renewed interest in related layered systems. Here, we predict several Co-based analogs that may realize similar physics. Electron doping of the high-pressure bilayer cobaltate La$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$ yields LaTh$_2$Co$_2$O$_7$, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$, and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Br$_2$, which exhibit closely related crystal structures and strongly correlated electronic states. Random-phase-approximation calculations reveal $s$-wave as the leading pairing symmetry in these compounds.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Spillover of High Magnetic Field-induced SC3 Superconductivity Outside the Spin-Polarized State in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our recent study of the high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$ [Phys. Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrical design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors, because the proper placement of intended defects in the current path contribute to flux pinning, a reduction in dissipation, and an increase in achievable current density. Topology optimization is currently one of the most powerful approaches used to determine consistent structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>

      <title>Nearly twofold overestimation of the superconducting volume fraction in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of the DC diamagnetic state in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates remained an unsolved experimental problem until recent experiments in which Zhu et al.$^1$ measured the DC diamagnetic responses in zero-field cooled (ZFC) mode in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Zhu et al.$^1$ reported that the ratio of the measured ZFC magnetic moment to the Meissner magnetic moment of the sample (and this ratio was termed the superconducting volume fraction$f$) reaches 81-86%. We regard outstanding experimental results$^1$; however, our calculations based on the reported experimental datasets$^1$ using the standard procedure showed the ratio to be 51-59%. Upon our request, Zhu et al.$^1$ provided detailed explanations and the equation they used to calculate$f$. To our knowledge, the procedure$^1$ and equation$^1$ for calculating $f$ have never been mentioned or described before, including in Ref.$^1$. Here we argue that the proposed equation$^1$ and procedure$^1$ are incorrect, and that this equation$^1$ results in multiple overestimations of the superconducting volume fraction in the sample. This overestimation error affects all superconducting volume fractions $f$ in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reported to date$^{1-4}$. Therefore, we describe the error we discovered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium plasmon liquid in a Josephson junction chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium quantum systems are often described by a gas of weakly-interacting normal modes. Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting liquid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics, and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the interplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a non-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet spin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent otherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of spin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet sidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum number, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of superconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as an entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and unconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is connected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct light drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of unconventional magnets. Our results therefore unveil the potential of unconventional magnets for realizing nontrivial light-induced superconducting states.</description>
