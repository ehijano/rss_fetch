      <title>Two-Body Contact Dynamics in a Bose Gas near a Fano-Feshbach Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time buildup of short-range correlations in a nondegenerate ultracold Bose gas near a narrow Fano-Feshbach resonance. Using rapid optical control, we quench the closed-channel molecular energy to resonance on sub-microsecond timescales and track the evolution of the two-body contact through photo-dissociation losses. Repeated pulse sequences enhance sensitivity to early-time two-body losses and reveal long-lived coherence between atom pairs and molecular states. The observed dynamics are accurately reproduced by our dynamical two-channel zero-range theory, which explicitly accounts for the resonance's narrow width and finite closed-channel decay, establishing a predictive framework for correlation dynamics in quantum gases near Fano-Feshbach resonances.</description>

      <title>Weak-link to tunneling regime in a 3D atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition from weak-link transport to the tunneling Josephson regime in a three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical, tube-like trap. By varying the height of a localized barrier, we map out the smooth crossover between these regimes through measurements of the critical current and Josephson oscillations. In the weak-link regime of the Josephson junction, dissipative transport is mediated by solitonic excitations in the form of vortex rings, which drive phase slips and generate a finite chemical potential difference across the junction. Increasing the barrier height suppresses these hydrodynamics excitations, yielding a tunneling-dominated Josephson regime characterized by phononic excitations. These findings elucidate the interplay between geometry, excitations, and dissipation in atomtronic weak links, and provide a quantitative framework for engineering coherent matter-wave circuits. Our results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations and analytical models.</description>

      <title>Merons and Meroniums in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bose Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate the existence of new types of topological states in a two-component Bose gas with Rashba spin-orbit couplings. We find four types of topological structures exist in this system. First, the half vortex (HV), which have been found and discussed in similar systems. Second, the spherical wave half vortex (SWHV), which is different from the HV by a factor of $e^{ikr}$ in the wave function. The spin configurations show that HV and SWHV are both merons. Of particular interests are the third and fourth types, which are called double peak (DP) and spin spiral (SS) phases. They are both combinations of meron and antimeron, and hence named as meroniums. These two phases demonstrate intriguing spin density patterns. Finally, the phase diagram is obtained and the stability of the meronium state is discussed.</description>

      <title>Goos-Hanchen Shift with a rotating atomic superfluid in a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Goos Hanchen shift of the transmitted probe and show that optomechanical interference in a ring Bose Einstein condensate provides a sensitive, rotation tunable beam shift response at ultralow optical powers. Without quantized circulation, conventional optomechanically induced transparency produces a strictly positive and bounded shift whose magnitude is governed primarily by cooperativity; small detuning offsets can introduce a weak, transient sign change consistent with a Fano type asymmetry, but the overall response remains limited. With circulation, the Bragg scattered mechanical side modes split, yielding a double transparency dispersion with steep dispersive flanks that strongly amplify the phase derivative and bias its sign. In this regime, the peak shift grows monotonically with control field strength, reflecting enhanced linearized coupling and increased transmission across the angular scan. At fixed power, the detuning dependence is decisive: the shift is maximized at the red sideband condition and diminishes away from resonance, tracking how effectively the scan samples the rotation split dispersive flanks. Increasing the winding number broadens the central absorption and steepens accessible phase gradients, further boosting the attainable shift. The protocol remains minimally invasive under experimentally realistic conditions, and interatomic interactions have a negligible influence on the transmission features that set the phase slope. These results identify circulation, control power, and cavity detuning as practical knobs for in situ control of the Goos Hanchen shift, enabling interferometric beam steering and phase gradient metrology in hybrid atom optomechanical platforms.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and Many-Body Backflow in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies have enabled quantum simulation of gauge theories -- some of the most fundamental frameworks of nature -- in regimes far from equilibrium, where classical computation is severely limited. These simulators, primarily based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, hold the potential to address long-standing questions in nuclear, high-energy, and condensed-matter physics, and may ultimately allow first-principles studies of matter evolution in settings ranging from the early universe to high-energy collisions. Research in this rapidly growing field is also driving the convergence of concepts across disciplines and uncovering new phenomena. In this Review, we highlight recent experimental and theoretical developments, focusing on phenomena accessible in current and near-term quantum simulators, including particle production and string breaking, collision dynamics, thermalization, ergodicity breaking, and dynamical quantum phase transitions. We conclude by outlining promising directions for future research and opportunities enabled by available quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and hydrodynamics: from quantum to classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in classical spin systems the precise nature of the late-time hydrodynamic tails of the autocorrelation functions of a generic observable is determined by (i) the dynamical critical exponent and (ii) the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the corresponding observable. We provide numerical results for one- and two-dimensional systems and present theoretical considerations that only rely on the notion of ergodicity. Our result extends to the classical framework the relaxation-overlap inequality, first introduced in Capizzi et al. Phys. Rev. X 15, 011059 (2025)] for quantum many-body systems satisfying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: Ytterbium-171 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{171}$Yb relevant to these applications. We emphasize experimental results and supplement these with theoretical estimates. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{171}$Yb (${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^1\mathrm{P}_1$, ${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}\,$, ${}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,2}\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{S}_1$, and ${}^3\mathrm{P}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{D}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving fermionic $^{171}$Yb.</description>

      <title>Observation of self-oscillating supersonic flow across an acoustic horizon in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics and stability of transonic flows in quantum fluids, especially for those beyond one spatial dimension, is an outstanding challenge, with applications ranging from nonlinear optics and condensed matter to analogue gravity. One intriguing possibility is that a system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, often lead to breakthroughs in the our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Pathways to Two-Dimensional Quantum Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation and decay kinetics of vortices in two dimensional, compressible quantum turbulence. We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay. These findings underscore the crucial role played by topological constraints in shaping nonlinear, turbulent evolution of two dimensional quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Optical probes of coherence in two dimensional Bose gases of polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their photonic components, exciton-polariton systems provide a convenient platform to study the coherence properties of weakly-interacting Bose gases. In particular, optical interferometry enables the measurement of the first-order coherence function which provides information about the intrinsic correlations of the system. In this paper, we derive a universal curve for the coherent fraction of a noninteracting, equilibrium, homogeneous, two-dimensional Bose gas, with density expressed in units of the observation area, and compare to recent experimental results. Although there is a sharp transition from normal to superfluid phases in the thermodynamic limit, the coherent fraction of the gas varies continuously across this transition due to the finite system size. We find that the theory agrees nearly perfectly with the experimental data in the low-density limit with no free parameters other than the effective temperature, highly constrained by the measurements. At higher density, the experiments are consistent with standard weakly-interacting Bose gas theory. By having a theory that treats both the optical diffraction and Bose coherence, we can clearly see the effect of the quantum statistics on the coherence.</description>

      <title>Emergent disorder and sub-ballistic dynamics in quantum simulations of the Ising model using Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays with Van der Waals interactions provide a controllable path to simulate the locally connected transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), a prototypical model in statistical mechanics. Remotely operating the publicly accessible Aquila Rydberg atom array, we experimentally investigate the physics of TFIM far from equilibrium and uncover significant deviations from the theoretical predictions. Rather than the expected ballistic spread of correlations, the Rydberg simulator exhibits a subballistic spread, along with a logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy in time - all while the system mostly retains its initial magnetization. By modeling the atom motion, we trace these effects to an emergent disorder in Rydberg atom arrays, which we characterize with a minimal random spin model. We further experimentally explore the different dynamical regimes hosted in the system by varying the lattice spacing and the Rabi frequency. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atom motion in the many-body dynamics of Rydberg atom arrays at the TFIM limit, and propose simple benchmark measurements to test for its presence in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</description>
