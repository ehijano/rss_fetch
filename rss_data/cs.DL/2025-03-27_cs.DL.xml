      <title>Measuring and Analyzing Subjective Uncertainty in Scientific Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty of scientific findings are typically reported through statistical metrics such as $p$-values, confidence intervals, etc. The magnitude of this objective uncertainty is reflected in the language used by the authors to report their findings primarily through expressions carrying uncertainty-inducing terms or phrases. This language uncertainty is a subjective concept and is highly dependent on the writing style of the authors. There is evidence that such subjective uncertainty influences the impact of science on public audience. In this work, we turned our focus to scientists themselves, and measured/analyzed the subjective uncertainty and its impact within scientific communities across different disciplines. We showed that the level of this type of uncertainty varies significantly across different fields, years of publication and geographical locations. We also studied the correlation between subjective uncertainty and several bibliographical metrics, such as number/gender of authors, centrality of the field's community, citation count, etc. The underlying patterns identified in this work are useful in identification and documentation of linguistic norms in scientific communication in different communities/societies.</description>

      <title>Tackling paper mills requires us to prevent future contamination and clean up the past -- the case of the journal Bioengineered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Taylor &amp; Francis journal Bioengineered has been targeted by paper mills. The goal of this study is to identify problematic articles published in Bioengineered during the period when the journal was affected by paper mills (2021-2022) and compare this to the number of problematic articles we can identify in the years prior (2019-2020).
  Methods: Dimensions was used to search for articles that contained the terms mouse OR mice OR rat OR rats in title or abstract, published in Bioengineered between January 1st 2010 to December 31st 2024. All articles were assessed by eye and by using software to detect inappropriate image duplication and manipulation. An article was classified as problematic if it contained inappropriate image duplication or manipulation or had been previously retracted. Problematic articles were reported on PubPeer by the authors, if they had not been reported previously. All included articles were assess for post-publication editorial decisions.
  Results: We have excluded all articles published in 2024 from further analysis, as these were all retraction notices. We assessed the remaining 878 articles, of which 226 (25.7%) were identified as problematic. Of the problematic articles, 35 had been previously retracted One article was retracted, which was later nullified. One article received a correction. None of the included articles received an expression of concern or the Taylor &amp; Francis under investigation pop-up.
  Conclusions: Taylor &amp; Francis lack of editorial action has left the scientific community vulnerable to reading and citing hundreds of problematic articles published in Bioengineered. To uphold scientific integrity, Taylor &amp; Francis should use the findings of this study as a starting point to systematically identify all compromised articles in Bioengineered and take appropriate editorial action.</description>

      <title>Resilience and Volatility in Academic Publishing, The Case of the University of Maribor 2004-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the dynamics of academic publishing resilience and volatility at Slovenia's University of Maribor (UM) from 2004 to 2023. This period was marked by significant economic pressures and policy shifts, including changes to higher education legislation and university funding. Using UM's employment data and OpenAlex publication records, the study examines the relationship between employed researcher numbers and unique authors publishing under the UM affiliation. Despite a substantial decrease in researcher employment during the 2009-2013 economic recession and austerity phase, the number of unique authors publishing with UM affiliation surprisingly increased. This growth was driven by factors such as a shift towards project-based funding, contributions from an expanding doctoral student cohort, and increased international collaborations. Analysis of author turnover reveals a notable contrast: high short-term volatility (annual churn rates of ~40-50%) versus significant mid-term stability (5-year churn rates of ~8-10%). Survival analysis confirms this trend, showing high initial attrition among publishing authors but long-term persistence for a core group. Furthermore, co-authorship network analysis indicates the UM research network has become more resilient over time. A critical finding is a fundamental shift in network structure around 2016, transitioning from dissassortative to assortative mixing, signaling profound changes in collaboration dynamics. The findings carry implications for research policy and university management, highlighting the necessity of balancing short-term performance indicators with the long-term stability and resilience essential for a thriving research community.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Digital Diplomatic Infrastructure: A Comparative Evaluation of Global Online Directories for Diplomatic Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comparative evaluation of global diplomatic mission directories. DiplomaticMonitor.org, EmbassyPages.com, and WikiData.org are strategically selected among the top ten global services. After analyzing nearly all available online global diplomatic directory services, these three platforms are selected as they represent fundamentally different approaches to creating worldwide diplomatic mission databases. Using official diplomatic lists from over 150 countries as benchmarks, we assessed data coverage, accuracy, and update frequency across these platforms. DiplomaticMonitor consistently outperforms its counterparts in structure, completeness, and timeliness, accurately reflecting ambassadorial appointment cycles and maintaining high precision across contact and personnel records. EmbassyPages, despite strong search engine visibility and widespread usage, exhibits significant data currency issues, with markedly diminished ambassadorial accuracy attributable to delayed refresh cycles. WikiData offers valuable historical documentation and open-source accessibility but lacks the consistency and verification protocols necessary for reliable real-time diplomatic information. Our findings highlight the critical challenge posed by the absence of a standardized global diplomatic mission registry. In this fragmented landscape, methodologically rigorous third-party platforms can occasionally surpass government-published records in quality and utility. The research demonstrates that in contemporary digital diplomacy, data reliability correlates less with institutional provenance than with disciplined, transparent, and consistent data stewardship practices.</description>

      <title>40 Years of Interdisciplinary Research: Phases, Origins, and Key Turning Points (1981-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the historical evolution of interdisciplinary research (IDR) over a 40-year period, focusing on its dynamic trends, phases, and key turning points. We apply time series analysis to identify critical years for interdisciplinary citations (CYICs) and categorizes IDR into three distinct phases based on these trends: Period I (1981-2002), marked by sporadic and limited interdisciplinary activity; Period II (2003-2016), characterized by the emergence of large-scale IDR led primarily by Medicine, with significant breakthroughs in cloning and medical technology; and Period III (2017-present), where IDR became a widely adopted research paradigm. Our findings indicate that IDR has been predominantly concentrated within the Natural Sciences, with Medicine consistently at the forefront, and highlights increasing contributions from Engineering and Environmental disciplines as a new trend. These insights enhance the understanding of the evolution of IDR, its driving factors, and the shifts in the focus of interdisciplinary collaborations.</description>
