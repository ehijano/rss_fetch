      <title>Retrieving Young Cloudy L-Dwarfs: A Nearby Planetary-Mass Companion BD+60 1417B and Its Isolated Red Twin W0047</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set of young, cloudy, red L-dwarfs -- CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 and WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 -- using the \textit{Brewster} retrieval framework. We also present the first elemental abundance measurements of the young K-dwarf (K0) host star, BD+60 1417 using high resolution~(R = 50,000) spectra taken with PEPSI/LBT. In the complex cloudy L-dwarf regime the emergence of condensate cloud species complicates retrieval analysis when only near-infrared data is available. We find that for both L dwarfs in this work, despite testing three different thermal profile parameterizations we are unable to constrain reliable abundance measurements and thus the C/O ratio. While we can not conclude what the abundances are, we can conclude that the data strongly favor a cloud model over a cloudless model. We note that the difficulty in retrieval constraints persists regardless of the signal to noise of the data examined (S/N $\sim$ 10 for CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 and~40 for WISEP J004701.06+680352.1). The results presented in this work provide valuable lessons about retrieving young, low-surface gravity, cloudy L-dwarfs. This work provides continued evidence of missing information in models and the crucial need for JWST to guide and inform retrieval analysis in this regime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on spectroscopic and photometric observations of the S-type Mira V667 Cas and the carbon star Mira OR Cep recorded during one pulsation cycle of each star in 2022. Spectra are calibrated in absolute flux using concurrent photometry. We present measurements of V and Ic magnitudes and V-Ic colour index, classify spectra in the revised MK system and investigate how absolute flux in the H-alpha to H-delta emission lines varies with pulsation phase for each star.</description>

      <title>Observations of Switchback Chains in a Double Solar Proton Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent research suggests a link in support of a model of switchback formation in the solar corona via interchange reconnection that is propagated outward with the solar wind and similarities in their ion composition to plasma instability produced plasmoids, these plasma instabilities have yet to be observationally linked to magnetic switchbacks. In this paper we aim to use the theoretical framework of a twin coronal mass ejection event which is known to include interchange reconnection processes and compare this model with experimental observations using Parker Solar Probe FIELDS and $\isis$ instrumentationof an actual event containing two CMEs identified via the associated solar proton event in order to further test and refine the hypothesis of interchange reconnection as a possible physical origin for the magnetic switchback phenomenon. We also intend to introduce a plasma model for the formation of the switchbacks noted within the CME event.</description>

      <title>Thermal Properties of Current Sheet Plasmas in Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current sheet is an essential feature in solar flares and is the primary site for magnetic reconnetion and energy release. Imaging observations feature a long linear structure above the candle-flame-shaped flare loops, which resembles the standard flare model with the current sheet viewed edge-on. We investigate the thermal properties of plasmas surrounding the linear sheet during flares, using EUV observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The differential emission measure (DEM) analyses show evidence of high temperatures in the plasma sheets (PSs), containing hot emissions from only a narrow temperature range, suggestive of an isothermal feature. The sheet's temperature remains constant at different heights above the flare arcade, peaking at around logT=7.0-7.1; while the well-studied 2017 September 10 X8.2 flare exhibits as an exception in that the temperature decreases with an increasing height and peaks higher (logT=7.25) during the gradual phase. Most PS cases also hold similar emission measures and thicknesses; while the PS's emissions drop exponentially above the flare arcade, the sheet thicknesses show no significant height association as for all the measurements. The characteristics of isothermal and steady temperature suggests balanced heating and cooling processes along the current sheet, particularly additional heating may exist to compensate for the conductive and radiative cooling away from the reconenction site. Our results suggest a steady and uniform sheet structure in the macroscopic scale that results from flare reconnection.</description>

      <title>Energetic Ion Composition as a Means of Investigating the Physical Origins of Alpha Particle Heavy Magnetic Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic switchbacks are of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the fact that the phenomenon has not been completely understood. Although most of the research into them in the Parker Solar Probe era has largely focused on creating a theoretical framework for causing the field reversal through magnetic interchange reconnection, reconnecting streams of plasma in the solar wind, or shear driven turbulence, it remains unclear to what extent these models may or may not represent the underlying physical reality of magnetic switchbacks. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using statistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying physics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the peak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are indicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated outwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly contradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven interchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the switchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.</description>

      <title>The impact of incorrect dissociation energies on inferred photospheric abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral synthesis codes are essential for inferring stellar parameters and detailed chemical abundances. These codes require many physical inputs to predict an emergent spectrum. Developers adopt the best measurements of those inputs at the time they release their code, but those measurements usually improve over time faster than the software is updated. In general, the impact of using incorrect or uncertain dissociation energies are largely unknown. Here we evaluate how incorrect dissociation energies impact abundances measured from C2, CN, CH, TiO, and MgO features. For each molecule we synthesised optical spectra of FGKM-type main-sequence and giant stars using the literature dissociation energy, and an incorrect (perturbed) dissociation energy. We find that the uncertainties in the dissociation energies adopted by spectral synthesis codes for CN, CH, TiO, and MgO lead to negligible differences in flux or abundances. C2 is the only diatomic molecule where the uncertainty of the inputted dissociation energy translates to a significant difference in flux, and carbon abundance differences of up to 0.2 dex. For Solar-like stars, the impact on carbon abundance is up to 0.09 dex. These large abundance differences demonstrate the importance of updating the inputs adopted by spectral synthesis codes, as well as a consensus on appropriate values between different codes.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Trigger Mechanism of Explosive Reconnection in Partially Ionized Solar Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability is usually accounted for the onset of fast reconnection events observed in astrophysical plasmas. However, the measured reconnection rate from observations can be one order of magnitude higher than that derived from MHD simulations. In this study, we present the results of magnetic reconnection in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere based on 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. The whole reconnection process covers two different fast reconnection phases. In the first phase, the slow Sweet-Parker reconnection transits to the plasmoid-mediated reconnection, and the reconnection rate reaches about 0.02. In the second phase, a faster explosive reconnection appears, with the reconnection rate reaching above 0.06. At the same time, a sharp decrease in plasma temperature and density at the principle X-point is observed which is associated with the strong radiative cooling, the ejection of hot plasma from the local reconnection region or the motion of principle X-point from hot and denser region to cool and less dense one along the narrow current sheet. This causes gas pressure depletion and the increasing of magnetic diffusion at the main X-point, resulting in the local Petschek-like reconnection and a violent and rapid increase in the reconnection rate. This study for the first time reveals a common phenomenon that the plasmoid dominated reconnection transits to an explosive faster reconnection with the rate approaching the order of 0.1 in partially ionized plasma in the MHD scale.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Chromospheric Umbral Waves in Sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillations are ubiquitous in sunspots and the associated higher atmospheres. However, it is still unclear whether these oscillations are driven by the external acoustic waves (p-modes) or generated by the internal magnetoconvection. To obtain clues about the driving source of umbral waves in sunspots, we analyzed the spiral wave patterns (SWPs) in two sunspots registered by IRIS MgII 2796 {\AA} slit-jaw images. By tracking the motion of the SWPs, we find for the first time that two one-armed SWPs coexist in the umbra, and they can rotate either in the same or opposite directions. Furthermore, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the oscillation centers of the one-armed SWPs within the umbra (the oscillation center is defined as the location where the SWP first appears), we find that the chromospheric umbral waves repeatedly originate from the regions with high oscillation power and most of the umbral waves occur in the dark nuclei and strong magnetic field regions of the umbra. Our study results indicate that the chromospheric umbral waves are likely excited by the p-mode oscillations.</description>

      <title>Search for Classical Cepheids in Galactic Open Clusters and Calibration of the Period Wesenheit Metallicity Relation in the Gaia Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is beneficial to calibrate the period Wesenheit metallicity relation (PWZR) of Delta Cephei stars (DCEPs), i.e., classical Cepheids, using accurate parallaxes of associated open clusters (OCs) from Gaia data release 3 (DR3). To this aim, we obtain a total of 43 OC-DCEPs (including 33 fundamental mode, 9 first overtone mode, and 1 multimode DCEPs.) and calibrate the PWZR as $W_G=(-3.356 \,\pm\, 0.033) \,(\log{P-1})+(-5.947 \,\pm\, 0.025)+(-0.285 \,\pm\, 0.064)[\textrm{Fe/H}]$. The concurrently obtained residual parallax offset in OC, $zp = -4\pm5\,\mu\textrm{as}$, demonstrate the adequacy of the parallax corrections within the magnitude range of OC member stars. By comparing the field DCEPs' DR3 parallaxes with their photometric parallaxes derived by our PWZR, we estimated the residual parallax offset in field DCEPs as $zp = -15\pm3\,\mu\textrm{as}$. Using our PWZR, we estimate the distance modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be $18.482 \,\pm\, 0.040$ mag, which aligns well with the most accurate published value obtained through geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Mass Transfer in Solar Flares: Insights from Elemental Abundance Evolutions Observed by Chang'E-2 Solar X-ray Monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how elemental abundances evolve during solar flares helps shed light on the mass and energy transfer between different solar atmospheric layers. However, prior studies have mostly concentrated on averaged abundances or specific flare phases, leaving a gap in exploring the comprehensive observations throughout the entire flare process. Consequently, investigations into this area are relatively scarce. Exploiting the Solar X-ray Monitor data obtained from the Chang'E-2 lunar orbiter, we present two comprehensive soft X-ray spectroscopic observations of flares in active regions, AR 11149 and 11158, demonstrating elemental abundance evolutions under different conditions. Our findings unveil the inverse first ionization potential (IFIP) effect during flares for Fe for the first time, and reaffirm its existence for Si. Additionally, we observed a rare depletion of elemental abundances, marking the second IFIP effect in flare decay phases. Our study offers a CSHKP model-based interpretation to elucidate the formation of both the FIP and IFIP effects in flare dynamics, with the inertia effect being incorporated into the ponderomotive force fractionation model.</description>

      <title>Probing Velocity Dispersion inside CMEs in Inner Corona: New Insights on CME Initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the kinematics of the leading edge and the core of 6 Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) in the combined field of view of Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and Image Processing (SWAP) on-board PRoject for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA-2) and the ground-based K-Cor coronagraph of the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO). We report, for the first time, on the existence of a critical height h$_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of velocity dispersion inside the CME. This height for the studied events lies between 1.4-1.8 R$_{\odot}$, in the inner corona. We find the critical heights to be relatively higher for gradual CMEs, as compared to impulsive ones, indicating that the early initiation of these two classes might be different physically. We find several interesting imprints of the velocity dispersion on CME kinematics. The critical height is strongly correlated with the flux-rope minor radius and the mass of the CME. Also, the magnitude of velocity dispersion shows a reasonable positive correlation with the above two parameters. We believe these results will advance our understanding of CME initiation mechanisms and will help provide improved constraints to CME initiation models.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Study of on-disk Coronal Hole Jets with IRIS and SDO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar jets are an important field of study, as they may contribute to the mass and energy transfer from the lower to the upper atmosphere. We use the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) observations to study two small-scale jets originating in the same on-disk coronal hole observed in October 2013. We combine dopplergrams, intensity maps, and line width maps derived from IRIS Si IV 1393.755{\AA} spectra along with images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO to describe the dynamics of the jets. Images from AIA, with the use of the emission measure loci technique and rectangular differential emission measure (DEM) distributions, provide estimations of the plasma temperatures. We used the O \textsc{IV} 1399.77 \AA, 1401.16~\AA\ spectral lines from IRIS to derive electron densities. For jet 1, the SDO images show a small mini-filament 2 minutes before the jet eruption, while jet 2 originates at a pre-existing coronal bright point. The analysis of asymmetric spectral profiles of the Si \textsc{IV} 1393.755~\AA\ and 1402.770~\AA\ lines reveals the existence of two spectral components with inversely dependant 1393.755~\AA/1402.770~\AA\ ratios at both regions. One of the components can be related to the background plasma emission originating outside the jet, while the secondary component represents higher-energy plasma flows associated with the jets. Both jets exhibit high densities of the order of 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ at their base and 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the spire, respectively, as well as similar average nonthermal velocities of $\sim$ 50-60 km/s. However, the two jets show differences in their length, duration, and plane-of-sky velocity. Finally, the DEM analysis reveals that both jets exhibit multithermal distributions.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic instability in rapidly accreting supermassive stars in the presence of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) via the general-relativistic (GR) instability would provide a natural explanation to the existence of the most extreme quasars. The presence of dark matter in SMSs is thought to potentially impact their properties, in particular their mass at collapse. Dark matter might be made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that can be captured by the gravitational potential well of SMSs due to interaction with the baryonic gas. The annihilation of WIMPs can provide fuel to support the star before H-burning ignition, favouring low densities of baryonic gas, long stellar lifetimes and high final masses. Here, we estimate the impact of dark matter on the GR dynamical stability of rapidly accreting SMSs. We add a dark matter term to the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations and apply it to hylotropic structures in order to determine the onset point of the GR instability. We find that, in principle, the dark matter gravitational field can remove completely the GR instability. However, for SMSs fuelled by H-burning, the dark matter densities required to stabilise the star against GR are orders of magnitude above the values that are expected for the dark matter background. On the other hand, for SMSs fuelled by WIMP annihilation, we find that the low densities of baryonic gas inhibit the destabilising GR corrections, which shifts the stability limit by typically an order of magnitude towards higher masses. As long as central temperatures $\lesssim10^7$ K are maintained by WIMP annihilation, the GR instability is reached only for stellar masses $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$. Dark matter can impact the GR dynamical stability of SMSs only in the case of energetically significant WIMP annihilation. The detection of a SMS with mass $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$ in an atomically cooled halo can be interpreted as an evidence of WIMP annihilation in the star's core.</description>

Abstract: Millimeter wavelength observations of Class II protoplanetary disks often display strong emission from hydrocarbons and high CS/SO values, providing evidence that the gas-phase C/O ratio commonly exceeds 1 in their outer regions. We present new NOEMA observations of CS $5-4$, SO $7_6-6_5$ and $5_6-4_5$, C$_2$H $N=3-2$, HCN $3-2$, HCO$^+$ $3-2$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $3-2$ in the DR Tau protoplanetary disk at a resolution of $\sim0.4''$ (80 au). Estimates for the disk-averaged CS/SO ratio range from $\sim0.4-0.5$, the lowest value reported thus far for a T Tauri disk. At a projected separation of $\sim180$ au northeast of the star, the SO moment maps exhibit a clump that has no counterpart in the other lines, and the CS/SO value decreases to $&lt;0.2$ at its location. Thermochemical models calculated with DALI indicate that DR Tau's low CS/SO ratio and faint C$_2$H emission can be explained by a gas-phase C/O ratio that is $&lt;1$ at the disk radii traced by NOEMA. Comparisons of DR Tau's SO emission to maps of extended structures traced by $^{13}$CO suggest that late infall may contribute to driving down the gas-phase C/O ratio of its disk.</description>

      <title>Realistic binary neutron star initial data with Elliptica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Elliptica pseudo-spectral code for generating initial data of binary neutron star systems. Building upon the recent Elliptica code update, we can now construct initial data using not only piecewise polytropic equations of state, but also tabulated equations of state for these binary systems. Furthermore, the code allows us to endow neutron stars within the binary system with spins. These spins can have a magnitude close to the mass shedding limit and can point in any direction.</description>

      <title>Tayler-Spruit dynamo in stably stratified rotating fluids: Application to proto-magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of highly magnetized young neutron stars, called magnetars, is still a strongly debated question. A promising scenario invokes the amplification of the magnetic field by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo in a proto-neutron star (PNS) spun up by fallback. Barr\`ere et al. 2023 supports this scenario by demonstrating that this dynamo can generate magnetar-like magnetic fields in stably stratified Boussinesq models of a PNS interior. To further investigate the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, we perform 3D-MHD numerical simulations with the MagIC code varying the ratio between the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and the rotation rate. We first demonstrate that a self-sustained dynamo process can be maintained for a Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency about 4 times higher than the angular rotation frequency. The generated magnetic fields and angular momentum transport follow the analytical scaling laws of Fuller et al. 2019, which confirms our previous results. We also report for the first time the existence of an intermittent Tayler-Spruit dynamo. For a typical PNS Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency of $10^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, the axisymmetric toroidal and dipolar magnetic fields range between $1.2\times 10^{15}-2\times 10^{16}\,{\rm G}$ and $1.4\times 10^{13}-3\times 10^{15}\,{\rm G}$, for rotation periods of $1-10\,{\rm ms}$. Thus, our results provide numerical evidence that our scenario can explain the formation of magnetars. As the Tayler-Spruit dynamo is often invoked for the angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones, our results are also of particular importance in this field and we provide a calibration of the Fuller et al.'s prescription based on our simulations, with a dimensionless normalisation factor of the order of $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Diffuse Molecular Media with Non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Consistent Thermochemistry: Numerical Simulations and Dynamic Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffuse molecular clouds can exhibit complicated morphologies caused by the interactions among radiation, chemistry, fluids, and fields. We performed full 3D simulations for turbulent diffuse molecular interstellar media, featuring time-dependent non-equilibrium thermochemistry co-evolved with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Simulation results exhibit the relative abundances of key chemical species (e.g., C, CO, OH) vary by more than one order of magnitude for the "premature" epoch of chemical evolution ($t\lesssim 2\times 10^5~{\rm yr}$). Various simulations are also conducted to study the impacts of physical parameters. Non-ideal MHD effects are essential in shaping the behavior of gases, and strong magnetic fields ($\sim 10~\mu{\rm G}$) tend to inhibit vigorous compressions and thus reduce the fraction of warm gases ($T\gtrsim 10^2~{\rm K}$). Thermodynamical and chemical conditions of the gas are sensitive to modulation by dynamic conditions, especially the energy injection by turbulence. Chemical features, including ionization (cosmic ray and diffuse interstellar radiation), would not directly affect the turbulence power spectra. Nonetheless, their effects are prominent in the distribution profiles of temperatures and gas densities. Comprehensive observations are necessary and useful to eliminate the degeneracies of physical parameters and constrain the properties of diffuse molecular clouds with confidence.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and solar wind control of the recovery of strong geomagnetic storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the characteristics and dynamical changes during the recovery time of moderate and strong geomagnetic storms (Dst $&lt;-50$ nT). Investigating 57 storms triggered by CMEs/CIRs, we focused on the solar wind's influence on their decay phases. Selected storms were classified into distinct groups based on their recovery characteristics. Using superposed epoch analysis and best fit methods, we scrutinized several interplanetary solar wind plasma and field parameters/functions. The analysis included single, dual, and multiple interplanetary plasma and field parameters/functions. We determined the most representative characteristic time for the storm's recovery profile by fitting an exponential curve. A correlation analysis between Dst and solar wind parameters/functions isolated a coupling function ($\rho^{1/2}$Ey) best describing the decay rate of the ring current. This shows that the electric field term (Ey) coupled with a viscous term ($\rho^{1/2}$) plays a pivotal role in determining the recovery rate of geomagnetic storms. Additionally, we modeled the complex patterns of Dst recovery in relation to solar wind parameters/functions using a second-order polynomial. During the recovery phase, a dynamic correlation between Dst and solar wind parameters/functions was revealed. The three-parameter solar wind-magnetosphere electrodynamical coupling function, combining the viscous term ($\rho^{1/2}$) and the electric field-related function (v$^{4/3}$B) ($\rho^{1/2}$v$^{4/3}$B), significantly impacts the recovery phase of geomagnetic disturbances. Our investigation extended to the relationship between main and recovery phase durations, providing valuable insights into the solar wind's control over the decay of geomagnetic disturbances. These findings advance our comprehension of the complex relationship between solar wind dynamics and the evolution of geomagnetic disturbances.</description>

      <title>A JWST Medium Resolution MIRI Spectrum and Models of the Type Ia supernova 2021aefx at +415 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum (5-27 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021aefx at $+415$ days past $B$-band maximum. The spectrum, which was obtained during the iron-dominated nebular phase, has been analyzed in combination with previous JWST observations of SN 2021aefx, to provide the first JWST time series analysis of an SN Ia. We find the temporal evolution of the [Co III] 11.888 $\mathrm{\mu}$m feature directly traces the decay of $^{56}$Co. The spectra, line profiles, and their evolution are analyzed with off-center delayed-detonation models. Best fits were obtained with White Dwarf (WD) central densities of $\rho_c=0.9-1.1\times 10^9$g cm$^{-3}$, a WD mass of M$_{\mathrm{WD}}$=1.33-1.35M$_\odot$, a WD magnetic field of $\approx10^6$G, and an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition at $\approx$ 0.5 $M_\odot$ seen opposite to the line of sight of the observer (-30). The inner electron capture core is dominated by energy deposition from $\gamma$-rays whereas a broader region is dominated by positron deposition, placing SN 2021aefx at +415 d in the transitional phase of the evolution to the positron-dominated regime. The formerly `flat-tilted' profile at 9 $\mathrm{\mu}$m now has significant contribution from [Ni IV], [Fe II], and [Fe III] and less from [Ar III], which alters the shape of the feature as positrons excite mostly the low-velocity Ar. Overall, the strength of the stable Ni features in the spectrum is dominated by positron transport rather than the Ni mass. Based on multi-dimensional models, our analysis is consistent with a single-spot, close-to-central ignition with an indication for a pre-existing turbulent velocity field, and excludes a multiple-spot, off-center ignition.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Synthesis of Magnetic Tornado: Co-spatial Incidence of Chromospheric Swirls and EUV Brightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic tornadoes, characterized as impulsive Alfven waves initiated by photospheric vortices in intergranular lanes, are considered efficient energy channels to the corona. Despite their acknowledged importance for solar coronal heating, their observational counterparts from the corona have not been well understood. To address this issue, we use a radiative MHD simulation of a coronal loop with footpoints rooted in the upper convection zone, and synthesize the chromospheric and coronal emissions corresponding to a magnetic tornado. Considering SDO/AIA 171 A and Solar Orbiter/EUI 174 A channels, our synthesis reveals that the coronal response to magnetic tornadoes can be observed as an EUV brightening of which width is ~2 Mm. This brightening is located above the synthesized chromospheric swirl observed in Ca II 8542 A, Ca II K, and Mg II k lines, which can be detected by instruments such as SST/CRISP, GST/FISS, and IRIS. Considering the height correspondence of the synthesized brightening, magnetic tornadoes can be an alternative mechanism for the small-scale EUV brightenings such as the solar "campfires''. Our findings indicate that coordinated observations encompassing the chromosphere to the corona are indispensable for comprehending the origin of coronal EUV brightenings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normalization coefficients for $\alpha+ {}^{12}{\rm C}$ synthesis and the $S$-factor for ${}^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha, \,\gamma){}^{16}{\rm O}$ radiative capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction, determining the survival of carbon in red giants, is of interest for nuclear reaction theory and nuclear astrophysics. A specific feature of the $^{16}$O nuclear structure is the presence of two subthreshold bound states, (6.92 MeV, 2$^+$) and (7.12 MeV, 1$^-$), that dominate the behavior of the low-energy $S$-factor. The strength of these subthreshold states is determined by their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs), which need to be known with high accuracy. Recently, using a model-independent extrapolation method, Blokhintsev {\it et al.} [Eur. Phys. J. A {\bf 59} (2023) 162] determined the ANCs for the $\alpha$-particle removal taking into account three subthreshold states in $^{16}$O. The goal of this paper is to address four main problems elucidating the impact of the subthreshold ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor. Firstly, we analyse the connection between variations of the subthreshold ANCs and the low-energy $S$-factor, in particular, at the most effective energy of $300$ keV. Secondly, we calculate contributions to the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor from the subthreshold $1^{-}$ and $2^{+}$ resonances, that are controlled by the subthreshold ANCs. We also evaluate the contribution of the uncertainties of the subthreshold ANCs to the budget of the low-energy $S$-factor uncertainty, especially, the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor. Thirdly, we analyse interference of the subthreshold resonances (SRs) with higher resonances and with the $E1$ and $E2$ direct captures to the ground state. Finally, we investigate a correlated effect of the subthreshold and ground-state ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor and, in particular, on the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) IX. The largest detailed chemical analysis of very metal-poor stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most metal-poor stars provide valuable insights into the early chemical enrichment history of a system, carrying the chemical imprints of the first generations of supernovae. The most metal-poor region of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy remains inadequately observed and characterised. To date, only $\sim4$ stars with [Fe/H]~$&lt;-2.0$ have been chemically analysed with high-resolution spectroscopy. In this study, we present the most extensive chemical abundance analysis of 12 low-metallicity stars with metallicities down to [Fe/H]~$=-3.26$ and located in the main body of Sagittarius. These targets, selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, were observed using the MIKE high-resolution spectrograph at the {\it Magellan-Clay} telescope, which allowed us to measure up to 17 chemical species. The chemical composition of these stars reflects the imprint of a variety of type~II supernovae (SNe~II). A combination of low- to intermediate-mass high-energy SNe and hypernovae ($\sim10-70\msun$) is required to account for the abundance patterns of the lighter elements up to the Fe-peak. The trend of the heavy elements suggests the involvement of compact binary merger events and fast-rotating (up to $\sim300\kms$) intermediate-mass to massive metal-poor stars ($\sim25-120\msun$) that are the sources of rapid and slow processes, respectively. Additionally, asymptotic giant branch stars contribute to a wide dispersion of [Ba/Mg] and [Ba/Eu]. The absence of an $\alpha-$knee in our data indicates that type Ia supernovae did not contribute in the very metal-poor region ([Fe/H]~$\leq-2.0$). However, they might have started to pollute the interstellar medium at [Fe/H]~$&gt;-2.0$, given the relatively low [Co/Fe] in this metallicity region.</description>
