      <title>Controlled angular momentum injection in a magnetically levitated He II droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of rotating viscous classical liquid droplets has been extensively studied and is well understood. However, our understanding of rotating superfluid droplets remains limited. For instance, superfluid $^4$He (He II) can carry angular momentum through two distinct mechanisms: the formation of an array of quantized vortex lines, which induce flows resembling classical solid-body rotation, and surface traveling deformation modes associated with irrotational internal flows. These two mechanisms can result in significantly different droplet morphologies, and it remains unclear how the injected angular momentum is partitioned between them. To investigate this complex problem experimentally, one must first levitate an isolated He II droplet using techniques such as magnetic levitation. However, an outstanding challenge lies in effectively injecting angular momentum into the levitated droplet. In this paper, we describe a magneto-optical cryostat system designed to levitate He II droplets and present the design of a time-dependent, non-axially symmetric electric driving system. Based on our numerical simulations, this system should enable controlled angular momentum injection into the droplet. This study lays the foundation for future investigations into the morphology of rotating He II droplets.</description>

      <title>Realization of inverse-design magnonic logic gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonic logic gates represent a crucial step toward realizing fully magnonic data processing systems without reliance on conventional electronic or photonic elements. Recently, a universal and reconfigurable inverse-design device has been developed, featuring a 7$\times$7 array of independent current loops that create local inhomogeneous magnetic fields to scatter spin waves in a Yttrium-Iron-Garnet film. While initially used for linear RF components, we now demonstrate key non-linear logic gates, NOT, OR, NOR, AND, NAND, and a half-adder, sufficient for building a full processor. In this system, binary data ("0" and "1") are encoded in the spin-wave amplitude. The contrast ratio, representing the difference between logic states, achieved values of 34, 53.9, 11.8, 19.7, 17, and 9.8 dB for these gates, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>

      <title>Tower of Structured Excited States from Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing highly entangled quantum states is a key challenge in quantum metrology and quantum information science. Measurements, especially those of global observables, offer a simple and efficient way to generate entanglement between subsystems when they are measured as a whole. We introduce a log-depth protocol leveraging quantum phase estimation to measure a global observable, such as total magnetization and momentum. We demonstrate its capability to prepare towers of structured excited states that are useful in quantum metrology; examples include quantum many-body scars in various models, including the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, the constrained domain-wall model, and the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ XX chains. The same method is also applicable to preparing the Dicke states of high weight. In addition, we propose a protocol for momentum measurement that avoids disturbing the system, facilitating the preparation of states beyond the above construction, such as the Arovas $A$ state of the AKLT Hamiltonian. Our results expand the utility of measurement-based approaches to accessing highly entangled states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states. We find that, in stark contrast to displacement and two-photon squeezing, higher-order squeezing leads to oscillatory dynamics. The state is squeezed in the initial stages of the dynamics but the squeezing reverses at later stages, and the state reverts almost completely back to the initial state. We analyze various quantities to verify that the oscillatory dynamics is physical and not a mathematical artefact. We also show that the maximum squeezing diminishes with increasing squeezing order, rendering the squeezing mechanism increasingly ineffective. Our results provide important rules that can help guide the development of more effective higher-order squeezing techniques.</description>
