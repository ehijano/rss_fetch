      <title>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration free models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple intra-unit-cell magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. Straight-forward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>

      <title>High spin, low spin or gapped spins: magnetism in the bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-chiral phonon splitting from octupolar magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of anomalously large magnetic response of chiral phonons in dipolar magnets, we explore an extension to study Einstein quantum phonon modes coupled to multipolar moments. We consider the case of non-Kramers $\Gamma_3$ doublets which encapsulate quadrupolar and Ising octupolar degrees of freedom, and which feature a symmetry-allowed linear coupling between local quadrupolar moments and Raman active $E_g$ phonon modes $(d_{x^2-y^2},d_{3z^2-r^2})$. We show that either octupolar or quadrupolar ordering leads to degeneracy breaking of the $E_g$ phonon doublet, with ferro-octupolar order favoring pseudo-chiral phonon eigenmodes with a detectable energy splitting. We describe this physics using a path integral approach in the limit where `fast' phonon modes sense the `slow' pseudospins as a static background which we average over using Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss implications for materials such as Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ and PrV$_2$Al$_{20}$ where Raman spectroscopy of phonons could be used as a potential probe of hidden octupolar order. Our work extends the important concept of chiral phonons to a large class of multipolar magnets.</description>

      <title>Strong Correlations, Green's Function Zeros and Topological Transitions in Orbital-Symmetry-Controlled Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We integrate concepts from topological band theory and strong-correlation physics with the principle of orbital symmetry conservation, which characterizes reactions as symmetry allowed or forbidden based on whether molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. Using a $4\pi$ electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations, resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: III. Thermodynamic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.</description>

      <title>High Pressure Growth of Transition-Metal Monosilicide RhGe Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal monosilicide RhGe has been reported to exhibit weak itinerant ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and topological properties. In this study, we report the high-pressure growth of high-quality RhGe single crystals up to millimeter size using flux method. Transport measurements reveal the metallic behavior of RhGe between 2-300 K with Fermi liquid behavior at low temperature region. However, no superconductivity was observed with variations in Ge composition. Magnetic characterizations indicate that RhGe exhibits a paramagnetic behavior between 2-300 K. The high-quality, large-size RhGe single crystals pave the way for further investigation of their topological properties using spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>The electronic structure of a doped Mott-Hubbard surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sn/Si(111)-({\sqrt}3{\times}{\sqrt}3)R30{\deg} surface, a 2D Mott insulator, has long been predicted and then found experimetally to metallize and even turn superconducting upon boron doping. In order to clarify the structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered. These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further understanding of this fascinating system.</description>

      <title>Cluster Spin Glass State in Ba$_3$Sb$_{1+x}$Co$_{2-x}$O$_{9-\delta}$: Cation Disorder and Mixed-Valence Co Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of \BSCO\ ($x$ = 0.04, $\delta$ = 0.54), a hexagonal perovskite featuring face-sharing CoO$_6$ octahedra that forms Co dimers. DC and AC magnetization measurements reveal a frequency-dependent spin-freezing transition consistent with glassy dynamics. AC susceptibility fits best to the Vogel-Fulcher model, indicating collective freezing of interacting spin clusters. Isothermal magnetization follows the Langevin function, suggesting finite-sized magnetic clusters rather than isolated paramagnetic moments. Non-equilibrium dynamics, evidenced by thermoremanent magnetization and memory effects, further support a spin-glass-like state. Heat capacity shows no sharp anomalies, and neutron powder diffraction confirms the absence of magnetic Bragg peaks down to 1.5~K, ruling out long-range magnetic order. Rietveld refinement reveals significant Co/Sb intersite disorder ($\sim$~30\pct) and oxygen non-stoichiometry, introducing exchange randomness and frustration that drive the spin-glass-like behavior. Electrical resistivity exhibits Arrhenius-type temperature dependence with an activation energy of 0.173~eV, consistent with semiconducting behavior. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction shows no structural phase transitions, confirming that the spin-glass-like state is not lattice-driven. Our results establish \BSCO\ as a cluster spin-glass candidate, where Co dimers, disorder, and geometric frustration prevent long-range order, leading to slow spin dynamics. These findings highlight the role of cation disorder and oxygen vacancies in stabilizing unconventional magnetic states in cobalt-based hexagonal perovskites.</description>

      <title>Exploring Low-Dimensional Magnetism in Cobalt Vanadates, ${A}$CoV$_{2}$O$_{7}$~(${A}$~=~Ca, Sr) : Crystal Growth and Magnetic Properties of Effective Spin-1/2 Zigzag Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the successful growth of high-quality single crystals of \ACVO, a quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chain compound containing Co$^{2+}$ ions, using the optical floating zone method. The crystal growth was stabilized under high-pressure argon-oxygen gas with slow growth rates, overcoming challenges associated with the incongruent melting behavior of this material. X-ray diffraction confirms the zigzag arrangement of Co$^{2+}$ ions, forming a quasi-one-dimensional chain structure. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic phase transition at the N\'eel temperature ($T_{\text{N}} \sim 3.5$ K) and negative Curie-Weiss temperatures, indicative of dominant antiferromagnetic interactions. The distorted CoO$_6$ octahedral geometry and strong spin-orbit coupling suggest that Co$^{2+}$ ions likely exhibit an effective $J = 1/2 $ Kramers doublet state. The results presented here demonstrate the potential of \ACVO\ as a platform for investigating low-dimensional magnetism and quantum magnetic phenomena. These insights shed light on the role of the ${A}$-site ion in tuning the magnetic interactions, which will foster future research into the field-induced behavior in these cobalt vanadates.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Collapse and Luttinger Liquids In Twisted Anisotropic Homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce twisted anisotropic homobilayers as a distinct class of moir\'e systems, characterized by a distinctive ``magic angle", $\theta_M$, where both the moir\'e unit cell and Brillouin zone collapse. Unlike conventional studies of moir\'e materials, which primarily focus on small lattice misalignments, we demonstrate that this moir\'e collapse occurs at large twist angles in generic twisted anisotropic homobilayers. The collapse angle, $\theta_M$, is likely to give rise quasi-crystal behavior as well as to the formation of strongly correlated states, that arise not from flat bands, but from the presence of ultra-anisotropic electronic states, where non-Fermi liquid phases can be stabilized. In this work, we develop a continuum model for electrons based on extensive \textit{ab initio} calculations for twisted bilayer black phosphorus, enabling a detailed study of the emerging moir\'e collapse features in this archetypal system. We show that the (temperature) stability criterion for the emergence of (sliding) Luttinger liquids is generally met as the twist angle approaches $\theta_M$. Furthermore, we explicitly formulate the collapsed single-particle one-dimensional (1D) continuum Hamiltonian and provide the \textit{fully interacting}, bosonized Hamiltonian applicable at low doping levels. Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of multichannel Luttinger liquids, potentially enhanced by valley degrees of freedom at large twist angles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A supercurrent is well recognized as being of prime importance within mean-field theory, but remains largely unexplored in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) and the quantum critical region. To clarify the impact of the supercurrent on magnetism and superconductivity near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, we study the two-dimensional Hubbard model based on a fluctuation exchange approximation for a current-carrying superconducting state. We show a supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetism and emergence of spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The former results from Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, suppression in the superconducting gap, and strong correlation effects beyond the mean-field theory. Our results suggest that the supercurrent can bring out rich phenomena of superconductivity in SCES.</description>

      <title>Efficient Berry Phase Calculation via Adaptive Variational Quantum Computing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing approach for efficiently calculating the Berry phase in topological Hamiltonians. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Counting in the Rydberg Blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for approximately counting the number of solutions to planar 2-satisfiability (2SAT) formulas natively on neutral atom quantum computers. Our algorithm maps Boolean variables to atomic registers arranged in space according to a given formula, so that 2SAT constraints are enforced via the Rydberg blockade between neighboring atoms. A quench under Rydberg dynamics of an initial computational basis state produces a superposition of all solutions after a sufficiently long evolution. For almost uniform superpositions, a polynomial number of measurements is enough to estimate the solution count up to any constant multiplicative factor via sampling based counting. We demonstrate numerically that this protocol leads to almost uniform solution sampling in 1D and 2D grids and that it produces accurate counts for 2SAT instances on punctured grids, suggesting its general applicability as a heuristic for #P-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Tunable phase transitions from semimetals to Chern insulators in two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate how static symmetry-breaking perturbations and dynamic Floquet terms via a polarized light manipulate the topological phase transitions in the two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing-point (QBCP) materials. The Berry curvature shows distinct behavior in such two situations. It is linearly and quadratically proportional to the product of microstructural parameters $t_{x,z}$ for the former and the latter, respectively. The static perturbation eliminates the QBCP and opens an energy gap, which leads to the momentum-inversion symmetry of Berry curvature. This yields a nontrivial Chern number determined by the microstructural parameters. In contrast, we demonstrate that either a circularly or an elliptically polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, transforming the QBCP semimetal into a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} = Ce^2/\hbar$, where the Chern number is governed by the polarization angle. Moreover, the linear polarization preserves the central antisymmetry of the Berry curvature, giving rise to a topological trivial insulator. These results establish a tunable topological phase transition from a QBCP semimetal to Chern insulator in the two-dimensional QBCP materials.</description>

Abstract: Helical spin textures in one-dimensional magnetic chains on superconductors can enable topological superconductivity and host Majorana zero modes, independent of the presence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that gadolinium (Gd) adatoms, possessing large 4f magnetic moments when placed on a Nb(110) surface, establish indirect exchange interactions mediated by valence electrons, manifesting as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy with density functional theory, we analyze the emergence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in single Gd atoms and Gd dimers and uncover the underlying magnetic interaction mechanisms, on the basis of which we predict by means of spin-dynamics simulations the formation of stable chiral N\'eel-type spin-spiral configurations in Gd chains. These findings highlight rare-earth magnets as a promising platform for precisely tuning spin-spiral ground states, an essential prerequisite for the realization of topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in holographic junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.</description>

      <title>Electric-field Quantum Sensing Exploiting a Photogenerated Charge-transfer Triplet State in a Molecular Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately, comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Symmetry Breaking and Interactions in a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the one dimensional massive Thirring model or equivalently the sine-Gordon model in the repulsive regime with general Dirichlet boundary conditions, which are characterized by two boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}$ associated with the left and right boundaries respectively. In the presence of these boundary fields, which explicitly break the charge conjugation symmetry, the system exhibits a duality symmetry which changes the sign of the mass parameter $m_0$ and shifts the values of the boundary fields by $\phi_{L,R}\rightarrow \phi_{L,R}+\pi$. When the mass parameter $m_0&lt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, or equivalently due to duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0&gt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, the system is at a trivial point. Here, the ground state is unique just as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, when the mass parameter $m_0&lt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, and equivalently due to the duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0&gt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, the system is at a topological point where it exhibits a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, which is characterized by the existence of zero energy bound states at both the boundaries. For a given value of the mass parameter $m_0$, we find that these phases remain stable in the presence of symmetry breaking fields at the boundary, provided they are smaller than certain critical values which depend on the strength of the interactions in the bulk. Hence, we show that the stability of the SPT and trivial phases depends on the interplay of the symmetry breaking boundary field values and the bulk interaction strength.</description>

      <title>First-principle Study of Multiple Metastable Charge Ordering States in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: La doped SrFeO$_{3}$, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$, exhibits a metal-to-insulator transition accompanied by both antiferromagnetic and charge ordering states along with the Fe-O bond disproportionation below a critical temperature near 200K. Unconventionally slow charge dynamics measured in this material near the critical temperature shows that its excited charge ordering states can exhibit novel electronic structures with nontrivial energy profiles. Here, we reveal possible metastable states of charge ordering structures in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ using the first-principle and climbing image nudged elastic band methods. In the strong correlation regime, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a charge ordering state of the big-small-big pattern, consistent with the experimental measurement of this material at the low temperature. As the correlation effect becomes weak, we find at least two possible metastable charge ordering states with the distinct Fe-O bond disproportionation. Remarkably, a ferroelectric metallic state emerges with the small energy barrier of $\sim$7 meV, driven by a metastable CO state of the small-medium-big pattern. The electronic structures of these metastable charge ordering states are noticeably different from those of the ground-state. Our results can provide an insightful explanation to multiple metastable charge ordering states and the slow charge dynamics of this and related oxide materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the exchange interaction in a system of spatially disordered magnetic moments. A typical example of such a system is an impurity semiconductor, whose magnetic properties are associated with the exchange interaction of the impurity atoms. In this study, we consider the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which we describe by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method. Our calculations demonstrate a good quantitative agreement with the dependence of the Si:P magnetic susceptibility on temperature in a wide range of impurity concentrations and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional spin helix and magnon-induced singularity in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits prominent correlated phenomena in two distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures.</description>

      <title>Momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling in cuprates by RIXS: the roles of phonon symmetry and electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions for several high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. Namely, we investigate the intensity of the bond-stretching phonon mode in CaCuO$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ along the high symmetry ($\zeta$,0), ($\zeta$,$\zeta$) directions and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at fixed modulus of the in-plane momentum $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$. Using two different theoretical approaches for the description of the RIXS scattering from phonons, we find that the $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$-dependence of the RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be used to test advanced theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recently developed orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n$-Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo method arises for the double occupancy as well as qualitative agreement for the filling and compressibility across the Mott transition. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as a useful alternative perspective for studying strong correlations in SU($N$) systems.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>

Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Although the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite-temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</description>
