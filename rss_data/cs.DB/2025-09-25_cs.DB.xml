      <title>About the Multi-Head Linear Restricted Chase Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chase is a ubiquitous algorithm in database theory. However, for existential rules (aka tuple-generating dependencies), its termination is not guaranteed, and even undecidable in general. The problem of termination becomes particularly difficult for the restricted (or standard) chase, for which the order of rule application matters. Thus, decidability of restricted chase termination is still open for many well-behaved classes such as linear or guarded multi-headed rules. We make a step forward by showing that all-instances restricted chase termination is decidable in the linear multi-headed case.</description>

      <title>STARQA: A Question Answering Dataset for Complex Analytical Reasoning over Structured Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic parsing methods for converting text to SQL queries enable question answering over structured data and can greatly benefit analysts who routinely perform complex analytics on vast data stored in specialized relational databases. Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL, the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.</description>

      <title>Gamma Acyclicity, Annotated Relations, and Consistency Witness Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the early days of relational database theory it was realized that "acyclic" database schemas possess a number of desirable semantic properties. In fact, three different notions of "acyclicity" were identified and extensively investigated during the 1980s, namely, alpha-acyclicity, beta-acyclicity, and gamma-acyclicity. Much more recently, the study of alpha-acyclicity was extended to annotated relations, where the annotations are values from some positive commutative monoid. The recent results about alpha-acyclic schemas and annotated relations give rise to results about beta-acyclic schemas and annotated relations, since a schema is beta-acyclic if and only if every sub-schema of it is alpha-acyclic. Here, we study gamma-acyclic schemas and annotated relations. Our main finding is that the desirable semantic properties of gamma-acyclic schemas extend to annotated relations, provided the annotations come from a positive commutative monoid that has the transportation property. Furthermore, the results reported here shed light on the role of the join of two standard relations, Specifically, our results reveal that the only relevant property of the join of two standard relations is that it is a witness to the consistency of the two relations, provided that these two relations are consistent. For the more abstract setting of annotated relations, this property of the standard join is captured by the notion of a consistency witness function, a notion which we systematically investigate in this work.</description>

      <title>ARCADE: A Real-Time Data System for Hybrid and Continuous Query Processing across Diverse Data Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data - spanning text, image, video, spatial, and relational modalities, coupled with the need for real-time semantic search and retrieval over these data - has outpaced the capabilities of existing multimodal and real-time database systems, which either lack efficient ingestion and continuous query capability, or fall short in supporting expressive hybrid analytics. We introduce ARCADE, a real-time data system that efficiently supports high-throughput ingestion and expressive hybrid and continuous query processing across diverse data types. ARCADE introduces unified disk-based secondary index on LSM-based storage for vector, spatial, and text data modalities, a comprehensive cost-based query optimizer for hybrid queries, and an incremental materialized view framework for efficient continuous queries. Built on open-source RocksDB storage and MySQL query engine, ARCADE outperforms leading multimodal data systems by up to 7.4x on read-heavy and 1.4x on write-heavy workloads.</description>

      <title>Output-Sensitive Evaluation of Acyclic Conjunctive Regular Path Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjunctive Regular Path Queries, or CRPQs for short, are an essential construct in graph query languages. In this paper, we propose the first output-sensitive algorithm for evaluating acyclic CRPQs. It is output-sensitive in the sense that its complexity is a function of the sizes of the input graph and of the query output. In particular, it does not depend on the output sizes of the regular expressions that appear in the query, as these sizes can be much larger than the query output size.
  Our algorithm proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, it contracts the given query into a free-connex acyclic one such that the output of the original query can be obtained from the output of the contracted one. This contraction removes bound variables by composing regular expressions or by promoting bound variables to free ones. The minimum necessary number of promoted bound variables gives the contraction width, which is a novel parameter specific to CRPQs. In the second stage, our algorithm evaluates the free-connex acyclic CRPQ and projects away the columns of the promoted bound variables. It ensures output-sensitivity by computing the calibrated outputs of the regular expressions appearing in the free-connex acyclic CRPQ in time proportional to their sizes.
  Our algorithm has lower complexity than the state-of-the-art approaches for problem instances where (i) the query output is asymptotically smaller than the worst-case output size or (ii) the largest output size of any of the regular expression in the query.</description>

      <title>FusedANN: Convexified Hybrid ANN via Attribute-Vector Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g., "top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall, speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient, and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically, FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages, achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems. Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled, scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large, hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.</description>

      <title>Play by the Type Rules: Inferring Constraints for LLM Functions in Declarative Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful, generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents. Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then, we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We make our implementation available at https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql</description>

      <title>Extremal Fitting Problems for Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fitting problem for conjunctive queries (CQs) is the problem to construct a CQ that fits a given set of labeled data examples. When a fitting CQ exists, it is in general not unique. This leads us to proposing natural refinements of the notion of a fitting CQ, such as most-general fitting CQ, most-specific fitting CQ, and unique fitting CQ. We give structural characterizations of these notions in terms of (suitable refinements of) homomorphism dualities, frontiers, and direct products, which enable the construction of the refined fitting CQs when they exist. We also pinpoint the complexity of the associated existence and verification problems, and determine the size of fitting CQs. We study the same problems for UCQs and for the more restricted class of tree CQs.</description>

      <title>Factorised Representations of Join Queries: Tight Bounds and a New Dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common theme in factorised databases and knowledge compilation is the representation of solution sets in a useful yet succinct data structure. In this paper, we study the representation of the result of join queries (or, equivalently, the set of homomorphisms between two relational structures). We focus on the very general format of $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits -- also known as d-representations or DNNF circuits -- and aim to find the limits of this approach.
  In prior work, it has been shown that there always exists a $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits-circuit of size $N^{O(subw)}$ representing the query result, where N is the size of the database and subw the submodular width of the query. If the arity of all relations is bounded by a constant, then subw is linear in the treewidth tw of the query. In this setting, the authors of this paper proved a lower bound of $N^{\Omega(tw^{\varepsilon})}$ on the circuit size (ICALP 2023), where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ depends on the excluded grid theorem.
  Our first main contribution is to improve this lower bound to $N^{\Omega(tw)}$, which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent. Our second contribution is a $N^{\Omega(subw^{1/4})}$ lower bound on the circuit size for join queries over relations of unbounded arity. Both lower bounds are unconditional lower bounds on the circuit size for well-chosen database instances. Their proofs use a combination of structural (hyper)graph theory with communication complexity in a simple yet novel way. While the second lower bound is asymptotically equivalent to Marx's conditional bound on the decision complexity (JACM 2013), our $N^{\Theta(tw)}$ bound in the bounded-arity setting is tight, while the best conditional bound on the decision complexity is $N^{\Omega(tw/\log tw)}$. Note that, removing this logarithmic factor in the decision setting is a major open problem.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Algorithm for Hierarchical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of hierarchical queries is known to define the boundary of the dichotomy between tractability and intractability for the following two extensively studied problems about self-join free Boolean conjunctive queries (SJF-BCQ): (i) evaluating a SJF-BCQ on a tuple-independent probabilistic database; (ii) computing the Shapley value of a fact in a database on which a SJF-BCQ evaluates to true. Here, we establish that hierarchical queries define also the boundary of the dichotomy between tractability and intractability for a different natural algorithmic problem, which we call the "bag-set maximization" problem. The bag-set maximization problem associated with a SJF-BCQ $Q$ asks: given a database $\cal D$, find the biggest value that $Q$ takes under bag semantics on a database $\cal D'$ obtained from $\cal D$ by adding at most $\theta$ facts from another given database $\cal D^r$.
  For non-hierarchical queries, we show that the bag-set maximization problem is an NP-complete optimization problem. More significantly, for hierarchical queries, we show that all three aforementioned problems (probabilistic query evaluation, Shapley value computation, and bag-set maximization) admit a single unifying polynomial-time algorithm that operates on an abstract algebraic structure, called a "2-monoid". Each of the three problems requires a different instantiation of the 2-monoid tailored for the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Crash Frequency Modeling Based on Augmented Multi-Type Data by Hybrid VAE-Diffusion-Based Generative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crash frequency modelling analyzes the impact of factors like traffic volume, road geometry, and environmental conditions on crash occurrences. Inaccurate predictions can distort our understanding of these factors, leading to misguided policies and wasted resources, which jeopardize traffic safety. A key challenge in crash frequency modelling is the prevalence of excessive zero observations, caused by underreporting, the low probability of crashes, and high data collection costs. These zero observations often reduce model accuracy and introduce bias, complicating safety decision making. While existing approaches, such as statistical methods, data aggregation, and resampling, attempt to address this issue, they either rely on restrictive assumptions or result in significant information loss, distorting crash data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid VAE-Diffusion neural network, designed to reduce zero observations and handle the complexities of multi-type tabular crash data (count, ordinal, nominal, and real-valued variables). We assess the synthetic data quality generated by this model through metrics like similarity, accuracy, diversity, and structural consistency, and compare its predictive performance against traditional statistical models. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid VAE-Diffusion model outperforms baseline models across all metrics, offering a more effective approach to augmenting crash data and improving the accuracy of crash frequency predictions. This study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance traffic safety by improving crash frequency modelling and informing better policy decisions.</description>

      <title>MEBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Cross-Document Multi-Entity Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-entity question answering (MEQA) represents significant challenges for large language models (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which frequently struggle to consolidate scattered information across diverse documents. While existing methods excel at single-document comprehension, they often struggle with cross-document aggregation, particularly when resolving entity-dense questions like "What is the distribution of ACM Fellows among various fields of study?", which require integrating entity-centric insights from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Wikipedia pages). To address this gap, we introduce MEBench, a novel multi-document, multi-entity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capacity to retrieve, consolidate, and reason over fragmented information. Our benchmark comprises 4,780 questions which are systematically categorized into three primary categories, further divided into eight distinct types, ensuring broad coverage of real-world multi-entity reasoning scenarios. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3) and RAG pipelines reveal critical limitations: even advanced models achieve only 59% accuracy on MEBench. Our benchmark emphasizes the importance of completeness and factual precision of information extraction in MEQA tasks, using Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric for granular evaluation of entity-level correctness and attribution validity. MEBench not only highlights systemic weaknesses in current LLM frameworks but also provides a foundation for advancing robust, entity-aware QA architectures.</description>
