      <title>Social balance in directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks inherently exhibit complex relationships that can be positive or negative, as well as directional. Understanding balance in these networks is crucial for unraveling social dynamics, yet traditional theories struggle to incorporate directed interactions. This perspective presents a comprehensive roadmap for understanding balance in signed directed networks, extending traditional balance theory to account for directed interactions. Balance is indicated by the enrichment of higher-order patterns like triads compared to an adequate null model, where the network is randomized with some key aspects being preserved. Finding appropriate null models has been a challenging task even without considering directionality, which largely expands the space of potential null models. Recently, it has been shown that in the undirected case both the network topology and the signed degrees serve as key factors to preserve. Therefore, we introduce a maximally constrained null model that preserves the directed topology as well as node-level features given by the signed unidirectional, reciprocated, and conflicting node degrees. Our null model is based on the maximum-entropy principle and reveals consistent patterns across large-scale social networks. We also consider directed generalizations of balance theory and find that the observed patterns are well aligned with two proposed directed notions of strong balance. Our approach not only unveils balance in signed directed networks but can also serve as a starting point towards generative models of signed directed social networks, advancing our understanding of complex social systems and their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cities Reconceptualized: Unveiling Hidden Uniform Urban Shape through Commute Flow Modeling in Major US Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban development is shaped by historical, geographical, and economic factors, presenting challenges for planners in understanding urban form. This study models commute flows across multiple U.S. cities, uncovering consistent patterns in urban population distributions and commuting behaviors. By embedding urban locations to reflect mobility networks, we observe that population distributions across redefined urban spaces tend to approximate log-normal distributions, in contrast to the often irregular distributions found in geographical space. This divergence suggests that natural and historical constraints shape spatial population patterns, while, under ideal conditions, urban organization may naturally align with log-normal distribution. A theoretical model using preferential attachment and random walks supports the emergence of this distribution in urban settings. These findings reveal a fundamental organizing principle in urban systems that, while not always visible geographically, consistently governs population flows and distributions. This insight into the underlying urban structure can inform planners seeking to design efficient, resilient cities.</description>

      <title>Generating surrogate temporal networks from mesoscale building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate networks can constitute suitable replacements for real networks, in particular to study dynamical processes on networks, when only incomplete or limited datasets are available. As empirical datasets most often present complex features and interplays between structure and temporal evolution, creating surrogate data is however a challenging task, in particular for data describing time-resolved interactions between agents. Here we propose a method to generate surrogate temporal networks that mimic such observed datasets. The method is based on a decomposition of the original dataset into small temporal subnetworks encoding local structures on a short time scale. These are used as building blocks to generate a new synthetic temporal network that will hence inherit the shape of local interactions from the dataset. Moreover, we also take into account larger scale correlations on structural and temporal dimension, using them to inform the process of assembling the building blocks. We showcase the method by generating surrogate networks for several datasets of social interactions and comparing them to the original data on two complementary aspects. First, we show that the surrogate data possess complex structural and temporal features similar to the ones of the original data. Second, we simulate several dynamical processes, describing respectively epidemic spread, opinion formation and emergence of norms in a population, and compare the outcome of these processes on the generated and original datasets. We describe the method in detail and provide an implementation so that it can be easily used in future works based on temporally evolving networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise Interactions: Unveiling the Role of Higher-Order Interactions via Stepwise Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems, such as economic, social, biological, and ecological systems, usually feature interactions not only between pairwise entities but also among three or more entities. These multi-entity interactions are known as higher-order interactions. Hypergraph, as a mathematical tool, can effectively characterize higher-order interactions, where nodes denote entities and hyperedges represent interactions among multiple entities. Meanwhile, all higher-order interactions can also be projected into a number of lower-order interactions or even some pairwise interactions. Whether it is necessary to consider all higher-order interactions, and whether it is with little loss to replace them by lower-order or even pairwise interactions, remain a controversial issue. If the role of higher-order interactions is insignificant, the complexity of computation and the difficulty of analysis can be drastically reduced by projecting higher-order interactions into lower-order or pairwise interactions. We use link prediction, a fundamental problem in network science, as the entry point. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of higher-order interactions on link predictive accuracy to explore the necessity of these structures. We propose a method to decompose the higher-order structures in a stepwise way, thereby allowing to systematically explore the impacts of structures at different orders on link prediction. The results indicate that in some networks, incorporating higher-order interactions significantly enhances the accuracy of link prediction, while in others, the effect is insignificant. Therefore, we think that the role of higher-order interactions varies in different types of networks. Overall, since the improvement in predictive accuracy provided by higher-order interactions is significant in some networks, we believe that the study of higher-order interactions is both necessary and valuable.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in a three-strategy game combining snowdrift and stag hunt games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a three-strategy game that combines snowdrift and stag hunt games. This game is motivated by an experimental study, which found that individual solution lowers cooperation levels. Agents adopting this option aim to address a problem to the extent necessary to remove negative impact on themselves, although they do not free ride on cooperation effort provided by others. This property of the individual solution is similar to that of option defection in the stag hunt. Thus, the role of the interplay of defection in the snowdrift game and individual solution was examined in this study. The well-mixed population has two asymptotically stable rest points, one wherein the individual solution occupies the population, and the other wherein cooperation and defection coexist. The interactions on a square lattice enlarge the parameter region wherein cooperation survives, and the three strategies often coexist. The scrutinization of the evolutionary process shows that multiple mechanisms lead to the coexistence of the three strategies depending on parameter values. Our analysis suggests that considering the individual solution adds complexity to the evolutionary process, which might contribute to our understanding on the evolution of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Deliberation Among Informed Citizens: The Value of Exploring Alternative Thinking Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of deliberation to create consensus among fully-informed citizens. Our approach relies on two cognitive assumptions: i. citizens need a thinking frame (or perspective) to consider an issue; and ii. citizens cannot consider all relevant perspectives simultaneously: they are incompatible in the mind. These assumptions imply that opinions are intrinsically contextual. Formally, we capture contextuality in a simple quantum-like cognitive model. We consider a binary voting problem, in which two citizens with incompatible thinking frames and initially opposite voting intentions deliberate under the guidance of a benevolent facilitator. We find that when citizens consider alternative perspectives, their opinion may change. When the citizens' perspectives are two-dimensional and maximally uncorrelated, the probability for consensus after two rounds of deliberation reaches 75%; and this probability increases proportionally with the dimensionality (namely, the richness) of the perspectives. When dealing with a population of citizens, we also elaborate a novel rationale for working in subgroups. The contextuality approach delivers a number of insights. First, the diversity of perspectives is beneficial and even necessary for deliberations to overcome initial disagreement. Second, successful deliberation demand the active participation of citizens in terms of "putting themselves in the other's shoes". Third, well-designed procedures managed by a facilitator are necessary to secure increased probability for consensus. A last insight is that the richness of citizens' thinking frames is beneficial, while the optimal strategy entails focusing deliberation on a properly reduced problem.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Geometric Partition Entropy for the Estimation of Mutual Information in the Presence of Informative Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent introduction of geometric partition entropy brought a new viewpoint to non-parametric entropy quantification that incorporated the impacts of informative outliers, but its original formulation was limited to the context of a one-dimensional state space. A generalized definition of geometric partition entropy is now provided for samples within a bounded (finite measure) region of a d-dimensional vector space. The basic definition invokes the concept of a Voronoi diagram, but the computational complexity and reliability of Voronoi diagrams in high dimension make estimation by direct theoretical computation unreasonable. This leads to the development of approximation schemes that enable estimation that is faster than current methods by orders of magnitude. The partition intersection ($\pi$) approximation, in particular, enables direct estimates of marginal entropy in any context resulting in an efficient and versatile mutual information estimator. This new measure-based paradigm for data driven information theory allows flexibility in the incorporation of geometry to vary the representation of outlier impact, which leads to a significant broadening in the applicability of established entropy-based concepts. The incorporation of informative outliers is illustrated through analysis of transient dynamics in the synchronization of coupled chaotic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a case study of an application of high-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation to pandemic response planning on a university campus. In the summer of 2020, we were tasked with a COVID-19 pandemic response project to create a detailed behavioral simulation model of the entire campus population at Binghamton University. We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention. Moreover, systematic simulations with varying population density revealed that the effect of population density reduction was nonlinear, and that reducing the population density to 40-45% would be optimal and sufficient to suppress disease spreading on campus. These results were reported to the university administration and utilized in the pandemic response planning, which led to successful outcomes.</description>
