      <title>Field method approach in the factorization of nonlinear second order differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the general solution of second-order nonlinear differential equations of Lienard type is obtained within the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-Perez by the so-called field method approach. This method is based on writing the factorization conditions in the dynamical systems form and requires to assume that the intermediate function Phi that occurs in the factorization be dependent not only on the dependent variable of the nonlinear equation, but also on the independent variable. The method is applied to several cases of Lienard type equations which are written in a commutative factorization form and their general solutions are obtained by solving Bernoulli differential equations.</description>

      <title>Sharp restriction estimates for several degenerate higher co-dimensional quadratic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier restriction conjecture is an important problem in harmonic analysis. Guo-Oh [17] studied the restriction estimates for quadratic surfaces of co-dimension 2 in $\mathbb{R}^5$. For one special surface $(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3,\xi_1^2,\xi_2^2+\xi_1\xi_3)$, they applied a nested induction argument to build essentially sharp restriction estimate. In this paper, we simplify their method, and extend it to a variant of the broad-narrow analysis. As applications, we will prove essentially sharp restriction estimates for some kinds of degenerate higher co-dimensional quadratic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions of the fractional heat equation on Riemannian symmetric spaces of non-compact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the heat equation and the fractional heat equations on a Riemannian symmetric space of non-compact type. For $\alpha \in (0,1]$, let $h_t^\alpha$ denote the fractional heat kernel on a Riemannian symmetric space of non-compact type $X=G/K$ (see Section \ref{sef1}). We show that if $p \in [1,2]$ and $f \in L^1(X)$ is $K$-bi-invariant, then \[\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\|f\ast h_t^\alpha-\what f(i \gamma_p \rho)h_t^\alpha\|_p}{\|h_t^\alpha\|_p}=0,\] where $\gamma_p:=\frac 2p-1$, $\rho$ is the half sum of positive roots and $\what f(i \gamma_p \rho)$ denotes the spherical Fourier transform of $f $ at $i\gamma_p\rho$ (see Section \ref{prelim}). The above problems for symmetric spaces were studied recently by several authors for the case $p=1$ in some important cases \cite{Vaz-2, AE, Eff1, Eff2}. However, we believe that our study for the case $p \in (1,2]$ is new.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Bergman polynomials for domains with reflection-invariant corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the Bergman orthogonal polynomials $(p_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ for a class of bounded simply connected domains $D$. The class is defined by the requirement that conformal maps $\varphi$ of $D$ onto the unit disk extend analytically across the boundary $L$ of $D$, and that $\varphi'$ has a finite number of zeros $z_1,\ldots, z_q$ on $L$. The boundary $L$ is then piecewise analytic with corners at the zeros of $\varphi'$. A result of Stylianopoulos implies that a Carleman-type strong asymptotic formula for $p_n$ holds on the exterior domain $\mathbb{C}\setminus\overline{D}$. We prove that the same formula remains valid across $L\setminus\{z_1,\ldots,z_q\}$ and on a maximal open subset of $D$. As a consequence, the only boundary points that attract zeros of $p_n$ are the corners. This is in stark contrast to the case when $\varphi$ fails to admit an analytic extension past $L$, since when this happens the zero counting measure of $p_n$ is known to approach the equilibrium measure for $L$ along suitable subsequences.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation via Sawyer-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-variable extension of Rubio de Francia's restricted weak-type extrapolation theory that does not involve Rubio de Francia's iteration algorithm; instead, we rely on the following Sawyer-type inequality for the weighted Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $M_u$:
  $$ \left \Vert \frac{M_u (fv)}{v} \right \Vert_{L^{1,\infty}(uv)} \leq C_{u,v} \Vert f \Vert_{L^1(uv)}, \quad u, \, uv \in A_{\infty}. $$
  Our approach can be adapted to recover weak-type $A_{\vec P}$ extrapolation schemes, including an endpoint result that falls outside the classical theory.
  Among the applications of our work, we highlight extending outside the Banach range the well-known equivalence between restricted weak-type and weak-type for characteristic functions, and obtaining mixed and restricted weak-type bounds with $A_{p}^{\mathcal R}$ weights for relevant families of multi-variable operators, addressing the lack in the literature of these types of estimates. We also reveal several standalone properties of the class $A_{p}^{\mathcal R}$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Fourier Decay For Patterson-Sullivan Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Fourier transform of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to convex cocompact groups of isometries of real hyperbolic space decays polynomially quickly at infinity. The proof is based on the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in prior work of the author, combined with a method based on dynamical self-similarity for ruling out the sparse set of potential frequencies where the Fourier transform can be large.</description>

      <title>The metric for matrix degenerate Kato square root operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Kato square root estimate with anisotropically degenerate matrix coefficients. We do so by doing the harmonic analysis using an auxiliary Riemannian metric adapted to the operator. We also derive $L^2$-solvability estimates for boundary value problems for divergence form elliptic equations with matrix degenerate coefficients. Main tools are chain rules and Piola transformations for fields in matrix weighted $L^2$ spaces, under $W^{1,1}$ homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Probability Flow ODE for Score-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for sampling high-dimensional probability distributions. Despite their effectiveness, their theoretical underpinnings remain relatively underdeveloped. In this work, we study the convergence properties of deterministic samplers based on probability flow ODEs from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Assuming access to $L^2$-accurate estimates of the score function, we prove the total variation between the target and the generated data distributions can be bounded above by $\mathcal{O}(d\sqrt{\delta})$ in the continuous time level, where $d$ denotes the data dimension and $\delta$ represents the $L^2$-score matching error. For practical implementations using a $p$-th order Runge-Kutta integrator with step size $h$, we establish error bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d(\sqrt{\delta} + (dh)^p))$ at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical studies on problems up to $128$ dimensions to verify our theory, which indicate a better score matching error and dimension dependence.</description>

      <title>Rational approximation of Euler's constant using multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct new rational approximants to Euler's constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007) and Rivoal (2009). The approximants are given in terms of certain (mixed type) multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the exponential integral. The dual family of multiple orthogonal polynomials leads to new rational approximants of the Gompertz constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007). Our approach is motivated by the fact that we can reformulate Rivoal's construction in terms of type I multiple Laguerre polynomials of the first kind by making use of the underlying Riemann-Hilbert problem. As a consequence, we can drastically simplify Rivoal's approach, which allows us to study the Diophantine and asymptotic properties of the approximants more easily.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence of the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

      <title>A method for bounding oscillatory integrals in terms of non-oscillatory integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an elementary method for bounding a one-dimensional oscillatory integral in terms of an associated non-oscillatory integral. The bounds obtained are efficient in an appropriate sense and behave well under perturbations of the phase. As a consequence, for an $n$-dimensional oscillatory integral with a critical point at the origin, we may apply the one-dimensional estimates in the radial direction and then integrate the result, thereby obtaining natural bounds for the $n$-dimensional oscillatory integral in terms of the measures of the sublevel sets associated with the phase. To illustrate, we provide several classes of examples, including situations where the phase function has a critical point at which it vanishes to infinite order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed form solution for the one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a finite number of $\delta$-interactions \[ \mathbf{L}_{q,\mathfrak{I}_{N}}y:=-y^{\prime\prime}+\left( q(x)+\sum _{k=1}^{N}\alpha_{k}\delta(x-x_{k})\right) y=\lambda y,\quad0&lt;x&lt;b,\;\lambda \in\mathbb{C}% \] is presented in terms of the solution of the unperturbed equation \[ \mathbf{L}_{q}y:=-y^{\prime\prime}+q(x)y=\lambda y,\quad0&lt;x&lt;b,\;\lambda \in\mathbb{C}% \] and a corresponding transmutation operator $\mathbf{T}_{\mathfrak{I}_{N}}^{f}$ is obtained in the form of a Volterra integral operator. With the aid of the spectral parameter power series method, a practical construction of the image of the transmutation operator on a dense set is presented, and it is proved that the operator $\mathbf{T}_{\mathfrak{I}_{N}}^{f}$ transmutes the second derivative into the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $\mathbf{L}_{q,\mathfrak{I}_{N}}$ on a Sobolev space $H^{2}$. A Fourier-Legendre series representation for the integral transmutation kernel is developed, from which a new representation for the solutions and their derivatives, in the form of a Neumann series of Bessel functions, is derived.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with differential pencils possessing a term depending on the unknown function with a fixed argument. We deduce the so called main equation together with its fine structure for the spectral problem. Then, according to the boundary conditions and the position of argument, we describe two cases: degenerate and non-degenerate. For these two cases, the uniqueness of inverse spectral problem are studied and a constructive procedure for reconstructing the potentials along with necessary and sufficient conditions of its solvability are obtained.</description>

Abstract: In a recent work by Cruz-Uribe et al. was obtained that \[|\{x\in{\mathbb{R}^d}:w(x)|G(fw^{-1})(x)|&gt;\alpha\}|\lesssim\frac{[w]_{A_1}^2}{\alpha}\int_{{\mathbb{R}^d}}|f|dx\] both in the matrix and scalar settings, where $G$ is either the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function or any Calder\'on-Zygmund operator. In this note we show that the quadratic dependence on $[w]_{A_1}$ is sharp. This is done by constructing a sequence of scalar-valued weights with blowing up characteristics so that the corresponding bounds for the Hilbert transform and maximal function are exactly quadratic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a much shorter but even more powerful proof of an algebraic identity, which can be used to establish the direct and the converse inequality under Type IV superorthogonality. As an application, we obtain the optimal order of the formal constant in the direct inequality. This order turns out to be also sharp for Type III superorthogonality. When $p\geq 2$, our result recovers the optimal order of the constant in the Burkholder-Gundy inequality in martingale theory, and also recovers the currently best order of the constant in the reverse Littlewood-Paley inequality. We also introduce variants of Type IV superorthogonality, under which we prove the converse inequality.</description>
