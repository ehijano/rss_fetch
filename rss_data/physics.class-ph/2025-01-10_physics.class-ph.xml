      <title>Alternative writings of classical elastodynamics equations as a first order symmetric system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore alternative writings of the equations of classical elastodynamics as a first order symmetric system. In the one dimensional case we present symmetric writings with respect to: i) the velocity ($u_t$) and the displacement gradient ($u_x$), ii) the velocity and stress ($\sigma$), iii) all three quantities: the velocity, the displacement gradient and the stress, and finally iv) the momentum ($\rho_0 u_t$), the velocity, the displacement gradient and the stress. In the two dimensional case we present similar writings with respect to: i) the velocity (${\bf u}_t$) and the strain tensor ($\bf e$), ii) the velocity and the stress tensor ($\boldsymbol \sigma$), iii) all three variables $({\bf u}_t, {\bf e}, \boldsymbol \sigma)$, and finally iv) one more writing utilizing the momentum as well, i.e. $(\rho_0 {\bf u}_t, {\bf u}_t, {\bf e}, \boldsymbol \sigma)$. We accomplish our goal by judiciously using the compatibility equations as well as the momentum equation and the time differentiated constitutive law. This is done in an inverse way: we start by writing our initial equations as a first order system of the form ($\bf q$ being the vector representing the variables in each writing) $$
  A \frac{\partial {\bf q}}{\partial t}+\sum_{i=1}^n B_i \frac{\partial {\bf q}}{\partial x_i}=0, $$ with $n=1, 2$ depending on whether we are in 1 or 2 dimensions. We then check what are the symmetric forms of matrices $B_i$ and which combinations of the compatibility equations, the momentum equations and the time differentiated constitutive law should be used in order the symmetric form of matrices $B_i$ to appear into the system. This "symmetrization" process alters matrix $A$ and if the resulting matrix $A$ is symmetric our goal is accomplished. Our analysis is confined to classical elastodynamics, namely geometrically and materially linear anisotropic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Driven damped harmonic oscillator revisited: energy resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the exact expression for the resonant frequency of the time-averaged steady-state energy and show that this frequency is excellently approximated by the arithmetic mean of the amplitude and velocity resonant frequencies. In addition, we argue that the frequency of the amplitude resonance can be regarded as the energy resonance frequency, since it provides the maximal peak values of instantaneous energy.</description>

      <title>Material instability and subsequent restabilization from homogenization of periodic elastic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two classes of non-linear elastic materials are derived via two-dimensional homogenization. These materials are equivalent to a periodic grid of axially-deformable and axially-preloaded structural elements, subject to incremental deformations that involve bending, shear, and normal forces. The unit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are lumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other class involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with sufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the elasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and subsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions, this loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is, the material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness domain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable state. This effect is closely related to the axial compliance of the elements. Our results: (i.) demonstrate new possibilities for exploiting structural elements within the elastic range, characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom, to create architected materials with tuneable instabilities, (ii.) introduce reconfigurable materials characterized by 'islands' of stability or instability.</description>
