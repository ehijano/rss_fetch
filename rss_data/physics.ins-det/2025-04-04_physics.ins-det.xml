      <title>MATHUSLA: An External Long-Lived Particle Detector to Maximize the Discovery Potential of the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the current status of the MATHUSLA (MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra-Stable neutraL pArticles) long-lived particle (LLP) detector at the HL-LHC, covering the design, fabrication and installation at CERN Point 5. MATHUSLA40 is a 40 m-scale detector with an air-filled decay volume that is instrumented with scintillator tracking detectors, to be located near CMS. Its large size, close proximity to the CMS interaction point and about 100 m of rock shielding from LHC backgrounds allows it to detect LLP production rates and lifetimes that are one to two orders of magnitude beyond the ultimate reach of the LHC main detectors. This provides unique sensitivity to many LLP signals that are highly theoretically motivated, due to their connection to the hierarchy problem, the nature of dark matter, and baryogenesis. Data taking is projected to commence with the start of HL-LHC operations. We summarize the new 40m design for the detector that was recently presented in the MATHUSLA Conceptual Design Report, alongside new realistic background and signal simulations that demonstrate high efficiency for the main target LLP signals in a background-free HL-LHC search. We argue that MATHUSLA's uniquely robust expansion of the HL-LHC physics reach is a crucial ingredient in CERN's mission to search for new physics and characterize the Higgs boson with precision.</description>

      <title>The Calibr-A-Ton: a novel method for calorimeter energy calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy calibration of calorimeters at collider experiments, such as the ones at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, is crucial for achieving the experiment's physics objectives. Standard calibration approaches have limitations which become more pronounced as detector granularity increases. In this paper we propose a novel calibration procedure to simultaneously calibrate individual detector cells belonging to a particle shower, by targeting a well-controlled energy reference. The method bypasses some of the difficulties that exist in more standard approaches. It is implemented using differentiable programming. In this paper, simulated energy deposits in the electromagnetic section of a high-granularity calorimeter are used to study the method and demonstrate its performance. It is shown that the method is able to correct for biases in the energy response.</description>

      <title>Orbit Determination through Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the use of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation as a reference signal for Initial Orbit Determination (IOD). By leveraging the unique properties of CMB, this study introduces a novel method for estimating spacecraft velocity and position with minimal reliance on pre-existing environmental data, offering significant advantages for space missions independent of Earth-specific conditions. Using Machine Learning (ML) regression models, this approach demonstrates the capability to determine velocity from CMB signals and subsequently determine the satellite's position. The results indicate that CMB has the potential to enhance the autonomy and flexibility of spacecraft operations.</description>

      <title>Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate an irradiated NbN SNSPD exhibiting a well-defined saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by irradiation-induced modifications and an avalanche-assisted detection mechanism with weak wavelength dependence. Our findings provide valuable insights into ion irradiation as a post-processing technique for SNSPDs, offering a pathway to enhancing IDE and tailoring thermal properties. This work also advances the understanding of SNSPD physics and defect engineering in superconducting thin films, expanding the potential applications of irradiation techniques in superconducting optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Time resolution limits in silicon sensors from Landau fluctuations and electronics noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we derive analytical expressions for the time resolution limits of standard silicon sensors, LGADs, and 3D trench sensors. We separately examine the effects of Landau fluctuations and electronic noise. To analyze Landau fluctuations, we relate the time resolution of a single electron-hole pair generated at a random position in the sensor to the time resolution associated with the full ionization pattern produced by a charged particle. For electronic noise, we explore optimal filtering techniques that minimize its impact on time resolution, and evaluate how closely these can be approximated by practical filters. Finally, we demonstrate that the combined effect of Landau fluctuations and electronic noise cannot, in general, be simply expressed as the quadratic sum of the individual contributions.</description>

      <title>Technical Overview of Recent Developments in Small Modular Reactors in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small modular reactors (SMRs) are a class of advanced nuclear fission reactors characterized by their compact core size (typically &lt;300 MWe) and passive safety systems. Their modular design enables on-site assembly, making them suitable for deployment in locations inaccessible to conventional large-scale reactors. With rising global energy demand, particularly driven by the growth of AI, SMRs have recently gained attention as a potential solution for powering data centers. This technical review aims to provide the public and relevant stakeholders with a foundational understanding of SMR technology. It begins with an overview of SMR concepts, historical context, and their current role in the U.S. energy mix. Detailed technical summaries of nine selected SMR designs are then presented, covering core design, fuel systems, reactivity control, and safety features. The report also outlines key regulatory frameworks, including 10 CFR Part 50, Part 52, and the technology-inclusive, risk-informed, and performance-based framework currently under development. Finally, major U.S. programs and legislative efforts supporting SMR deployment over the past decade are summarized.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of proton irradiation-induced defects on the electrical performance of 4H-SiC PIN detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) demonstrates significant potential for high-energy particle detection in complex radiation environments due to its exceptional radiation resistance, excellent environmental adaptability, and fast response time. Compared to silicon (Si) detectors, SiC detectors exhibit distinct radiation resistance characteristics depending on the type of radiation exposure. Here, the mechanism of the impact of 80MeV proton irradiation on the electrical performance of 4H-SiC PIN devices is reported.Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) were utilized to analyze the defect characteristics and minority carrier lifetime of 4H-SiC detectors before and after irradiation, respectively. A Deep-Level Compensation Model (DLCM) was established using open source TCAD simulation tools RAdiation SEmiconductoR (RASER) to investigate mechanism responsible for the decrease in leakage current with rising radiation intensity, as well as the constant-capacitance behavior exhibited under proton irradiation up to $7.8\times10^{14} n_{eq}/cm^2$. The establishment of the physical model opens the door for the study of the influence mechanism of irradiation defects on SiC particle detectors.</description>

      <title>Characterization of more than three years of in-orbit radiation damage of SiPMs on GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are prone to radiation damage which causes an increase of dark count rate. This leads to an increase in low-energy threshold in a gamma-ray detector combining SiPM and a scintillator. Despite this drawback, they are becoming preferred for scintillator-based gamma-ray detectors on CubeSats due to their low operation voltage, small size, linear response to low light intensity and fast response. This increasing popularity of SiPMs among new spaceborne missions makes it important to characterize their long-term performance in the space environment. In this work, we report the change of the dark count rate and low-energy threshold of S13360-3050 PE multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs) by Hamamatsu, using measurements acquired by the GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats at low Earth orbit (LEO) spanning over three years. Such a long measurement of the performance of MPPCs in space has not been published before. GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched on March 22, 2021, to a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous polar orbit (SSO) carrying on board a gamma-ray detector based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by eight MPPCs and regularly detecting gamma-ray transients such as gamma-ray bursts and solar flares in the energy range of ~30-900 keV. VZLUSAT-2 is a 3U CubeSat launched on January 13, 2022 also to a 535 km altitude SSO carrying on board, among other payloads, two gamma-ray detectors similar to the one on GRBAlpha. We have flight-proven the Hamamatsu MPPCs S13360-3050 PE and demonstrated that MPPCs, shielded by 2.5 mm of PbSb alloy, can be used in LEO environment on a scientific mission lasting beyond three years. This manifests the potential of MPPCs being employed in future satellites.</description>

      <title>Mechanical strength investigations of the APPLE-X undulator using Fiber Bragg Grating strain measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SPARC_LAB facility at the INFN LNF is being upgraded to accommodate a new user facility as part of the SABINA project. It was set up to investigate the feasibility of an ultra-brilliant photoinjector and to perform FEL experiments. The new beamline is equipped with three APPLE-X undulators acting as amplifiers to deliver IR/THz radiation with photon pulses in the ps range, with energy of tens of uJ, and with linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. The APPLE-X guarantees to vary the gap amplitude between the magnets arrays and their relative phase. The entire system has been designed from scratch, and a structural analysis has been carried out. Once they were in Frascati, in collaboration with ENEA, a further investigation campaign was launched on the mechanical, using strain measurements based on optical methods. FBG sensors were suitable for these tests due to their immunity to electromagnetic noise. They consist of a phase grating inscribed in the core of a single-mode fiber, whose Bragg-diffracted light propagates back along the fiber. If bonded to the mechanical structure, they can be used as strain sensors. By following the variations in the scattered spectrum, it is possible to perform strain measurements. Using multiple FBGs applied at selected locations on the undulator, several measurements were while opening and closing the gap or changing the phase, but also by studying the quiescent response as a function of the ambient temperature. The results of these tests show that there is a clear deformation of the structure related to the temperature changes and magnetic forces, but the magnitude of this deformation is well within the tolerances required for the functionality of the undulator since they are compatible or lower with respect to the one calculated with the finite elements methods. The tests confirm the reliability of the mechanical structure.</description>

      <title>Classification of Electron and Muon Neutrino Events for the ESS$\nu$SB Near Water Cherenkov Detector using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15247v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the effort to obtain a precise measurement of leptonic CP-violation with the ESS$\nu$SB experiment, accurate and fast reconstruction of detector events plays a pivotal role. In this work, we examine the possibility of replacing the currently proposed likelihood-based reconstruction method with an approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). As the likelihood-based reconstruction method is reasonably accurate but computationally expensive, one of the benefits of a Machine Learning (ML) based method is enabling fast event reconstruction in the detector development phase, allowing for easier investigation of the effects of changes to the detector design. Focusing on classification of flavour and interaction type in muon and electron events and muon- and electron neutrino interaction events, we demonstrate that the GNN reconstructs events with greater accuracy than the likelihood method for events with greater complexity, and with increased speed for all events. Additionally, we investigate the key factors impacting reconstruction performance, and demonstrate how separation of events by pion production using another GNN classifier can benefit flavour classification.</description>
