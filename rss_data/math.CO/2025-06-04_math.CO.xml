      <title>2-Homogeneous bipartite distance-regular graphs and the quantum group $U^\prime_q(\mathfrak{so}_6)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a 2-homogeneous bipartite distance-regular graph $\Gamma$ with diameter $D \geq 3$. We assume that $\Gamma$ is not a hypercube nor a cycle. We fix a $Q$-polynomial ordering of the primitive idempotents of $\Gamma$. This $Q$-polynomial ordering is described using a nonzero parameter $q \in \mathbb C$ that is not a root of unity. We investigate $\Gamma$ using an $S_3$-symmetric approach. In this approach one considers $V^{\otimes 3} = V \otimes V \otimes V$ where $V$ is the standard module of $\Gamma$. We construct a subspace $\Lambda$ of $V^{\otimes 3}$ that has dimension $\binom{D+3}{3}$, together with six linear maps from $\Lambda$ to $\Lambda$. Using these maps we turn $\Lambda$ into an irreducible module for the nonstandard quantum group
  $U^\prime_q(\mathfrak{so}_6)$ introduced by Gavrilik and Klimyk in 1991.</description>

      <title>Isotopisms of quadratic quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasigroup is a pair $(Q, \cdot)$ where $Q$ is a non-empty set and $\cdot$ is a binary operation on $Q$ such that for every $(u, v) \in Q^2$ there exists a unique $(x, y) \in Q^2$ such that $u \cdot x = v = y \cdot u$. Let $q$ be an odd prime power, let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote the finite field of order $q$, and let $\mathcal{R}_q$ denote the set of non-zero squares in $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $\{a, b\} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ be such that $\{ab, (a-1)(b-1)\} \subseteq \mathcal{R}_q$. Let $\mathcal{Q}_{a, b}$ denote the quadratic quasigroup $(\mathbb{F}_q, *_{a, b})$ where $*_{a, b}$ is defined by
  \[ \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  x+a(y-x) &amp; \text{if } y-x \in \mathcal{R}_q,\\ x+b(y-x) &amp; \text{otherwise}.
  \end{array}
  \right. \] The operation table of a quadratic quasigroup is a quadratic Latin square. Recently, it has been determined exactly when two quadratic quasigroups are isomorphic and the automorphism group of any quadratic quasigroup has been determined. In this paper, we extend these results. We determine exactly when two quadratic quasigroups are isotopic and we determine the autotopism group of any quadratic quasigroup. In the process, we count the number of $2 \times 2$ subsquares in quadratic Latin squares.</description>

      <title>Perfect $1$-factorisations of $K_{11,11}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect $1$-factorisation of a graph is a decomposition of that graph into $1$-factors such that the union of any two $1$-factors is a Hamiltonian cycle. A Latin square of order $n$ is row-Hamiltonian if for every pair $(r,s)$ of distinct rows, the permutation mapping $r$ to $s$ has a single cycle of length $n$. We report the results of a computer enumeration of the perfect $1$-factorisations of the complete bipartite graph $K_{11,11}$. This also allows us to find all row-Hamiltonian Latin squares of order $11$. Finally, we plug a gap in the literature regarding how many row-Hamiltonian Latin squares are associated with the classical families of perfect $1$-factorisations of complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Extendability of the $B_2$-arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathscr{A},m)$ be a free multiarrangement, and let $\mathscr{E}$ be an extension of $(\mathscr{A},m)$. It is well known that if $\mathscr{A}$ is the Coxeter arrangement of type $A_2$, then a free extension of $(\mathscr{A},m)$ always exists. In this work, we demonstrate that if $\mathscr{A}$ is the Coxeter arrangement of type $B_2$, there exist infinitely many multiplicities for which no free extension of $(\mathscr{A},m)$ exists. This result has immediate consequences for the existence of free extensions in higher rank.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular and strongly walk-regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study perfect state transfer in Grover walks on two important classes of graphs: strongly regular graphs and strongly walk-regular graphs. The latter class is a generalization of the former. We first give a complete classification of strongly regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer. The only such graphs are the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,2}$ and the complete tripartite graph $K_{2,2,2}$. We then show that, if a genuine strongly walk-regular graph admits perfect state transfer, then its spectrum must be of the form $\{[k]^1, [\frac{k}{2}]^{\alpha}, [0]^{\beta}, [-\frac{k}{2}]^{\gamma}\}$, and we enumerate all feasible spectra of this form up to $k=20$ with the help of a computer. These results are obtained using techniques from algebraic number theory and spectral graph theory, particularly through the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenprojections of a normalized adjacency matrix. While the setting is in quantum walks, the core discussion is developed entirely within the framework of spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Not every graph can be reconstructed from its boundary distance matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a connected graph $G$ is said to be a boundary vertex of $G$ if for some other vertex $u$ of $G$, no neighbor of $v$ is further away from $u$ than $v$. The boundary $\partial(G)$ of $G$ is the set of all of its boundary vertices.
  The boundary distance matrix $\hat{D}_G$ of a graph $G=([n],E)$ is the square matrix of order $\kappa$, being $\kappa$ the order of $\partial(G)$, such that for every $i,j\in \partial(G)$, $[\hat{D}_G]_{ij}=d_G(i,j)$.
  In a recent paper [doi.org/10.7151/dmgt.2567], it was shown that if a graph $G$ is either a block graph or a unicyclic graph, then $G$ is uniquely determined by the boundary distance matrix $\hat{D}_{G}$ of $G$, and it was also conjectured that this statement holds for every connected graph $G$, whenever both the order $n$ and the boundary (and thus also the boundary distance matrix) of $G$ are prefixed.
  After proving that this conjecture is true for several graph families, such as being of diameter 2, having order at most $n=6$ or being Ptolemaic, we show that this statement does not hold when considering, for example, either the family of split graphs of diameter 3 and order at least $n=10$ or the family of distance-hereditary graphs of order at least $n=8$.</description>

      <title>A Fan-type condition involving bipartite independence number for hamiltonicity in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02687v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bipartite independence number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$, is defined as the smallest integer $q$ for which there exist positive integers $s$ and $t$ satisfying $s + t = q + 1$, such that for any two disjoint subsets $A, B \subseteq V(G)$ with $|A| = s$ and $|B| = t$, there exists an edge between $A$ and $B$. In this paper, we prove that for a $2$-connected graph $G$ of order at least three, if $\max\{d_G(x),d_G(y)\}\geq \widetilde{\alpha}(G)$ for any pair of nonadjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $G$ at distance 2, then $G$ is hamiltonian. In addition, we prove that for a $3$-connected graph $G$, if $\max\{d_G(x),d_G(y)\}\geq \widetilde{\alpha}(G)+1$ for any pair of nonadjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $G$ at distance 2, then $G$ is hamiltonian-connected. Our results generalize the work of Li and Liu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kamaldinov, Skorkin, and Zhukovskii proved that the maximum size of an induced subtree in the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ is concentrated at two consecutive points, whenever $p\in(0,1)$ is a constant. Using improved bounds on the second moment of the number of induced subtrees, we show that the same result holds when $n^{-\frac{e-2}{3e-2}+\varepsilon}\leq p=o(1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-divisor graphs of commutative rings are well-represented in the literature. In this paper, we consider dominating sets, total dominating sets, domination numbers and total domination numbers of zero-divisor graphs. We determine the domination and total domination numbers of zero-divisor graphs are equal for all zero-divisor graphs of commutative rings except for $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times D$ in which $D$ is a domain. In this case, $\gamma(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times D)) = 1$ and $\gamma_t(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times D)) = 2$.</description>

      <title>On 102-avoiding inversion sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a bijection between the set of inversion sequences avoiding the pattern 102 and the set of 2-Schr\"{o}der paths having neither peaks nor valleys and ending with a diagonal step. To achieve this, we introduce two intermediate objects, called UVD paths and labeled $F$-paths, and establish bijections among all four families. For each of these combinatorial objects, we define a natural statistic and enumerate the corresponding structures with respect to this statistic. In addition, we study inversion sequences avoiding 102 and another pattern of length 3, providing refined enumerations according to the same statistic.</description>

      <title>Period matrices and homological quasi-trees on discrete Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete period matrices associated with graphs cellularly embedded on closed surfaces, resembling classical period matrices of Riemann surfaces. Defined via integrals of discrete harmonic 1-forms, these period matrices are known to encode discrete conformal structure in the sense of circle patterns. We obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete period matrix, where its minors correspond to weighted sums over certain spanning subgraphs, which we call homological quasi-trees. Furthermore, we relate the period matrix to the determinant of the Laplacian for a flat complex line bundle. We derive a combinatorial analogue of the Weil-Petersson potential on Teichm\"uller space, expressed as a weighted sum over homological quasi-trees. Finally, we prove that the collection of homological quasi-trees form a delta-matroid. The discrete period matrix plays a role similar to that of the response matrix in circular planar networks, thereby addressing a question posed by Richard Kenyon.</description>

      <title>Khintchine inequalities, trace monoids and Tur\'an-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove scalar and operator-valued Khintchine inequalities for mixtures of free and tensor-independent semicircle variables, interpolating between classical and free Khintchine-type inequalities. Specifically, we characterize the norm of sums of $G$-independent semicircle variables in terms of the spectral radius of the Cayley graph associated with the trace monoid determined by the graph $G$. Our approach relies on a precise correspondence between closed paths in trace monoids and the norms of such operator sums. This correspondence uncovers connections between non-commutative probability, combinatorial group theory, and extremal graph theory. In particular, we formulate Tur\'an-type extremal problems that govern maximal norm growth under classical commutation constraints, and identify the extremal configurations. We hope that the methods and connections developed here will be useful in the study of non-commutative structures constrained by combinatorial symmetries.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz morphisms on singular cohomology and local cohomological dimension of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a proper toric variety and a line bundle on it, we describe the morphism on singular cohomology given by the cup product with the Chern class of that line bundle in terms of the data of the associated fan. Using that, we relate the local cohomological dimension of an affine toric variety with the Lefschetz morphism on the singular cohomology of a projective toric variety of one dimension lower. As a corollary, we show that the local cohomological defect is not a combinatorial invariant. We also produce numerous examples of toric varieties in every dimension with any possible local cohomological defect, by showing that the local cohomological defect remains unchanged under taking a pyramid.</description>

Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that the vertices of every strongly $c \cdot kt$-connected tournament can be partitioned into $t$ parts, each of which induces a strongly $k$-connected tournament. This is clearly tight up to a constant factor, and it confirms a conjecture of K\"uhn, Osthus and Townsend (2016).</description>

      <title>1-planar unit distance graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matchstick graph is a plane graph with edges drawn as unit distance line segments. This class of graphs was introduced by Harborth who conjectured that a matchstick graph on $n$ vertices can have at most $\lfloor 3n - \sqrt{12n - 3}\rfloor$ edges. Recently, his conjecture was settled by Lavoll\'ee and Swanepoel. In this paper we consider $1$-planar unit distance graphs. We say that a graph is a $1$-planar unit distance graph if it can be drawn in the plane such that all edges are drawn as unit distance line segments while each of them are involved in at most one crossing. We show that such graphs on $n$ vertices can have at most $3n-\sqrt[4]{n}/15$ edges, which is almost tight. We also investigate some generalizations, namely $k$-planar and $k$-quasiplanar unit distance graphs.</description>

      <title>The clique chromatic number of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>Independent Sets in Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Shearer states that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph of maximum degree $d \geq 2$ contains an independent set of size at least $(d\log d - d + 1)/(d - 1)^2 \cdot n$. Ajtai, Koml\'{o}s, Pintz, Spencer and Szemer\'{e}di proved that every $(r + 1)$-uniform $n$-vertex ``uncrowded'' hypergraph of maximum degree $d \geq 1$ has an independent set of size at least $c_r(\log d)^{1/r}/d^{1/r} \cdot n$ for some $c_r &gt; 0$ depending only on $r$. Shearer asked whether his method for triangle-free graphs could be extended to uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we answer this in the affirmative, thereby giving a short proof of the theorem of Ajtai, Koml\'{o}s, Pintz, Spencer and Szemer\'{e}di for a wider class of ``locally sparse'' hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting the number of spanning trees in specific classes of graphs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this note, we present unified proofs and generalizations of several results obtained in the 2020s. The main method is to study the behavior of the vertex (degree) enumerator of a distance-hereditary graph under the operations of copying vertices.
  Ehrenborg conjecture says that a Ferrer--Young graph maximizes the number of spanning trees among bipartite graphs with the same degree sequence. The second result of this paper is the equivalence of the Ehrenborg conjecture and its polynomial form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interior polynomial was originally defined for hypergraphs and later shown to coincide with the Ehrhart polynomial of the root polytope of an associated bipartite graph. In previous work, we derived an alternating cycle recursion formula for the interior polynomial. Here, we introduce a new, more transparent recursion formula based on the structure of non-expanding sets. This formula offers a clearer combinatorial interpretation of the interior polynomial and its connection to polyhedral geometry.</description>

      <title>On Distinguishing Graphs and Cost Number using Automorphism Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distinguishing coloring of a graph is a vertex coloring such that only the identity automorphism of the graph preserves the coloring. A 2-distinguishable graph is a graph which can be distinguished using 2 colors. The cost $\rho(G)$ of a 2-distinguishable graph is the smallest size of a color set of a distinguishing coloring of $G$. The determining number of a graph, $Det(G)$, is the minimum number of nodes, which if fixed by a coloring, would ensure that the coloring distinguishes the entire graph.
  Boutin (J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 85: 161-171, 2013) posed an open problem which asks if $\rho(G)$ and $Det(G)$ can be arbitrarily far apart. It is trivial that it cannot be so for the case $Det(G) = 1$ but the answer was unknown for $Det(G) \geq 2$. We solve this problem for the case $Det(G) = 2$. We show that for the case $Det(G) = 2$, that not only is the cost bounded but in fact it takes small values with $\rho(G) = 2, \ 3$ or $4$. In order to establish this, the concept of the automorphism representation of a graph is developed. Graphs having equivalent automorphism representations implies that they have the same distinguishing number (note that just having isomorphic automorphism groups is not enough for this to hold). This prompts a factoring of graphs by which two graphs are distinguishably equivalent iff they have equivalent automorphism representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number is the smallest $t$ so that from any initial configuration of $t$ pebbles it is possible, after a sequence of pebbling moves, to place a pebble on any given target vertex. Graphs whose pebbling number is equal to the number of vertices are called Class~$0$ and provide a challenging set of graphs that resist being characterized. In this note, we answer a question recently proposed by the pioneering study on the pebbling number of snark graphs: we prove that the smallest Flower snark $J_3$ is Class~$0$, establishing that $J_3$ is in fact the only Class~$0$ Flower snark.</description>

      <title>Mutual-visibility of the disjointness graph of segments in ${\mathbb R}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a simple graph, and let $U\subseteq V(G)$. Two distinct vertices $x,y\in U$ are $U$-mutually visible if $G$ contains a shortest $x$-$y$ path that is internally disjoint from $U$. $U$ is called a mutual-visibility set of $G$ if any two vertices of $U$ are $U$-mutually visible. The mutual-visibility number $\mu(G)$ of $G$ is the size of a largest mutual-visibility set of $G$. Let $P$ be a set of $n\geq 3$ points in ${\mathbb R}^2$ in general position. The disjointness graph of segments $D(P)$ of $P$ is the graph whose vertices are all the closed straight line segments with endpoints in $P$, two of which are adjacent in $D(P)$ if and only if they are disjoint. In this paper we establish tight lower and upper bounds for $\mu(D(P))$, and show that almost all edge disjointness graphs have diameter 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce twisted triple crossing diagram maps, collections of points in projective space associated to bipartite graphs on the cylinder, and use them to provide geometric realizations of the cluster integrable systems of Goncharov and Kenyon constructed from toric dimer models. Using this notion, we provide geometric proofs that the pentagram map and the cross-ratio dynamics integrable systems are cluster integrable systems. We show that in appropriate coordinates, cross-ratio dynamics is described by geometric $R$-matrices, which solves the open question of finding a cluster algebra structure describing cross-ratio dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Pansiot's work on substitutions, we prove a similar theorem for automorphisms of a free group F of finite rank: if a right-infinite word X represents an attracting fixed point of an automorphism of F, the subword complexity of X is equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2. The proof uses combinatorial arguments analogue to Pansiot's as well as train tracks. We also define the recurrence complexity of X, and we apply it to laminations. In particular, we show that attracting laminations have complexity equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2 (to n if the automorphism is fully irreducible).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph on the vertex set $V(G)$ and let $r$ be a positive integer. We consider the hypergraph $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$ whose vertices are the vertices of $G$ and the (hyper)edges are all $A\subseteq V(G)$ such that $|A|=r+1$ and the induced subgraph $G[A]$ is connected. The (hyper)edge ideal $I_r(G)$ of $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$ is also the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a generalisation of the independence complex of $G$, called the $r$-independence complex $\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$. In this article we make extensive use of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to find the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G_1*G_2)$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G_1)$ and $I_r(G_2)$, where $G_1*G_2$ is the join of $G_1$ and $G_2$. Moreover, we find formulas for all the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G)$, when $G$ is a complete graph, complete multipartite graph, cycle graph and the wheel graph.</description>

      <title>Cohomological VC-density: Bounds and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) density is pivotal across various mathematical fields, including discrete geometry, probability theory and model theory. In this paper, we introduce a topological generalization of VC-density. Let $Y$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{X}$ a family of closed subspaces of $Y$. For each $p \geq 0$, we define a number, $\mathrm{vcd}^{p}_{\mathcal{X}}$, which we refer to as the degree $p$ VC-density of the family $\mathcal{X}$. The classical notion of VC-density within this topological framework can be recovered by setting $p=0$.
  Our definition of degree $p$ VC-density extends to higher orders as well. For $p \geq 0$, $q \geq 1$, we define the degree $p$, order $q$ VC density $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}}$ of $\mathcal{X}$, which recovers Shelah's notion of higher order VC-density for $q$-dependent families when $p=0$. Our definition introduces a completely new notion when $p &gt; 0$.
  We examine the properties of $\mathrm{vcd}_{\mathcal{X}}^p$ (as well as $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}}$) when the families $\mathcal{X}$ are definable in structures with some underlying topology (for instance, the Euclidean topology for o-minimal structures over $\mathbb{R}$, the analytic topology over $\mathbb{C}$, or the \'{e}tale site for schemes over arbitrary algebraically closed fields). Our main result establishes that in any model of these theories
  \[ \mathrm{vcd}_{\mathcal{X}}^p \leq (p+1) \dim X, \] and more generally for any $q \geq 1$ \[ \mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}} \leq (p+q) \dim X. \] We give examples to show that our bounds are optimal. We also present combinatorial applications of our higher-degree VC-density bounds, deriving higher degree topological analogs of well-known results such as the existence of $\varepsilon$-nets and the fractional Helly theorem.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories--refined by rigidity invariance--and shows that under general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories--these posets are lattices. Based on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.
  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
