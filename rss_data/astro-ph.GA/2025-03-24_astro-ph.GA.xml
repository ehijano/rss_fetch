      <title>JWST's little red dots: an emerging population of young, low-mass AGN cocooned in dense ionized gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>A "Black Hole Star" Reveals the Remarkable Gas-Enshrouded Hearts of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical processes that led to the formation of billion solar mass black holes within the first 700 million years of cosmic time remain a puzzle. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a "black hole star" (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free "atmosphere" around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super-Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.</description>

      <title>A remarkable Ruby: Absorption in dense gas, rather than evolved stars, drives the extreme Balmer break of a Little Red Dot at $z=3.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$\alpha\ \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M_\odot,\ r_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$\alpha$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.</description>

      <title>Predictions for Detecting a Turndown in the Baryonic Tully Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryonic Tully Fisher relation (bTFR) provides an empirical connection between baryonic mass and dynamical mass (measured by the maximum rotation velocity) for galaxies. Due to the impact of baryonic feedback in the shallower potential wells of dwarf galaxies, the bTFR is predicted to turn down at low masses from the extrapolated power-law relation at high masses. The low-mass end of the bTFR is poorly constrained due to small samples and difficulty in connecting the galaxy's gas kinematics to its dark matter halo. Simulations can help us understand this connection and interpret observations. We measure the bTFR with 66 dwarf galaxies from the Marvel-ous and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our sample has M$_\star = 10^6-10^9$ M$_\odot$, and is mostly gas dominated. We compare five velocity methods: V$_\text{out,circ}$ (spatially resolved mass-enclosed), V$_\text{out,mid}$ (spatially resolved midplane gravitational potential), and unresolved HI linewidths at different percentages of the peak flux (W$_\text{10}$, W$_\text{20}$, and W$_\text{50}$). We find an intrinsic turndown in the bTFR for maximum halo speeds $\lesssim 50$ km s$^{-1}$ (or total baryonic mass, M$_\text{bary}\lesssim 10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$). We find that observing HI in lower-mass galaxies to the conventional surface density limit of 1M$_\odot$pc$^{-2}$ is not enough to detect a turndown in the bTFR; none of the HI velocity methods (spatially resolved or unresolved) recover the turndown, and we find bTFR slopes consistent with observations of higher-mass galaxies. However, we predict that the turndown can be recovered by resolved rotation curves if the HI limit is $\lesssim 0.08$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, which is within the sensitivity of current HI surveys like FEASTS and MHONGOOSE.</description>

      <title>First Measurements of Black Hole Accretion and Radio-jet Timescales in a Young Quasar at the Edge of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first study dedicated to measuring the timescales for black hole accretion and jet launch in a quasar at the edge of Reionization, PSO J352.4034-15.3373 at z = 5.832 $\pm$ 0.001. Previous work presented evidence of the strong radio synchrotron emission from the jet affecting the host galaxy dust-dominated continuum emission at $\nu_{\rm rest}=683$ GHz ($\nu_{\rm obs}=100$ GHz), implying a break in the synchrotron spectrum. In this work, we present quasi-simultaneous observations at 1.5\, GHz - 42\,GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and derive a frequency break at $\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm rest} = 196.46$ GHz ($\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm obs} = 28.76$ GHz). Modeling these observations, we calculate the jet spectral aging from the cooling of electrons to be $t_{\mathrm{spec}}\sim 580$ yr. From this measurement, we approximate the dynamical age $t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ to be $\sim2,000$ yr, implying a recent jet ejection. We compare the jet timescale to the quasar's lifetime ($t_{\mathrm{Q}}$) that indicates the duration of the latest black hole accretion event and is derived from the proximity zone size in the rest-UV/optical spectrum. However, a ghostly Damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system affects this measurement yielding an upper limit of $t_{\mathrm{Q}} \lesssim 10^4$ yr, consistent with the jet lifetime and indicative of a young quasar. This suggests that the triggering of a UV-bright quasar phase may occur within comparable timescales as the launch of a relativistic radio jet. Therefore, we may be witnessing an early stage of black hole and jet interactions in a quasar during the first gigayear of the universe.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Star clusters in IC 342, NGC 2403, and Holmberg II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the star cluster populations in the three nearby galaxies IC 342, NGC 2403, and Holmberg II, observed as part of the Euclid Early Release Observations programme. Our main focus is on old globular clusters (GCs), for which the wide field-of-view and excellent image quality of Euclid offer substantial advantages over previous work. For IC 342 this is the first study of stellar clusters other than its nuclear cluster. After selection based on size and magnitude criteria, followed by visual inspection, we identify 111 old (&gt; 1 Gyr) GC candidates in IC 342, 50 in NGC 2403 (of which 15 were previously known), and 7 in Holmberg II. In addition, a number of younger and/or intermediate-age candidates are identified. The colour distributions of GC candidates in the two larger galaxies show hints of bimodality with peaks at IE-HE = 0.36 and 0.79 (IC 342) and IE-HE = 0.36 and 0.80 (NGC 2403), corresponding to metallicities of [Fe/H]=-1.5 and [Fe/H]=-0.5, similar to those of the metal-poor and metal-rich GC subpopulations in the Milky Way. The luminosity functions of our GC candidates exhibit an excess of relatively faint objects, relative to a canonical, approximately Gaussian GC luminosity function (GCLF). The excess objects may be similar to those previously identified in other galaxies. The specific frequency of classical old GCs in IC 342, as determined based on the brighter half of the GCLF, appears to be unusually low with SN=0.2-0.3. The combined luminosity function of young and intermediate-age clusters in all three galaxies is consistent with a power-law distribution, dN/dL ~ L^(-2.3+/-0.1) and the total numbers of young clusters brighter than M(IE)=-8 in NGC 2403 and Holmberg II are comparable with those found in their Local Group counterparts, that is, M33 and the Small Magellanic Cloud, respectively.</description>

      <title>Surveys of clumps, cores, and condensations in Cygnus-X: Searching for Keplerian disks on the scale of 500 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, observational evidence of circumstellar disks around massive protostars has been steadily accumulating. However, there have also been cases of non-detections in high-mass star-forming regions, leaving the role and prevalence of disks around massive protostars still uncertain. We used high-resolution (0.2") NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations to study the 1.3 mm continuum and molecular line emission of five massive dense cores in the Cygnus-X cloud complex. Four cores host 2000-au-scale rotating structures previously identified as disk candidates in lower-resolution SMA observations, while the remaining core with no evidence for a disk serves as a comparison. With a resolution of 300 au, the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals varying levels of fragmentation in our sample, with fragment radii ranging from 150 to 800 AU. In this work, we confirm the existence of two small, stable disks in Keplerian-like rotation at scales of 500 au out of four previously identified disk candidates from the SMA observations at coarser resolution. The lack of evidence for Keplerian disks in other disk candidates identified from the SMA data suggests that rotational signatures observed at 2000 au scales do not necessarily imply the presence of Keplerian disks at smaller scales. Therefore, higher-resolution and higher-sensitivity observations are essential to definitively identify Keplerian disks on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>External tides: an important driver of velocity dispersion in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the 3D density distribution derived from the 3D dust map of the solar neighborhood, the gravitational potential is obtained by solving the Poisson equation, from which the tidal tensor is computed. In the optimal decomposition, the external tidal tensor follows the same formalism as that of a point mass. The average tidal strength of the clouds, derived from both tidal tensor analysis and pixel-by-pixel computation, shows consistent results. The equivalent velocity dispersion of the clouds, estimated from the average tidal strength, is comparable in magnitude to the velocity dispersion measured from CO (1-0) line emission. This suggests that tidal effects from surrounding material may play a significant role in driving velocity dispersion within the clouds. Future studies should carefully consider these tidal effects in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Observations of complex organic molecules in the gas phase of the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the advent of sensitive and broad bandwidth instrumentation, complex organic molecules (COMs) have been found in a wide variety of interstellar environments, not only in our Galaxy but also in external galaxies up to a redshift of 0.89. The detection of COMs in cold environments such as starless or prestellar cores has challenged our understanding of COM formation and new ideas are being implemented in chemical models and explored in laboratory experiments. At the protostellar stage, the advent of new interferometers such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has allowed the mapping of the weak emission of COMs in the protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks around both low-mass and high-mass protostars, pinpointing their location and revealing differentiation between the different families of molecules. In this way, thermal and non-thermal desorption mechanisms can be probed, constraining the efficiency of formation of COMs in the gas phase versus on grain surfaces. Some degree of continuity in the COM composition is found from the early to late stages of star formation, suggesting that a significant fraction of COMs are formed at the initial conditions of star formation. For extreme environments such as the Galactic Center, cosmic rays and low-velocity shocks seem to influence the COM composition of low and high-density gas components. The spectral confusion limit will be a major challenge for the detection of new COMs in future spectroscopic surveys. However, low-frequency interferometers targeting sources with low-excitation temperatures may help to overcome this limit.</description>

      <title>Chlorine abundances in star-forming regions of the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We study the behaviour of Cl abundance and its ratios with respect to O, S and Ar abundances in a sample of more than 200 spectra of Galactic and extragalactic H ii regions and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) of the local Universe. Methods. We use the DEep Spectra of Ionised REgions Database (DESIRED) Extended project (DESIRED-E) that comprises more than 2000 spectra of H ii regions and SFGs with direct determinations of electron temperature ($T_e$). From this database we select those spectra where it is possible to determine the Cl$^{2+}$ abundance and whose line ratios meet certain observational criteria. We calculate the physical conditions and Cl, O, S and Ar abundances in an homogeneous manner for all the spectra. We compare with results of photoionisation models to carry out an analysis of which is the most appropriate $T_e$ indicator for the nebular volume where Cl$^{2+}$ lies, proposing a scheme that improves the determination of the Cl$^{2+}$ abundance. We compare the Cl/O ratios obtained using two different ionisation correction factor (ICF) schemes. We also compare the nebular Cl/O distribution with stellar determinations. Results. Our analysis indicates that the ICF scheme proposed by Izotov et al. (2006) better reproduces the observed distributions of the Cl/O ratio. We find that the log(Cl/O) vs. 12+log(O/H) and log(Cl/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) distributions are not correlated in the whole metallicity range covered by our objects indicating a lockstep evolution of those elements. In contrast, the log(Cl/S) vs. 12+log(S/H) distribution shows a weak correlation with a slight negative slope.</description>

      <title>Halfway to the Peak: ice absorption bands at $z\approx0.5$ with JWST MIRI/MRS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first combined detections of CO$_2$, CO, XCN and water ices beyond the local Universe. We find gas-phase CO in addition to the solid phase CO. Our source, SSTXFLS J172458.3+591545, is a $z=0.494$ star-forming galaxy which also hosts a deeply obscured AGN. The profiles of its ice features are consistent with those of other Galactic and local galaxy sources and the implied ice mantle composition is similar to that of even more obscured sources. The ice features indicate the presence of a compact nucleus in our galaxy and allow us to place constraints on its density and temperature ($n&gt;10^5$cm$^{-3}$ and $T=20-90K$). We infer the visual extinction towards this nucleus to be $A_V\approx6-7$. An observed plot of $\tau_{Si}$ vs. $\tau_{CO2}/\tau_{Si}$ can be viewed as a probe for both the total dustiness of a system as well as the clumpiness of the dust along the line of sight. This paper highlights the potential of using {\sl JWST} MIRI spectra to study the dust composition and geometric distribution of sources beyond the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Stream Automatic Detection with Convolutional Neural Network (SAD-CNN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Galactic halos host faint substructures, such as stellar streams and shells, which provide insights into the hierarchical assembly history of galaxies. To date, such features have been identified in external galaxies by visual inspection. However, with the advent of larger and deeper surveys and the associated increase in data volume, this methodology is becoming impractical. Aims. Here we aim to develop an automated method to detect low surface brightness features in galactic stellar halos. Moreover, we seek to quantify its performance when considering progressively more complex data sets, including different stellar disc orientations and redshifts. Methods. We develop the Stream Automatic Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks, SAD-CNN. This tool is trained on mock surface brightness maps obtained from simulations of the Auriga Project. The model incorporates transfer learning, data augmentation and balanced datasets to optimise its detection capabilities at surface brightness limiting magnitudes ranging from 27 to 31 mag arcsec^-2. Results. The iterative training approach, coupled with transfer learning, allowed the model to adapt to increasingly challenging datasets, achieving precision and recall metrics above 80% in all considered scenarios. The use of a well-balanced training dataset is critical for mitigating biases, ensuring that the CNN accurately distinguishes between galaxies with and without streams. Conclusions. SAD-CNN is a reliable and scalable tool for automating the detection of faint substructures in galactic halos. Its adaptability makes it well-suited for future applications, including the analysis of data from upcoming large astronomical surveys (such as LSST, JWT).</description>

      <title>On the manifest link between Terzan 5 and the Galactic bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the chemical link between Terzan 5 (hereafter Ter5) and the Bulge, as probed by the observed distributions of [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios with varying [Fe/H] and by suitable statistical tests to evaluate their significance. We also present a comprehensive review of the kinematic and evolutionary properties of Ter5, based on all the available observational signatures and the scenarios proposed so far in the literature for the formation and evolution of Ter5, based on these observational facts and the recent modeling of its star formation and chemical enrichment history. This analysis confirms the complex nature of this massive stellar system, with robust evidences of a bulge in-situ formation and of a subsequent evolution that cannot be simply explained by a single merging/accretion event of two globulars or a globular and a giant molecular cloud, as proposed in the literature, but it requires a more complex star formation likely accompanied by some self-enrichment.</description>

      <title>Chronology of our Galaxy from Gaia CMD-fitting (ChronoGal): the early formation of the Milky Way disk and the impact of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derivation of precise stellar ages is considered the current major challenge to reconstruct the chronology of the Milky Way. Color-magnitude diagram (CMD)-fitting offers a robust alternative to individual age determinations via the derivation of dynamically evolved star formation histories (deSFH) and age-metallicity distributions (Gallart et al. 2024). Our new suite of routines, CMDft.Gaia, specifically developed to analyse Gaia CMDs, produce deSFHs which are robust against sensible changes in the input parameters and extremely precise, providing an unprecedentedly detailed characterization of the successive events of star formation that, since its early evolution, have shaped the current Milky Way. Also important is the fact that, thanks to the high completeness of the Gaia photometric data, CMDft.Gaia provides the actual number of stars and the mass involved in the different events of star formation.
  The current analysis of the deSFH for stellar populations within 100 pc of the Sun, as well as for kinematically selected stars in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo, allows us to sketch a tentative picture of Milky Way evolution. The findings indicate that star formation commenced very early in a thick disk, with a small fraction of stars having [M/H]&lt;-0.5 forming more than 12 Gyr ago. This phase culminated in a more prominent 12 Gyr old population with [M/H]~-0.5. Approximately 11 Gyr ago, the merger with GSE triggered an intense burst of star formation, generating most of the thick disk mass and enriching its metallicity to solar levels. Subsequently, the bulk of the star formation in the thin disk started and continues with a somewhat episodic behaviour up to the present time.</description>

      <title>HST Grism Observations of a z~1.8 Cluster Candidate from the Clusters Occupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism observations for COBRA1411+3415, originally identified as a high-redshift cluster candidate in the Clusters Occupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) survey using radio, infrared, and optical data. We spectroscopically identify seven cluster members within a 0.5 Mpc radius with grism redshifts in the range $1.8006 \leq z_{grism} \leq 1.8175$, consistent with COBRA1411+3415 being a high-redshift cluster with a mean redshift of $\langle z_{grism}\rangle = 1.8106 \pm 0.0006$. The detection of seven galaxies within this small redshift range is significant above the background distribution of galaxies at the level of 5$\sigma$. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the cluster is found to be $\sigma_{\parallel} = 701^{+347}_{-138}$ km/s with a virial mass of $M_{200} \approx 2.2^{+3.3}_{-1.3}\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. However, the mass may be lower if the cluster is still in formation. In projected phase-space, we also identify two possible infalling members of COBRA1411+3415 and two additional structures at $z\sim 1.73$ and $z\sim 1.88$. The similar spatial distributions and small projected separation from the main cluster suggest they could be a part of the same large-scale filament and together may form a protocluster system that could eventually merge to form a single, massive cluster. COBRA1411+3415 is the highest redshift cluster to be spectroscopically confirmed using a bent, double-lobed radio source as a cluster tracer.</description>

      <title>Radio Spectral Energy Distribution of Low-$z$ Metal Poor Extreme Starburst Galaxies: Novel insights on the escape of ionizing photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent optical surveys have found a rare population of low-$z$ ($z \sim 0.01 - 0.06$) extreme star-forming galaxies (xSFGs) that are the most metal-poor galaxies with strong emission lines, extremely high specific star-formation rate and low stellar mass. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, it was found that xSFGs are strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters. Their Ly$\alpha$ properties indirectly suggest that they are also strong Ly continuum (LyC) leakers. This along with several other global properties makes them similar to the recently found $z &gt; 6$ reionization-era star-forming (SF) galaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we aim to study the radio spectral energy distribution (radio-SED) of $8$ xSFGs to understand mechanisms behind the extreme nature of SF in these galaxies, particularly their high ionisation state and possible strong LyC leakage. We present new radio continuum (RC) observations using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at Band-$5$ ($1060 - 1460$ MHz) together with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S- ($2-4$ GHz), C- ($4-8$ GHz), X- ($8-12$ GHz) and Ku- ($12-18$ GHz) bands and archival LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) survey data between $120-168$ MHz for a few sources. The radio-SED of xSFGs is flat between $6-15$ GHz and shows a strong evidence for a turnover at lower frequencies in the range of $2-10$ GHz. They can be well described using a thermally dominated radio spectra with a free-free absorption component with a high emission measure. Thus the SF complexes in these galaxies are extremely young (pre-SNe stage; below $\sim 5$ Myrs) and the ISM is very dense suggesting a dominance of young massive star clusters. This can explain several extreme star-forming properties, along with the potential leakage of a significant amount of LyC photons in metal-poor extreme starburst galaxies. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Structure and kinematics of the interacting group NGC 5098/5096</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most galaxies in the Universe are found in groups, which have various morphologies and dynamical states. Studying how groups evolve is an important step for our understanding in both large-scale structure formation and galaxy evolution.
  We analysed the system composed by two groups at z = 0.037, NGC 5098, a group dominated by a pair of elliptical galaxies, and NGC 5096, a compact system which appears to be interacting with NGC 5098. We aim to describe its current dynamical state in order to investigate how it fits in our current cosmological framework.
  Our analysis is based on deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT/MegaCam) g and r imaging, archival Chandra X-ray data, and publicly available data of the galaxy redshift distribution. We model the surface brightness of the 12 brightest galaxies in the field-of-view and investigate the diffuse intragroup light that we detect. With a redshift sample of 112 galaxies, we study the dynamical states of both groups.
  We detect low surface brightness diffuse light associated with both galaxy-galaxy interactions and a possible group-group collision. The substructure we found in velocity space indicates a past interaction between both groups. This is further corroborated by the X-ray analysis.
  We conclude that NGC 5098 and NGC 5096 form a complex system, that may have collided in the past, producing a sloshing observed in X-rays and a large scale diffuse component of intragroup light as well as some important tidal debris.</description>

      <title>The impact of the Galactic bar and the Large Magellanic Cloud on hypervelocity star trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected from the Galactic Center (GC) at speeds faster than the Galactic escape velocity are useful tools to provide insight into the Milky Way's dark matter halo. However, most characterizations of HVS orbits assume static models of the Milky Way's gravitational potential. In this work, we assess the influence of the Galactic bar and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on HVS trajectories, comparing them with those from an axisymmetric potential. We simulate 28,000 HVSs ejected over the last 100 Myr and find that ignoring the bar and LMC can cause their apparent ejection location to drift by up to 100 pc. Applying two standard HVS potential fitting methods to our sample shows that they are unable to perform as designed when non-axisymmetric effects are neglected. We calculate the angle between HVS Galactocentric position and velocity and find the LMC and bar can induce a deflection angle of up to several degrees. Using mock Gaia Data Release 4 observations, however, we show that this deflection is too small in magnitude to be measured in the near future without significantly improved observational uncertainties, particularly in heliocentric distance. Our results emphasize the need to account for the bar and LMC in modeling the Galactic potential using HVSs as a tracer.</description>

      <title>A Multi-line Analysis of the Distribution and Excitation of CS and H$_2$CS in the HD 163296 Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance and distribution of sulfur-bearing molecules in protoplanetary disks directly influences the composition and potential habitability of nascent planets in addition to providing powerful probes of the physical gas conditions in the disks themselves. Here, we present new and archival ALMA and SMA observations of CS and H$_2$CS, and their C$^{34}$S and H$_2$C$^{34}$S isotopologues, at high-angular resolution (${\approx}$0."2-0."4; 20-40 au) in the HD 163296 disk, which reveal a central cavity and multi-ringed emission structure. These observations comprise the most comprehensive, multi-line CS data in a planet-forming disk to date, spanning a wide range of excitation conditions from E$_{\rm{u}}$=7.1 K to 129.3 K, and include new detections of C$^{34}$S, H$_2$CS, and H$_2$C$^{34}$S in this system. Using these data, we derive spatially-resolved rotational temperature and column density profiles for all species. We find a column density ratio N(H$_2$CS)/N(CS) $\approx$ 0.5, which is comparable to that of the similar MWC 480 disk and suggests that organic sulfur compounds may constitute a large fraction of the volatile sulfur reservoir in disks around Herbig stars generally. We derive $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios of ${\approx}$5 (CS/C$^{34}$S) and ${\approx}$2 (H$_2$CS/H$_2$C$^{34}$S) based on disk-averaged and spatially-resolved analyses. Both values are consistent across these two pairs of optically-thin molecules and are well-below the expected ISM ratio of ${\approx}$22, suggesting significant sulfur fractionation. We also constrain the CS emitting layer ($z/r\lesssim 0.1$) using the vertical separations of the disk surfaces in the channel maps and based on the known 2D gas structure of the HD 163296 disk combined with our excitation analysis.</description>

      <title>AREPO-IDORT: Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport for Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics on an Unstructured Moving Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation is crucial not only for observing astrophysical objects, but also for transporting energy and momentum. However, accurate on-the-fly radiation transport in astrophysical simulations is challenging and computationally expensive. Here we introduce AREPO-IDORT (Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport), a scheme coupled to the explicit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver in the 3D moving-mesh code AREPO. The discrete ordinates scheme means we directly solve for the specific intensities along discrete directions. We solve the time-dependent relativistic radiation transport equation via an implicit Jacobi-like iterative finite-volume solver, which overcomes the small radiation time-steps needed by explicit methods. Compared to commonly-used moment-based methods, e.g. flux-limited diffusion or M1 closure, this scheme has the advantage of correctly capturing the direction of radiation in both optically-thick and thin regions. It is based on the scheme by Jiang 2021 for the adaptive mesh refinement code ATHENA++, but we generalize the scheme to support (1) an unstructured moving-mesh, (2) local time-stepping, and (3) general equations of state. We show various test problems that commonly-used moment-based methods fail to reproduce accurately. To apply the scheme to a real astrophysics problem, we show the first global 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the entire convective envelope of a red supergiant star. (abridged) For this problem, the radiation module only takes less than half of the total computational cost. Our current scheme assumes grey radiation, is first-order accurate in both time and space (abridged). We expect our scheme will enable more accurate multi-scale radiation MHD simulations involving supersonic bulk motions, ranging from planet formation in protoplanetary disks, stars and associated transients, to accretion flows near black holes.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the dynamics of cosmic vortices: Probing a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the jet of 3C 84</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the creation of relativistic jets originating from active galactic nuclei, require a thorough understanding of the accompanying plasma instabilities. Our high sensitivity, high resolution, global very long baseline interferometry observations of the jet in the radio galaxy 3C 84 enable us to study its inner morphology, which resembles a thread-like pattern. We find that this pattern can be described by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, consisting of four instability modes. Our model favours a jet described by a Mach number of $M_\textrm{j} = 5.0\pm1.7$ and a sound speed of $\alpha_\textrm{j} = 0.14\pm0.06$. With it, we are able to describe the internal structure of 3C 84 and to tentatively connect the origin of the instability to accretion disc activity.</description>

      <title>Integral field spectroscopy of the planetary nebula NGC 3242 and the puzzling nature of its low ionization structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physico-chemical properties of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 3242 are investigated in both 1D and 2D, using Integral Field Unit (IFU) data. This PN has a complex morphology with multiple shells and contains a pair of structures with a lower degree of ionization compared to the main nebular components. These structures are known as low ionization structures (LISs), and their origin is still a mystery. With the capabilities provided by IFU spectroscopy, we aim to gain a better understanding of the behavior of nebular properties in the LISs. Data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) were used in order to perform a spatially resolved physico-chemical analysis of NGC 3242 both in 2D, through the analysis of emission line maps, and in 1D, simulating long-slit spectroscopy, with pseudo-slits. Through the deeper investigation of MUSE data, we detect new structures perpendicular to the pair of LISs of NGC 3242, which are mainly seen in the light of [S III] and [N II]. In addition, two arc-like structures are revealed. Moreover, an inner jet-like structure is found through its [Fe III] emission. The interaction of the jet with the rim may be related to the formation of knots and blobs. The higher value of Te, is estimated from the [S III] diagnostic lines, followed by Te ([N II]), Te(H I) and finally Te (He I). In all cases, Te is higher at the inner nebular structures. Regarding electron density, ne, is lower at the LISs, while an increase is observed at the nebular rim. Diagnostic diagrams confirm that NGC 3242 is a highly ionized nebula. Moreover, the MUSE data unveiled for the first time in this PN, the atomic line [C I] {\lambda}8727, primarily emitted from the LISs. This finding suggests that these structures may consist of a molecular core surrounded by neutral and ionized gas</description>

      <title>NEIDSpecMatch: stellar parameter estimation with NEID spectra using an empirical library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NEIDSpecMatch, a tool developed to extract stellar parameters from spectra obtained with the NEID spectrograph. NEIDSpecMatch is based on SpecMatch-Emp and HPFSpecMatch, which estimate stellar parameters by comparing the observed spectrum to well-characterized library spectra. This approach has proven effective for M dwarfs. Utilizing a library of 78 stellar spectra covering effective temperatures from $3000-6000$ K, NEIDSpecMatch derives key parameters, including effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Cross-validation shows median uncertainties of $\sigma_{T_{\mathrm{eff}}} = 115\,\mathrm{K}$, $\sigma_{[\mathrm{Fe/H}]} = 0.143$, and $\sigma_{\log g} = 0.073$ across 49 orders.

      <title>An attempt to determine the magnetic field configuration in the planetary nebula K 3-35 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examined dust polarisation within the planetary nebula (PN) K 3-35 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). This investigation aimed to identify and trace the magnetic field within the PN, as it potentially plays a crucial role in shaping this bipolar nebula. Our findings include a marginal detection of the polarised region and low fractional polarisation (peaking at 1.4%). Assuming a certain level of validity, we observed well-organised dust grains aligned along the equatorial plane of the PN, indicating a magnetic field alignment with the outflows. The limited polarisation detection at submillimeter wavelengths in this PN and others may be attributed to a pronounced optical depth. However, our K 3-35 analysis with the code DUSTY does not seem to support this idea. We also modelled the SED of K3-35, and our best-fit models included a mixture of silicates and amorphous carbon. The grains of amorphous carbon are less susceptible to alignment with the magnetic field, which could, at least partially, explain the observed low polarisation. The models presented in this article should be considered preliminary, and a more advanced approach is needed for a more complete interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the origin of the elements. IX. 3D NLTE abundances of metals in the context of Galactic Chemical Evolution Models and 4MOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, various methods have been employed to understand the origin of the elements, including observations of elemental abundances which have been compared to Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. It is also well known that 1D Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) measurements fail to accurately capture elemental abundances. Non-LTE (NLTE) effects may play a significant role, and neglecting them leads to erroneous implications in galaxy modelling. In this paper, we calculate 3D NLTE abundances of seven key iron-peak and neutron-capture elements (Mn, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, Eu) based on carefully assembled 1D LTE literature measurements, and investigate their impact within the context of the OMEGA+ GCE model. Our findings reveal that 3D NLTE abundances are significantly higher for iron-peak elements at [Fe/H]&lt; -3, with (for the first time ever) [Ni/Fe] and (confirming previous studies) [Co/Fe] on average reaching 0.6-0.8 dex, and [Mn/Fe] reaching -0.1 dex, which current 1D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models cannot explain. We also observe a slightly higher production of neutron-capture elements at low metallicities, with 3D NLTE abundances of Eu being higher by +0.2 dex at [Fe/H]= -3. 3D effects are most significant for iron-peak elements in the very metal-poor regime, with average differences between 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE {reaching} up to 0.15 dex. Thus, ignoring 3D NLTE effects introduces significant biases, so including {them} should be considered whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). III. Retrieval of Planetary Masses in Binaries Using the N-body Model with RV and Astrometry Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given that secular perturbations in a binary system not only excite high orbital eccentricities but also alter the planetary orbital inclination, the classical Keplerian orbital model is no longer applicable for orbital retrieval. The combination of a dynamical model and observational data is essential for characterizing the configuration and planetary mass in close binaries. We calculate the theoretical radial velocity (RV) signal in the N-body framework and observe a drift in the RV semi-amplitude, which leads to a reduction in the $m$sin$i$ detection threshold by 20 $M_{\oplus}$, with $\sim$ 100% detection probability in the $m_1$sin$i_1$-$a_1$ parameter space. High-precision RV data with an accuracy of 1 m/s can detect such dynamical effects. For four close-in binaries-GJ 86, GJ 3021, HD 196885, and HD 41004, the deviation between the minimum mass derived from the Keplerian and N-body models is found to be $&gt; 0.2 ~ M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. High-precision astrometric data are also necessary to resolve the 3D orbits and true masses exoplanets. We generate astrometric simulation data with accuracies corresponding to Gaia (57.8 $\mu$as) and the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) (1 $\mu$as), respectively. Joint orbit fitting is performed for RV + Gaia and RV + CHES synergy methods. Compared with the fitting results from the astrometry-only model, the synergy models more effectively constrain the range of orbital inclinations. Using simulation data, we derive precise uncertainties for the true planetary mass, which are critical for determining the evolution of planets around binary stars and multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Tidal Amplitudes in the Magellanic Cloud Population of Heartbeat Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heartbeat (HB) stars exhibit pulses in their light curves once per orbit due to ellipsoidal distortions from strong tides at periapse. We analyze the population of HB stars in the Magellanic Clouds captured by the OGLE survey, and provide broadband spectral energy distribution fitting to estimate physical properties of the HB stars. The HB stars span a wide range of luminosities, radii, and effective temperatures. However, we find that they cluster near loci of strong tidal influence at periapse, indicating that in nearly all cases, strong tides are indeed responsible for their photometric variability. HB stars tend to populate regions away from the main sequence, where stellar evolution is particularly rapid. We examine the distribution of tidal amplitudes, and show that these can be interpreted through a simplified model of radius growth through stellar evolution and orbital circularization through linear tidal dissipation. When we compare rates of tidal dissipation, we find differences between the modeled modified tidal quality factor among hot ($T_{\rm eff}&gt;6250$~K), $Q_\ast' \gtrsim 10^7$, and cool ($T_{\rm eff}&lt;6250$~K), $Q_\ast'\sim 10^5$, stars, which is qualitatively consistent with models of efficient tidal dissipation in the convective envelopes of cool stars. We find that this model can reproduce the observed observed locations and amplitudes of HB stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The hot stars, in particular, extend to amplitudes near, but not beyond, the threshold for nonlinear tidal wave breaking on stellar surfaces, suggesting a physical saturation of tidal amplitudes at this threshold.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Chaos: From Galactic Dynamics to Plasma Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of chaos in Hamiltonian models describing charged particle orbits in plasma, star motions in barred galaxies, and orbits' diffusion in multidimensional maps. We systematically explore the interplay between magnetic and kinetic chaos in toroidal fusion plasmas, where non-axisymmetric perturbations disrupt smooth magnetic flux surfaces, generating complex particle trajectories. Using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method, we efficiently quantify chaos, compare the behavior of magnetic field lines and particle orbits, visualize the radial distribution of chaotic regions, and offer GALI as a valuable tool for studying plasma physics dynamics. We also study the evolution of phase space structures in a 3D barred galactic potential, following successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits. By employing the `color and rotation' technique to visualize the system's 4D Poincar\'e surface of sections, we reveal distinct structural patterns. We further investigate the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of single and coupled standard maps, focusing on parameters inducing anomalous diffusion through accelerator modes exhibiting ballistic transport. Using different ensembles of initial conditions in chaotic regions influenced by these modes, we examine asymptotic diffusion rates and time scales, identifying conditions suppressing anomalous transport and leading to long-term convergence to normal diffusion across coupled maps. Lastly, we perform the first comprehensive investigation into the GALI indices for various attractors in continuous and discrete-time dissipative systems, extending the method's application to non-Hamiltonian systems. A key aspect of our work involves analyzing and comparing GALIs' with Lyapunov Exponents for systems exhibiting hyperchaotic motion.</description>

      <title>The SPT-Deep Cluster Catalog: Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Selected Clusters from Combined SPT-3G and SPTpol Measurements over 100 Square Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 500 galaxy cluster candidates in the SPT-Deep field: a 100 deg$^2$ field that combines data from the SPT-3G and SPTpol surveys to reach noise levels of 3.0, 2.2, and 9.0 $\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. This is comparable to noise levels expected for the wide field survey of CMB-S4, a next-generation CMB experiment. Candidates are selected via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with a minimum significance of $\xi = 4.0$, resulting in a catalog of purity $\sim 89 \%$. Optical data from the Dark Energy Survey and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope are used to confirm 442 cluster candidates. The clusters span $0.12 &lt; z \lesssim 1.8$ and $1.0 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70} &lt; M_{500c} &lt; 8.7 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$. The sample's median redshift is 0.74 and the median mass is $1.7 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$; these are the lowest median mass and highest median redshift of any SZ-selected sample to date. We assess the effect of infrared emission from cluster member galaxies on cluster selection by performing a joint fit to the infrared dust and tSZ signals by combining measurements from SPT and overlapping submillimeter data from Herschel/SPIRE. We find that at high redshift ($z&gt;1)$, the tSZ signal is reduced by $17.4^{+3.1}_{-2.9} \%$ ($3.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}\%$) at 150 GHz (95 GHz) due to dust contamination. We repeat our cluster finding method on dust-nulled SPT maps and find the resulting catalog is consistent with the nominal SPT-Deep catalog, demonstrating dust contamination does not significantly impact the SPT-Deep selection function; we attribute this lack of bias to the inclusion of the SPT 220 GHz band.</description>

      <title>Deep Photometric Observations of Ultra-Faint Milky Way Satellites Centaurus I and Eridanus IV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep Magellan$+$Megacam imaging of Centaurus I (Cen I) and Eridanus IV (Eri IV), two recently discovered Milky Way ultra-faint satellites. Our data reach $\sim2-3$ magnitudes deeper than the discovery data from the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey. We use these data to constrain their distances, structural properties (e.g., half-light radii, ellipticity, and position angle), and luminosities. We investigate whether these systems show signs of tidal disturbance, and identify new potential member stars using Gaia EDR3. Our deep color-magnitude diagrams show that Cen I and Eri IV are consistent with an old ($\tau\sim 13.0$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($\text{[Fe/H]}\le-2.2$) stellar population. We find Cen I to have a half-light radius of $r_{h}=2.60\pm0.30'$ ($90.6\pm11$ pc), an ellipticity of $\epsilon=0.36\pm0.05$, a distance of $D=119.8\pm4.1$ kpc ($m-M=20.39\pm0.08$ mag), and an absolute magnitude of $M_{V}=-5.39\pm0.19$. Similarly, Eri IV has $r_{h}=3.24\pm0.48'$ ($65.9\pm10$ pc), $\epsilon=0.26\pm0.09$, $D=69.9\pm3.6$ kpc ($m-M=19.22\pm0.11$ mag), and $M_{V}=-3.55\pm0.24$. These systems occupy a space on the size-luminosity plane consistent with other known Milky Way dwarf galaxies which supports the findings from our previous spectroscopic follow-up. Cen I has a well-defined morphology which lacks any clear evidence of tidal disruption, whereas Eri IV hosts a significant extended feature with multiple possible interpretations.</description>

      <title>Zapped then Napped? A rapidly quenched remnant leaker candidate with a steep spectroscopic $\beta_{UV}$ slope at z=8.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam Photometry to explore the properties of JADES-GS8-RL-1, a rapidly quenched, $z=8.5$ galaxy with a stellar mass of $10^{8.9}M_\odot$, a steep blue UV slope, a Balmer break, and no sign of strong emission lines. With a $\beta_{UV}$=-2.8$\pm 0.2$, as measured from the NIRSpec spectrum, JADES-GS8-RL-1 is consistent with negligible dust attenuation and little to no contribution from the nebular continuum alongside a probable high escape fraction. The $\beta_{UV}$ slope measured from photometry varies from -3.0 in the central regions to -2.2 at the outskirts suggesting possible regional differences in the escape fraction. There are no high-ionisation emission lines, only a tentative 2.9\sig detection of [OII]. Using photometry, this emission appears to be extended, possibly corresponding to weakly ionised gas expelled during or after the quenching process. JADES-GS8-RL-1 is spatially resolved with a half-light radius of 240 pc and has an exponential, disc-like morphology. It appears to have formed all its stars in a short burst within the past 100 Myr with a formation time of $\approx$70 Myr and a quenching time of $\approx$30 Myr. This quenching would have occurred rapidly, making it a more distant example of the kind of low-mass "mini-quenched" galaxies previously observed at high-z. Due to the extremely blue $\beta_{UV}$ slope, our best-fit model predicts a high value for \fesc of &gt;10\%, consistent with the value derived from the $\beta_{UV}$ slope, which when combined with our extraordinarily low O32 upper limit suggests JADES-GS8-RL-1 is a fascinating example of a high-z "remnant leaker" in one of its earliest phases, deep in the epoch of reionisation.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the evolution of the MHI-M* scaling relation combining CHILES and MIGHTEE-HI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00110</link>

Abstract: The improved sensitivity of interferometric facilities to the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen (HI) enables studies of its properties in galaxies beyond the local Universe. In this work, we perform a 21 cm line spectral stacking analysis combining the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys in the COSMOS field to derive a robust HI-stellar mass relation at z=0.36. In particular, by stacking thousands of star-forming galaxies subdivided into stellar mass bins, we optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of targets and derive mean HI masses in the different stellar mass intervals for the investigated galaxy population. We combine spectra from the two surveys, estimate HI masses, and derive the scaling relation log10(MHI) = (0.32 +- 0.04)log10(M*) + (6.65 +- 0.36). Our findings indicate that galaxies at z=0.36 are HI richer than those at z=0, but HI poorer than those at z=1, with a slope consistent across redshift, suggesting that stellar mass does not significantly affect HI exchange mechanisms. We also observe a slower growth rate HI relative to the molecular gas, supporting the idea that the accretion of cold gas is slower than the rate of consumption of molecular gas to form stars. This study contributes to understanding the role of atomic gas in galaxy evolution and sets the stage for future development of the field in the upcoming SKA era.</description>

      <title>The Qz5 Survey (I): How the HI Mass Density of the Universe Evolves With Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report that the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass density of the Universe ($\rho_{HI}$) increases with cosmic time since $z \sim 5$, peaks at $z \sim 3$, and then decreases toward $z \sim 0$. This is the first result of Qz5, our spectroscopic survey of 63 quasars at $z \gtrsim 5$ with VLT/X-SHOOTER and Keck/ESI aimed at characterizing intervening HI gas absorbers at $z \sim 5$. The main feature of Qz5 is the high resolution ($R \sim 7000 - 9000$) of the spectra, which allows us to (1) accurately detect high column density HI gas absorbers in an increasingly neutral intergalactic medium at $z \sim 5$ and (2) determine the reliability of previous $\rho_{HI}$ measurements derived with lower resolution spectroscopy. We find 5 intervening Damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z &gt; 4.5$, which corresponds to the lowest DLA incidence rate ($0.034^{0.05}_{0.02}$) at $z \gtrsim 2$. We also measure the lowest $\rho_{HI}$ at $z \gtrsim 2$ from our sample of DLAs and subDLAs, corresponding to $\rho_{HI} = 0.56^{0.82}_{0.31} \times 10^8~$M$_{\odot}~$Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 5$. Taking into account our measurements at $z \sim 5$ and systematic biases in the DLA detection rate at lower spectral resolutions, we conclude that $\rho_{HI}$ doubles from $z \sim 5$ to $z \sim 3$. From these results emerges a qualitative agreement between how the cosmic densities of HI gas mass, molecular gas mass, and star-formation rate build up with cosmic time.</description>

      <title>A Million Three-body Binaries Caught by Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia observations have revealed over a million stellar binary candidates within ~1 kpc of the Sun, predominantly characterized by orbital separations &gt;10^3 AU and eccentricities &gt;0.7. The prevalence of such wide, eccentric binaries has proven challenging to explain through canonical binary formation channels. However, recent advances in our understanding of three-body binary formation (3BBF) -- new binary assembly by the gravitational scattering of three unbound bodies -- have shown that 3BBF in star clusters can efficiently generate wide, highly eccentric binaries. We further explore this possibility by constructing a semi-analytic model of the Galactic binary population in the solar neighborhood, originating from 3BBF in star clusters. The model relies on 3BBF scattering experiments to determine how the 3BBF rate and resulting binary properties scale with local stellar density and velocity dispersion. We then model the Galactic star cluster population, incorporating up-to-date prescriptions for the Galaxy's star formation history as well as the birth properties and internal evolution of its star clusters. Finally, we account for binary destruction induced by perturbations from stellar interactions before cluster escape and and for subsequent changes to binary orbital elements by dynamical interactions in the Galactic field. Without any explicit fine-tuning, our model closely reproduces both the total number of Gaia's wide binaries and their separation distribution, and qualitatively matches the eccentricity distribution, suggesting that 3BBF may be an important formation channel for these enigmatic systems.</description>

      <title>Straightening the Ruler: Field-Level Inference of the BAO Scale with LEFTfield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current inferences of the BAO scale from galaxy clustering employ a reconstruction technique at fixed cosmology and bias parameters. Here, we present the first consistent joint Bayesian inference of the isotropic BAO scale, jointly varying the initial conditions as well as all bias coefficients, based on the EFT-based field-level forward model $\texttt{LEFTfield}$. We apply this analysis to mock data generated at a much higher cutoff, or resolution, resulting in a significant model mismatch between mock data and the model used in the inference. We demonstrate that the remaining systematic bias in the BAO scale is below 2% for all data considered and below 1% when Eulerian bias is used for inference. Furthermore, we find that the inferred error on the BAO scale is typically 30%, and up to 50%, smaller compared to that from a replication of the standard post-reconstruction power-spectrum approach, using the same scales as in the field-level inference. The improvement in BAO scale precision grows towards smaller scales (higher $k$). As a validation test, we repeat this comparison on a mock dataset that is linearly biased with respect to a 1LPT (Zel'dovich) density field, following the assumption made in standard reconstruction approaches. We find that field-level inference indeed yields the same error bar as the post-reconstruction power spectrum, which is expectd to be optimal in this case. In summary, a field-level approach to BAO not only allows for a consistent inference of the BAO scale, but promises to achieve more precise measurements on realistic, nonlinearly biased tracers as well.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon conversion down to the nonrelativistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a magnetic field, axions can convert into photons and vice versa. The phenomenology of the conversion is captured by a system of two coupled Klein-Gordon equations, which, assuming that the axion is relativistic, is usually recast into a pair of first-order Schr\"odinger-like equations. In such a limit, focusing on a constant magnetic field and plasma frequency, the equations admit an exact analytic solution. The relativistic limit significantly simplifies the calculations and, therefore, it is widely used in phenomenological applications. In this work, we discuss how to evaluate the axion-photon system evolution without relying on such relativistic approximation. In particular, we give an exact analytical solution, valid for any axion energy, in the case that both the magnetic field and plasma frequency are constant. Moreover, we devise an analytic perturbative expansion that allows for tracking the conversion probability in a slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field or plasma frequency, whose characteristic scale of variation is much larger than the typical axion-photon oscillation length. Finally, we discuss a case of resonant axion-photon conversion giving useful simplified formulae that might be directly applied to dark matter axions converting in neutron star magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Jet Archaeology and Forecasting: Image Variability and Magnetic Field Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how magnetic field variations around accreting black holes on event horizon scales affect the morphology of magnetically-driven jet on larger scales. By performing radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we find that temporal variation in the magnetic flux on the event horizon and the jet power are imprinted on the variability of jet width up to several hundred gravitational radii. When the magnetic flux around the black hole drops and then rises, the jet initially narrows or becomes truncated, then widens, creating a thin-thick pattern that propagates down the jet. This suggests that extended jet observations can provide a history record of horizon-scale magnetic field dynamics, and conversely, upcoming changes in the jet image can be predicted from direct observation of the magnetized accreting plasma near the black hole. Furthermore, the pattern of jet width variations shows acceleration up to the relativistic regime as it moves away from the black hole, aligning with plasma bulk motion. We also find in time-averaged images that both the bulk plasma motion and magnetic field configuration in the jet-launching region, which are sensitive to black hole spin, shape diverse features through relativistic beaming and aberration. Higher black hole spins result in more poloidal bulk motion and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to more symmetric jet images and linear polarization patterns. These results suggest a new method for testing the magnetically arrested disk model and the Blandford-Znajek process, and for determining the black hole spin through observations bridging horizon and jet-launching scales.</description>
