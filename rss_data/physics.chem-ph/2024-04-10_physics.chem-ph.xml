      <title>Spin-free exact two-component linear response coupled cluster theory for estimation of frequency-dependent second-order property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have presented the theory, implementation, and benchmark results for spin-free exact two-component (SFX2C) linear response coupled cluster (LRCCSD) theory for static and dynamic polarizabilities of atoms and molecules. The resolution of identity (RI) approximation for two-electron integrals has been used to reduce the computational cost of the calculation and has been shown to have a negligible effect on accuracy. The calculated static and dynamic polarizability values agree very well with the more expensive X2C-LR-CCSD results. Our calculated results show that accurate predictions of polarizabilities of atoms and molecules containing heavy atoms require the use of a large basis set containing an adequate number of diffuse functions, in addition to accounting for electron correlation and relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Regularized relativistic corrections for polyelectronic and polyatomic systems with explicitly correlated Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drachmann's regularization approach is implemented for floating explicitly correlated Gaussians (fECGs) and molecular systems. Earlier applications of Drachmannized relativistic corrections for molecular systems were hindered due to the unknown analytic matrix elements of $1/r_{ix}1/r_{jy}$-type operators with fECGs. In the present work, one of the $1/r$ factors is approximated by a linear combination of Gaussians, which results in calculable integrals. The numerical approach is found to be precise and robust over a range of molecular systems and nuclear configurations, and thus, it opens the route towards an automated evaluation of high-precision relativistic corrections over potential energy surfaces of polyatomic systems. Furthermore, the newly developed integration approach makes it possible to construct the matrix representation of the square of the electronic Hamiltonian relevant for energy lower-bound as well as time-dependent computations of molecular systems with a flexible and high-precision fECG basis representation.</description>

      <title>Complete Active Space Iterative Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility of improving multireference-driven coupled cluster (CC) approaches with an algorithm that iteratively combines complete active space (CAS) calculations with tailored CC and externally corrected CC. This is accomplished by establishing a feedback loop between the CC and CAS parts of a calculation through similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with those CC amplitudes that are not encompassed by the active space. We denote this approach the complete active space iterative coupled cluster (CASiCC) ansatz. We investigate its efficiency and accuracy in the singles and doubles approximation by studying the prototypical molecules H4, H8, H2O, and N2. Our results demonstrate that CASiCC systematically improves on the single-reference CCSD and the ecCCSD methods across entire potential energy curves, while retaining modest computational costs. However, the tailored coupled cluster method shows superior performance in the strong correlation regime suggesting that its accuracy is based on error compensation. We find that the iterative version of externally corrected and tailored coupled cluster methods converge to the same results.</description>

      <title>MLatom software ecosystem for surface hopping dynamics in Python with quantum mechanical and machine learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source MLatom@XACS software ecosystem for on-the-fly surface hopping nonadiabatic dynamics based on the Landau-Zener-Belyaev-Lebedev (LZBL) algorithm. The dynamics can be performed via Python API with a wide range of quantum mechanical (QM) and machine learning (ML) methods, including ab initio QM (CASSCF and ADC(2)), semi-empirical QM methods (e.g., AM1, PM3, OMx, and ODMx), and many types of machine learning potentials (e.g., KREG, ANI, and MACE). Combinations of QM and ML methods can also be used. While the user can build their own combinations, we provide AIQM1, which is based on {\Delta}-learning and can be used out of the box. We showcase how AIQM1 reproduces the isomerization quantum yield of trans-azobenzene at a low cost. We provide example scripts that, in a dozen lines, enable the user to obtain the final population plots by simply providing the initial geometry of a molecule. Thus, those scripts perform geometry optimization, normal mode calculations, initial condition sampling, parallel trajectories propagation, population analysis, and final result plotting. Given the capabilities of MLatom to be used for training different ML models, this ecosystem can be seamlessly integrated into the protocols building ML models for nonadiabatic dynamics. In the future, a deeper and more efficient integration of MLatom with Newton-X will enable vast range of functionalities for surface hopping dynamics, such as fewest-switches surface hopping, to facilitate similar workflows via the Python API.</description>

      <title>Continuous Floquet Theory in Solid-State NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the application of continuous Floquet theory in solid-state NMR. Continuous Floquet theory extends traditional Floquet theory to non-continuous Hamiltonians, enabling the description of observable effects not fully captured by traditional Floquet theory due to its requirement for a periodic Hamiltonian. We present closed-form expressions for computing first and second-order effective Hamiltonians, streamlining integration with traditional Floquet theory and facilitating application in NMR experiments featuring multiple modulation frequencies. Subsequently, we show examples of the practical application of Continuous Floquet theory by investigating several solid-state NMR experiments. These examples illustrate the importance of the duration of the pulse scheme regarding the width of the resonance conditions and the near-resonance behavior.</description>

      <title>Toward Reliable Dipole Moments without Single Excitations: The Role of Orbital Rotations and Dynamical Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dipole moment is a crucial molecular property linked to a molecular system's bond polarity and overall electronic structure. To that end, the electronic dipole moment, which results from the electron density of a system, is often used to assess the accuracy and reliability of new electronic structure methods. This work analyses electronic dipole moments computed with the pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) ansatz and its linearized coupled cluster (pCCD-LCC) corrections using the canonical Hartree--Fock and pCCD-optimized (localized) orbital bases. The accuracy of pCCD-based dipole moments is assessed against experimental and CCSD(T) reference values using relaxed and unrelaxed density matrices and different basis set sizes. Our test set comprises molecules of various bonding patterns and electronic structures, exposing pCCD-based methods to a wide range of electron correlation effects. Additionally, we investigate the performance of pCCD-in-DFT dipole moments of some model complexes. Finally, our work indicates the importance of orbital relaxation in the pCCD model and shows the limitations of the linearized couple cluster corrections in predicting electronic dipole moments of multiple-bonded systems. Most importantly, pCCD with a linearized CCD correction can reproduce the dipole moment surfaces in singly-bonded molecules, which are comparable to the multi-reference ones.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Particle Self-Consistent $GW$ for Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the formalism and implementation of quasi-particle self-consistent GW (qsGW) and eigenvalue only quasi-particle self-consistent GW (evGW) adapted to standard quantum chemistry packages. Our implementation is benchmarked against high-level quantum chemistry computations (coupled-cluster theory) and experimental results using a representative set of molecules. Furthermore, we compare the qsGW approach for five molecules relevant for organic photovoltaics to self-consistent GW results (scGW) and analyze the effects of the self-consistency on the ground state density by comparing calculated dipole moments to their experimental values. We show that qsGW makes a significant improvement over conventional G0W0 and that partially self-consistent flavors (in particular evGW) can be excellent alternatives.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

      <title>Thermophysical properties of argon gas from improved two-body interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new ab initio interaction potential for the electronic ground state of the argon dimer has been developed. The new potential uses previously calculated accurate Born--Oppenheimer potential while significantly improving the description of relativistic effects by including the two-electron Darwin and orbit-orbit corrections. Moreover, retardation of the electromagnetic interactions is taken into account in the long-range part of the potential and leading-order quantum electrodynamics correction is calculated. Spectroscopic properties of the argon dimer such as positions of vibrational levels, bond-dissociation energy, and rotational and centrifugal-distortion constants are reported. We show that the inclusion of the two-electron relativistic terms results in a destabilization of the previously discovered weakly bound ninth vibrational state. Finally, thermophysical properties of the argon gas including pressure and acoustic virial coefficients, as well as transport properties -- viscosity and thermal conductivity -- are evaluated using the new potential. For the thermophysical properties, the obtained ab initio values are somewhat less accurate than the most recent experimental results. However, the opposite is true for the transport properties, where the theoretical results calculated in this work have significantly smaller uncertainties than the data derived from measurements.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Mechanisms Behind Non Aromatic Fluorescence with Density Functional Tight Binding Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental findings reveal non-conventional fluorescence emission in biological systems devoid of conjugated bonds or aromatic compounds, termed \textit{Non-Aromatic Fluorescence} (NAF). This phenomenon is exclusive to aggregated or solid states, remaining absent in monomeric solutions. Previous studies focused on small model systems in vacuum show that the carbonyl stretching mode along with strong interaction of short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) remain the primary vibrational mode explaining NAF in these systems. In order to simulate larger model systems taking into account the effects of the surrounding environment, in this work we propose using the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method in combination with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) and the mixed quantum/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach. We investigate the mechanism behind NAF in the crystal structure of L-pyroglutamine-ammonium, comparing it with the related non-fluorescent amino acid L-glutamine. Our results extend our previous findings to more realistic systems, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed DFTB method in the context of NAMD in biological systems. Furthemore, due to its inherent low computational cost, this method allows for a better sampling on the non-radiative events at the conical intersection which is crucial for a complete understanding of this phenomenon. Beyond contributing to the ongoing exploration of NAF, this work paves the way for future application of this method in more complex biological systems such as amyloid aggregates, biomaterials and non-aromatic proteins.</description>

      <title>Attosecond X-ray Chronoscopy of Core-level Photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond photoemission or photoionization delays are a unique probe of the structure and the electronic dynamics of matter. However, spectral congestion and spatial delocalization of valence electron wave functions set fundamental limits to the complexity of systems that can be studied and the information that can be retrieved, respectively. Using attosecond X-ray pulses from LCLS, we demonstrate the key advantages of measuring core-level delays: the photoelectron spectra remain atom-like, the measurements become element specific and the observed scattering dynamics originate from a point-like source. We exploit these unique features to reveal the effects of electronegativity and symmetry on attosecond scattering dynamics by measuring the photoionization delays between N-1s and C-1s core shells of a series of aromatic azabenzene molecules. Remarkably, the delays systematically increase with the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule and reveal multiple resonances. We identify two previously unknown mechanisms regulating the associated attosecond dynamics, namely the enhanced confinement of the trapped wavefunction with increasing electronegativity of the atoms and the decrease of the coupling strength among the photoemitted partial waves with increasing symmetry. This study demonstrates the unique opportunities opened by measurements of core-level photoionization delays for unravelling attosecond electron dynamics in complex matter.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation with non-linear couplings: Comparison between Fermi's golden rule and extended dissipaton equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates, denoted as $T_1^{-1}$. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength and nonlinear spin-lattice interactions, FGR's applicability may diminish. This paper numerically evaluates the exact spin-lattice relaxation rate kernels, employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. Our calculations reveal that when quadratic spin-lattice coupling is considered, the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since FGR ignores the non-Markovian nature of spin-lattice relaxation. Our methods can be readily applied to other systems with nonlinear spin-lattice interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of $T_1$ in molecular qubits.</description>
