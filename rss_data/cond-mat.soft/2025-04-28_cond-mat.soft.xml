      <title>Translocation of Active Polymerlike Worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active polymer translocation through confined spaces is a key biological process underlying DNA transport through nuclear pores and actin filament dynamics in cell migration. Here, we use living polymer-like Tubifex tubifex worms as a model system to explore how contour length and activity-modulated via environmental temperature-affect translocation dynamics in confined geometries. Using 3D-printed chambers connected by a narrow bridge, we track worm conformation and motion under confinement. In contrast to passive polymers, contour length has no influence, while activity strongly modulates escape dynamics. At an intermediate temperature of 20{\deg}C, an optimal balance between directed propulsion and reorientation-characterized by the P\'eclet number-maximizes translocation efficiency. Our findings suggest that active filaments achieve optimal exploration of confined spaces at intermediate activity levels. We further validate our results through simulations of tangentially driven polymer models which quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings at ambient temperature.</description>

      <title>More is less in unpercolated active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable feat of active matter physics is that systems as diverse as collections of self-propelled particles, nematics mixed with molecular motors, and interacting robots can all be described by symmetry-based continuum theories. These descriptions rely on reducing complex effects of individual motors to a few key active parameters, which increase with activity. Here we discover a striking anomaly in the continuum description of non-reciprocal active solids, a ubiquitous class of active materials. We find that as microscopic activity increases, macroscale active response can vanish: more is less. In this highly active regime, non-affine and localized modes prevail and destroy the large-scale signature of microscopic activity. These modes exist in any dilute periodic structure and emerge in random lattices below a percolation transition. Our results unveil a counterintuitive facet of active matter, offering new principles for engineering materials far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Avalanche Relaxation and Yielding Rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yielding transition in amorphous materials, whether driven passively (simple shear) or actively, remains a fundamental open question in soft matter physics. While avalanche statistics at the critical point have been extensively studied, the emergence of the dynamic regime at yielding and the steady-state flow properties remain poorly understood. In particular, the significant variability observed in flow curves across different systems lacks a clear explanation. We introduce the Controlled Relaxation Time Model (CRTM), a novel simulation framework that treats relaxation time as a tunable parameter, seamlessly bridging quasistatic avalanche statistics and dynamic flow regimes. CRTM reproduces known results in both limits and enables direct analysis of the transition between them, providing precise measurements of avalanche relaxation times. Applying CRTM to different microscopic dynamics, we find that a previously proposed scaling relation connecting critical exponents holds for passive systems. However, active systems exhibit significant deviations, suggesting a missing ingredient in the current understanding of active yielding.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear responses of physical systems to strong perturbations are notoriously difficult to tackle analytically. Here, we present analytic results for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory magnetic fields based on a particular model for the magnetization dynamics. A number of characteristic features of the in-phase and out-of-phase higher-harmonic response are found and analyzed. In particular we find that the magnitude of higher harmonic contributions Rn depends on the field amplitude and frequency only via a single scaling variable that combines the two quantities. The decrease of |Rn|with increasing order nof harmonics is a key quantity monitored in biomedical applications such as magnetic particle spectroscopy and magnetic particle imaging. Except for the first few harmonics, we find that this decrease is exponential with a rate that depends on the scaling variable only. For not too high frequencies and not loo large amplitudes, we find that these exact results for one particular model of magnetization dynamics hold approximately also for other, more frequently used models. Our results therefore offer not only deeper insight into strongly nonlinear responses of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for higher harmonics that are very difficult to determine numerically, but also suggest analyzing data in terms of a scaling variable.</description>

      <title>Universality of Dynamic and Thermodynamic Behavior of Polymers near their Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of amorphous materials near the glass transition is a major challenge in soft-matter physics and polymer engineering. Here, we show that the dependence of the dielectric alpha-relaxation time on temperature can be captured by a universal equation with only two independent parameters, Tg and fragility, m. This is similar in spirit to the ideas of van Krevelen and Bicerano, and can be related to the Boyer-Spencer and Simha-Boyer rules for the volumetric thermal expansion via a modified free-volume approach such as Sanchez-Lacombe "Two-state, two-(time)scale" (SL-TS2) theory. The model is compared to experimental data for nine amorphous polymers with varying values of Tg and m, and a good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. We also derive the relationship between the experimental and computational (high-cooling-rate) Tg, and compare our model prediction for the Tg-shift between the two with the simulation results of Afzal et al., finding a good qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement. The results could serve as a guidance for future simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Numerical insights on the volume phase transition of thermoresponsive hollow microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hollow microgels, consisting of a pNIPAM polymer network with a central cavity, have significant potential due to their tunable softness and encapsulation capabilities. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we thoroughly characterise the swelling behaviour of neutral hollow microgels across the Volume Phase Transition (VPT) upon varying crosslinker concentration, shell thickness, and size. In particular, we examine in detail the onset of cavity filling and its relation to the VPT, detecting the presence of a discontinuity in the radius of gyration of the microgels, if an appropriate balance between shell stiffness and thermoresposiveness is reached. The discontinuity is, however, absent in the behaviour of the hydrodynamic radius, in agreement with experimental observations. We then test our numerical model by direct comparison of form factors with available measurements in the literature and also establish a minimal-size, stable hollow microgel for future computationally feasible bulk investigations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental swelling properties of hollow microgels that can be useful to control the opening and closing of the cavity for application purposes.</description>
