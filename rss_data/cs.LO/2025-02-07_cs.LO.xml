      <title>POPACheck: a Model Checker for probabilistic Pushdown Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present POPACheck, the first full-fledged model checking tool for pPDA. POPACheck provides a user-friendly probabilistic modeling language with recursion that automatically translates into pOPA. pOPA are a class of pPDA that can express all the behaviors of probabilistic programs. On pOPA, POPACheck can solve reachability queries as well as qualitative and quantitative model checking queries for specifications in LTL and a fragment of POTL, a logic for context-free properties such as pre/post-conditioning.</description>

      <title>Partial Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce partial Markov categories as a synthetic framework for synthetic probabilistic inference, blending the work of Cho and Jacobs, Fritz, and Golubtsov on Markov categories with the work of Cockett and Lack on cartesian restriction categories. We describe observations, Bayes' theorem, normalisation, and both Pearl's and Jeffrey's updates in purely categorical terms.</description>

      <title>Strong Equivalence in Answer Set Programming with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of strong equivalence within the extended framework of Answer Set Programming with constraints. Two groups of rules are considered strongly equivalent if, informally speaking, they have the same meaning in any context. We demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, strong equivalence between rule sets in this extended setting can be precisely characterized by their equivalence in the logic of Here-and-There with constraints. Furthermore, we present a translation from the language of several clingo-based answer set solvers that handle constraints into the language of Here-and-There with constraints. This translation enables us to leverage the logic of Here-and-There to reason about strong equivalence within the context of these solvers. We also explore the computational complexity of determining strong equivalence in this context.</description>

      <title>Relational Connectors and Heterogeneous Bisimulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While behavioural equivalences among systems of the same type, such as Park/Milner bisimilarity of labelled transition systems, are an established notion, a systematic treatment of relationships between systems of different type is currently missing. We provide such a treatment in the framework of universal coalgebra, in which the type of a system (nondeterministic, probabilistic, weighted, game-based etc.) is abstracted as a set functor: We introduce relational connectors among set functors, which induce notions of heterogeneous (bi)simulation among coalgebras of the respective types. We give a number of constructions on relational connectors. In particular, we identify composition and converse operations on relational connectors; we construct corresponding identity relational connectors, showing that the latter generalize the standard Barr extension of weak-pullback-preserving functors; and we introduce a Kantorovich construction in which relational connectors are induced from relations between modalities. For Kantorovich relational connectors, one has a notion of dual-purpose modal logic interpreted over both system types, and we prove a corresponding Hennessy-Milner-type theorem stating that generalized (bi)similarity coincides with theory inclusion on finitely-branching systems. We apply these results to a number of example scenarios involving labelled transition systems with different label alphabets, probabilistic systems, and input/output conformances.</description>

      <title>On the Existential Theory of the Reals Enriched with Integer Powers of a Computable Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates ER(r^Z), that is the extension of the existential theory of the reals by an additional unary predicate r^Z for the integer powers of a fixed computable real number r &gt; 0. If all we have access to is a Turing machine computing r, it is not possible to decide whether an input formula from this theory satisfiable. However, we show an algorithm to decide this problem when: 1. r is known to be transcendental, or 2. r is a root of some given integer polynomial (that is, r is algebraic).
  In other words, knowing the algebraicity of r suffices to circumvent undecidability. Furthermore, we establish complexity results under the proviso that r enjoys what we call a polynomial root barrier. Using this notion, we show that the satisfiability problem of ER(r^Z) is 1. in EXPSPACE if r is an algebraic number, and 2. in 3EXP if r is a logarithm of an algebraic number, Euler's e, or the number pi, among others.
  To establish our results, we first observe that the satisfiability problem of ER(r^Z) reduces in exponential time to the problem of solving quantifier-free instances of the theory of the reals where variables range over r^Z. We then prove that these instances have a small witness property: only finitely many integer powers of r must be considered to find whether a formula is satisfiable. Our complexity results are shown by relying on well-established machinery from Diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory, such as bounds for the transcendence measure of numbers.
  As a by-product of our results, we are able to remove the appeal to Schanuel's conjecture from the proof of decidability of the entropic risk threshold problem for stochastic games with rational probabilities, rewards and threshold [Baier et al., MFCS'23]: when the base of the entropic risk is Euler's e and the aversion factor is a fixed algebraic number, the problem is in EXP.</description>
