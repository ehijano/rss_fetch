      <title>On the quasi-similarity of operators with flag structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote by the operator class with some proper conditions. %satisfying that for any two operators $T,\tilde{T}$ in $\mathcal{A}$, the non-zero intertwining operator between $T$ and $\tilde{T}$ has dense range. Then by taking the operators in $\mathcal{A}$ as atoms and using the flag structure as bondings, we introduce a new operator class. For operators with certain properties in this new class, we prove that the operator matrix of the intertwining operator is of the upper-triangular form. According to this critical result, we firstly show that the strongly irreducible operators in the new class preserve strong irreducibility under quasi-similarity, which gives a partial answer to the question proposed by C.L. Jiang. Also, when $\mathcal{A}$ is backward weighted shift operators class, we prove that the quasi-similarity between operators in the new class implies the similarity relation, which partially answers the question proposed by D.A. Herrero. Finally, we describe some properties of intertwining operators in term of geometric language.</description>

      <title>Luh hypercyclic vector for composition operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the construction of holomorphic functions on a simply connected domain satisfying that all its derivatives and antiderivatives under a composition operator have a dense orbit. Such functions will be called Luh hypercyclic vectors for the respective composition operator. We show that there is a dense linear manifold of Luh hypercyclic vectors. Moreover, we study the dynamics of cosine operator function generated by weighted composition operators on solid Banach function spaces, in particular on Orlicz and Morrey spaces, and we give sufficient conditions for supercyclicity of such cosine operator functions in terms of the corresponding weight function. Also, we give concrete examples of weighted translations satisfying these sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Variational Seasonal-Trend Decomposition with Sparse Continuous-Domain Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of recovering a continuous-domain function from a finite number of noisy linear measurements. The unknown signal is modeled as the sum of a slowly varying trend and a periodic or quasi-periodic seasonal component. We formulate a variational framework for their joint recovery by introducing convex regularizations based on generalized total variation, which promote sparsity in spline-like representations. Our analysis is conducted in an infinite-dimensional setting and leads to a representer theorem showing that minimizers are splines in both components. To make the approach numerically feasible, we introduce a family of discrete approximations and prove their convergence to the original problem in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence. This further ensures the uniform convergence of discrete solutions to their continuous counterparts. The proposed framework offers a principled approach to seasonal-trend decomposition in the presence of noise and limited measurements, with theoretical guarantees on both representation and discretization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a general form of Wiener's lemma for measures on locally compact abelian (LCA) groups by using Fourier analysis and the theory of F{{\o}}lner sequences. Our approach provides a unified framework that that encompasses both the discrete and continuous cases. We also show a version of Wiener's lemma for Bochner-Riesz means on both R^d and T^d .

      <title>Korevaar-Schoen and heat kernel characterizations of Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees which are metric spaces locally isometric to real trees. Such spaces are equipped with a Radon measure satisfying a locally uniform volume growth condition. Using the intrinsic geodesic structure, we define weak gradients and develop from it a coherent theory of Sobolev and BV spaces. We provide two main characterizations: one via Korevaar-Schoen-type energy functionals and another via the heat kernel associated with the natural Dirichlet form. Applications include interpolation results for Besov-Lipschitz spaces, critical exponents computations, and a Nash inequality. In globally tree-like settings we also establish $L^p$ gradient bounds for the heat semigroup.</description>

      <title>Analysis of non-linear fractal functions on PCF self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with (1) the construction of a general non-linear fractal interpolation function on PCF self-similar sets, (2) the energy and normal derivatives of uniform non-linear fractal functions, (3) estimation of the bound of box dimension of the proposed fractal functions on the Sierpinski gasket and the von-Koch curve. Here, we present a more general framework to construct the attractor and the functions on the PCF self-similar sets using the Edelstein contraction, which broadens the class of functions. En route, we calculate the upper and lower box dimensions of the graph of non-linear interpolant. Finally, we provide several graphical and numerical examples for illustration of the construction and estimate the dimensions for different data sets.</description>

      <title>Which hyponormal block Toeplitz operators are either normal or analytic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue Curto-Hwang-Lee's work to study the connection between hyponormality and subnormality for block Toeplitz operators acting on the vector-valued Hardy space of the unit circle. Curto-Hwang-Lee's work focuses primarily on hyponormality and subnormality of block Toeplitz operators with rational symbols. By studying the greatest common divisor of matrix-valued inner functions and the ``weak" commutativity of matrix-valued inner functions, we extended Curto-Hwang-Lee's result to block Toeplitz operators with symbols of bounded type. More precisely, we proved that if $\Psi,\Psi^{\ast}$ are matrix-valued functions of bounded type and the inner part of $\Psi$ of Douglas-Shapiro-Shields factorization is a scalar inner function, then every hyponormal Toeplitz operator $T_{\Psi}$ whose square is also hyponormal must be either normal or analytic.</description>

Abstract: Suppose $\Sigma$ is a topological space and $S(\Sigma)$ is the vector lattice of all equivalent classes of continuous real-valued functions defined on open dense subsets of $\Sigma$. In this paper, we establish some lattice and topological aspects of $S(\Sigma)$. In particular, as an application, we show that the unbounded order convergence and the order convergence are stable under passing to the Fremlin tensor product of two Archimedean vector lattices.</description>

      <title>Weighted theory of Toeplitz operators on the Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the weighted compactness and boundedness of Toeplitz operators on the Fock spaces. Fix $\alpha&gt;0$. Let $T_{\varphi}$ be the Toeplitz operator on the Fock space $F^2_{\alpha}$ over $\mathbb{C}^n$ with symbol $\varphi\in L^{\infty}$. For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and any finite sum $T$ of finite products of Toeplitz operators $T_{\varphi}$'s, we show that $T$ is compact on the weighted Fock space $F^p_{\alpha,w}$ if and only if its Berezin transform vanishes at infinity, where $w$ is a restricted $A_p$-weight on $\mathbb{C}^n$. Concerning boundedness, for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, we characterize the $r$-doubling weights $w$ such that $T_{\varphi}$ is bounded on the weighted spaces $L^p_{\alpha,w}$ via a $\varphi$-adapted $A_p$-type condition. Our method also establishes a two weight inequality for the Fock projections in the case of $r$-doubling weights. Moreover, we characterize the corresponding weighted compactness of Bergman--Toeplitz operators, which answers a question raised by Stockdale and Wagner [Math. Z. 305 (2023), no. 1, Paper No. 10].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} model theory says that there is a bijection between the class of purely contractive analytic functions and the class of completely non-unitary (c.n.u.) contractions modulo unitary equivalence. In this paper we provide a complete classification of the purely contractive analytic functions such that the associated contraction is a c.n.u. power partial isometry. As an application of our findings, we determine a class of contractive polynomials such that the associated c.n.u. power partial isometry is of the explicit diagonal form $S \oplus N \oplus C$, where $S$ and $C^*$ are unilateral shifts and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we obtain a characterization of operator-valued symbols for which the corresponding Toeplitz operator on vector-valued Hardy space is a partial isometry.</description>

      <title>Decay rates given by regularly varying functions for $C_0$-semigroups on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rates of decay for (possibly unbounded) $C_0$-semigroups on Banach spaces under the assumption that the norm of the resolvent of the respective semigroup generator grows as a regularly varying function of type $\beta&gt;0$, that is, as $|s|^{\beta}\ell(1+|s|)$ or $|s|^{\beta}/\kappa(1+|s|)$, where $\ell,\kappa$ are arbitrary monotone and slowly varying functions. The main result extends the estimates obtained by Deng, Rozendaal and Veraar (J. Evol. Equ. 24, 99 (2024)) to this setting of regularly varying functions and improves the estimates obtained by Santana and Carvalho (J. Evol. Equ. 24, 28 (2024)) in case $|s|^{\beta}\log(1+|s|)^b$, with $b\ge 0$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, by introducing some parameters, we define and study certain $p$-adic Hardy-Littlewood-P\'{o}lya-type integral operators acting on $p$-adic weighted Lebesgue spaces. We completely characterize the boundedness of these operators in terms of the parameters. For some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for the operators. These results are not only a complement to some previous results but also an extension of existing ones in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop criteria to guarantee uniqueness of the C$^*$-norm on a *-algebra $\mathcal{B}$. Nontrivial examples are provided by the noncommutative algebras of $\mathcal{C}$-valued functions $\mathcal{S}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ defined by M.A. Rieffel via a deformation quantization procedure, where $\mathcal{C}$ is a C$^*$-algebra and $J$ is a skew-symmetric linear transformation on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with respect to which the usual pointwise product is deformed. In the process, we prove that the Fr\'echet *-algebra topology of $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ can be generated by a sequence of submultiplicative *-norms and that, if $\mathcal{C}$ is unital, this algebra is closed under the C$^\infty$-functional calculus of its C$^*$-completion. We also show that the algebras $\mathcal{S}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are spectrally invariant in their respective C$^*$-completions, when $\mathcal{C}$ is unital. As a corollary of our results, we obtain simple proofs of certain estimates in $\mathcal{B}_J^\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.</description>

Abstract: Given a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a result by Bourgain, Brezis, and Mironescu characterizes when a function $f \in L^p(\Omega)$ is in the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ based on the limiting behavior of its Besov seminorms. We prove a direct analogue of this result which characterizes when a differential $k$-form $\omega \in L^p(\wedge^k T^* \Omega)$ has a weak exterior derivative $d\omega \in L^p(\wedge^{k+1} T^* \Omega)$, where the analogue of the Besov seminorm that our result uses is based on integration over simplices.</description>

      <title>Stein-Weiss, and power weight Korn type Hardy-Sobolev Inequalities in $L^1$ norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the $L^1$ Stein-Weiss inequalities studied by De N\'{a}poli and Picon [4] in two ways: First we address an open question posed by the authors about whether the cocanceling condition was necessary for some of their Stein-Weiss inequalities. We replace the cocanceling condition with a weaker vanishing moment assumption, and under this assumption extend the $L^1$ Stein-Weiss inequalities to $L^1(|x|^{a } dx)$ data for all positive, non-integer exponents $a$. Second, in relation to integer exponents, while [4] showed that Stein-Weiss fails for $L^1(|x| dx)$ data, we prove a weaker Korn type Hardy-Sobolev inequality. These inequalities were previously inaccessible due to the growth of $|x|$, and we demonstrate a specific example on $\mathbb{R}^2$ of where the original duality estimate by Bousquet and Van Schaftingen [2] for canceling operators can be improved.</description>
