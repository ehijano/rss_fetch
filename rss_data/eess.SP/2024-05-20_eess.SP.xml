      <title>Detecting 5G Signal Jammers Using Spectrograms with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular networks are potential targets of jamming attacks to disrupt wireless communications. Since the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks enables mission-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or smart manufacturing, the resulting malfunctions can cause serious damage. This paper proposes to detect broadband jammers by an online classification of spectrograms. These spectrograms are computed from a stream of in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples of 5G radio signals. We obtain these signals experimentally and describe how to design a suitable dataset for training. Based on this data, we compare two classification methods: a supervised learning model built on a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) and an unsupervised learning model based on a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). After comparing the structure of these models, their performance is assessed in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Flexible Beamforming for Movable Antenna-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates flexible beamforming design in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network with movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system, with the base station (BS) equipped with MAs. This enables array response reconfiguration by adjusting the positions of antennas. Thus, a joint beamforming and antenna position optimization problem, namely flexible beamforming, is proposed to maximize communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI). The fractional programming (FP) method is adopted to transform the non-convex objective function, and we alternatively update the beamforming matrix and antenna positions. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are employed to derive the close-form solution of the beamforming matrix, while we propose an efficient search-based projected gradient ascent (SPGA) method to update the antenna positions. Simulation results demonstrate that MAs significantly enhance the ISAC performance when employing our proposed algorithm, achieving a 59.8% performance gain compared to fixed uniform arrays.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the Feedforward Multichannel Virtual Sensing Active Noise Control (MVANC) by Using MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multichannel virtual sensing active noise control (MVANC) methodology is an advanced approach that may provide a wide area of silence at specific virtual positions that are distant from the physical error microphones. Currently, there is a scarcity of open-source programs available for the MVANC algorithm. This work presents a MATLAB code for the MVANC approach, utilizing the multichannel filtered-x least mean square (MCFxLMS) algorithm. The code is designed to be applicable to systems with any number of channels. The code can be found on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Dual-Robust Integrated Sensing and Communication: Beamforming under CSI Imperfection and Location Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dual-robust design of beamforming is investigated in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system.Existing research on robust ISAC waveform design, while proposing solutions to imperfect channel state information (CSI), generally depends on prior knowledge of the target's approximate location to design waveforms. This approach, however, limits the precision in sensing the target's exact location. In this paper, considering both CSI imperfection and target location uncertainty, a novel framework of joint robust optimization is proposed by maximizing the weighted sum of worst-case data rate and beampattern gain. To address this challenging problem, we propose an efficient two-layer iteration algorithm based on S-Procedure and convex hull. Finally, numerical results verify the effectiveness and performance improvement of our dual-robust algorithm, as well as the trade-off between communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Radar Positioning for Accurate Sensing of Pulse Waves at Multiple Sites Using a 3D Human Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a sensing method using a millimeter-wave array radar and a depth camera to measure pulse waves at multiple sites on the human body. Using a three-dimensional shape model of the target human body measured by the depth camera, the method identifies reflection sites on the body through electromagnetic scattering simulation. On the basis of the simulation, the radar system can be positioned at a suitable location for measuring pulse waves depending on the posture of the target person. Through measurements using radar and depth camera systems, we demonstrate that the proposed method can estimate the body displacement waveform caused by pulse waves accurately, improving the accuracy by 14% compared with a conventional approach without a depth camera. The proposed method can be a key to realizing an accurate and noncontact sensor for monitoring blood pressure.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Trade-off in ISAC Systems: The KL Divergence Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a promising technique for 6G communication network. In this letter, we investigate the Pareto bound of the ISAC system in terms of a unified Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence performance metric. We firstly present the relationship between KL divergence and explicit ISAC performance metric, i.e., demodulation error and probability of detection. Thereafter, we investigate the impact of constellation and beamforming design on the Pareto bound via deep learning and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Simulation results show the trade-off between sensing and communication performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and probability of detection under different parameter set-ups.</description>

      <title>Carrier Aggregation Enabled MIMO-OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolution towards the forthcoming era of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems characterized by ubiquitous intelligence, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is in a phase of burgeoning development. However, the capabilities of communication and sensing within single frequency band fall short of meeting the escalating demands. To this end, this paper introduces a carrier aggregation (CA)- enabled multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) ISAC system fusing the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands by symbol-level fusion for ultimate communication experience and high-accuracy sensing. The challenges in sensing signal processing introduced by CA include the initial phase misalignment of the echo signals on high and low-frequency bands due to attenuation and radar cross section, and the fusion of the sensing data on high and lowfrequency bands with different physical-layer parameters. To this end, the sensing signal processing is decomposed into two stages. In the first stage, the problem of initial phase misalignment of the echo signals on high and low-frequency bands is solved by the angle compensation, space-domain diversity and vector crosscorrelation operations. In the second stage, this paper realizes symbol-level fusion of the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands through sensing vector rearrangement and cyclic prefix adjustment operations, thereby obtaining high-precision sensing performance. Then, the closed-form communication mutual information (MI) and sensing Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the proposed ISAC system are derived to explore the theoretical performance bound with CA. Simulation results validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Recovery of Sparse Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the recovery of a node-domain sparse graph signal from the output of a graph filter. This problem, often referred to as the identification of the source of a diffused sparse graph signal, is seminal in the field of graph signal processing (GSP). Sparse graph signals can be used in the modeling of a variety of real-world applications in networks, such as social, biological, and power systems, and enable various GSP tasks, such as graph signal reconstruction, blind deconvolution, and sampling. In this paper, we assume double sparsity of both the graph signal and the graph topology, as well as a low-order graph filter. We propose three algorithms to reconstruct the support set of the input sparse graph signal from the graph filter output samples, leveraging these assumptions and the generalized information criterion (GIC). First, we describe the graph multiple GIC (GM-GIC) method, which is based on partitioning the dictionary elements (graph filter matrix columns) that capture information on the signal into smaller subsets. Then, the local GICs are computed for each subset and aggregated to make a global decision. Second, inspired by the well-known branch and bound (BNB) approach, we develop the graph-based branch and bound GIC (graph-BNB-GIC), and incorporate a new tractable heuristic bound tailored to the graph and graph filter characteristics. Finally, we propose the graph-based first order correction (GFOC) method, which improves existing sparse recovery methods by iteratively examining potential improvements to the GIC cost function through replacing elements from the estimated support set with elements from their one-hop neighborhood. We conduct simulations that demonstrate that the proposed sparse recovery methods outperform existing methods in terms of support set recovery accuracy, and without a significant computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Universal Joint Source-Channel Coding for Modulation-Agnostic Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of joint source-channel coding (JSCC), there has been significant research on utilizing semantic communication, which inherently possesses analog characteristics, within digital device environments. However, a single-model approach that operates modulation-agnostically across various digital modulation orders has not yet been established. This article presents the first attempt at such an approach by proposing a universal joint source-channel coding (uJSCC) system that utilizes a single-model encoder-decoder pair and trained vector quantization (VQ) codebooks. To support various modulation orders within a single model, the operation of every neural network (NN)-based module in the uJSCC system requires the selection of modulation orders according to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boundaries. To address the challenge of unequal output statistics from shared parameters across NN layers, we integrate multiple batch normalization (BN) layers, selected based on modulation order, after each NN layer. This integration occurs with minimal impact on the overall model size. Through a comprehensive series of experiments, we validate that this modulation-agnostic semantic communication framework demonstrates superiority over existing digital semantic communication approaches in terms of model complexity, communication efficiency, and task effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Impulsive Interference in Digital Audio Broadcasting Systems in Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, new types of interference in electric vehicles (EVs), such as converters switching and/or battery chargers, have been found to degrade the performance of wireless digital transmission systems. Measurements show that such an interference is characterized by impulsive behavior and is widely varying in time. This paper uses recorded data from our EV testbed to analyze the impulsive interference in the digital audio broadcasting band. Moreover, we use our analysis to obtain a corresponding interference model. In particular, we studied the temporal characteristics of the interference and confirmed that its amplitude indeed exhibits an impulsive behavior. Our results show that impulsive events span successive received signal samples and thus indicate a bursty nature. To this end, we performed a data-driven modification of a well-established model for bursty impulsive interference, the Markov-Middleton model, to produce synthetic noise realization. We investigate the optimal symbol detector design based on the proposed model and show significant performance gains compared to the conventional detector based on the additive white Gaussian noise assumption.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) utilizes a compact antenna array to form a nearly continuous aperture, thereby enhancing higher capacity and more flexible configurations compared with conventional MIMO systems, making it attractive in current scientific research. Key questions naturally arise regarding the potential of HMIMO to surpass Shannon's theoretical limits and how far its capabilities can be extended. However, the traditional Shannon information theory falls short in addressing these inquiries because it only focuses on the information itself while neglecting the underlying carrier, electromagnetic (EM) waves, and environmental interactions. To fill up the gap between the theoretical analysis and the practical application for HMIMO systems, we introduce electromagnetic information theory (EIT) in this paper. This paper begins by laying the foundation for HMIMO-oriented EIT, encompassing EM wave equations and communication regions. In the context of HMIMO systems, the resultant physical limitations are presented, involving Chu's limit, Harrington's limit, Hannan's limit, and the evaluation of coupling effects. Field sampling and HMIMO-assisted oversampling are also discussed to guide the optimal HMIMO design within the EIT framework. To comprehensively depict the EM-compliant propagation process, we present the approximate and exact channel modeling approaches in near-/far-field zones. Furthermore, we discuss both traditional Shannon's information theory, employing the probabilistic method, and Kolmogorov information theory, utilizing the functional analysis, for HMIMO-oriented EIT systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices: An MDP Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) requires edge devices to perform local training and exchange information with a parameter server, leading to substantial energy consumption. A critical challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid energy depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which curtails their operational lifespan and affects the learning performance. To address this issue, we apply energy harvesting technique in FL systems to extract ambient energy for continuously powering edge devices. We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is impacted by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states. To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve the secrecy communication performance of wireless users, it still faces challenges such as limited coverage and double-fading effect. To address these issues, in this paper, we utilize a novel multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless users, and investigate the physical layer secrecy problem in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy throughput of users in the MF-RIS-assisted NOMA networks with external and internal eavesdroppers. The asymptotic expressions for SOP and secrecy diversity order are also analyzed under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additionally, we examine the impact of receiver hardware limitations and error transmission-induced imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the secrecy performance. Numerical results indicate that: i) under the same power budget, the secrecy performance achieved by MF-RIS significantly outperforms active RIS and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS; ii) with increasing power budget, residual interference caused by imperfect SIC surpasses thermal noise as the primary factor affecting secrecy capacity; and iii) deploying additional elements at the MF-RIS brings significant secrecy enhancements for the external eavesdropping scenario, in contrast to the internal eavesdropping case.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Super Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, which demand ultra high data rates, this study introduces the concept of super constellation communications. Also, we present super amplitude phase shift keying (SAPSK), an innovative modulation technique designed to achieve these ultra high data rate demands. SAPSK is complemented by the generalized polar distance detector (GPD-D), which approximates the optimal maximum likelihood detector in channels with Gaussian phase noise (GPN). By leveraging the decision regions formulated by GPD-D, a tight closed-form approximation for the symbol error probability (SEP) of SAPSK constellations is derived, while a detection algorithm with O(1) time complexity is developed to ensure fast and efficient SAPSK symbol detection. Finally, the theoretical performance of SAPSK and the efficiency of the proposed O(1) algorithm are validated by numerical simulations, highlighting both its superiority in terms of SEP compared to various constellations and its practical advantages in terms of fast and accurate symbol detection.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Symbol Detection for Intersymbol Interference Channels with Bursty Impulsive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed machine learning approaches for data-driven trellis-based soft symbol detection in coded transmission over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels in presence of bursty impulsive noise (IN), for example encountered in wireless digital broadcasting systems and vehicular communications. This enabled us to obtain optimized detectors based on the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm while circumventing the use of full channel state information (CSI) for computing likelihoods and trellis state transition probabilities. First, we extended the application of the neural network (NN)-aided BCJR, recently proposed for ISI channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Although suitable for estimating likelihoods via labeling of transmission sequences, the BCJR-NN method does not provide a framework for learning the trellis state transitions. In addition to detection over the joint ISI and IN states we also focused on another scenario where trellis transitions are not trivial: detection for the ISI channel with AWGN with inaccurate knowledge of the channel memory at the receiver. Without access to the accurate state transition matrix, the BCJR- NN performance significantly degrades in both settings. To this end, we devised an alternative approach for data-driven BCJR detection based on the unsupervised learning of a hidden Markov model (HMM). The BCJR-HMM allowed us to optimize both the likelihood function and the state transition matrix without labeling. Moreover, we demonstrated the viability of a hybrid NN and HMM BCJR detection where NN is used for learning the likelihoods, while the state transitions are optimized via HMM. While reducing the required prior channel knowledge, the examined data-driven detectors with learned trellis state transitions achieve bit error rates close to the optimal full CSI-based BCJR, significantly outperforming detection with inaccurate CSI.</description>

      <title>Explainable Semantic Communication for Text Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication has gained increasing attention due to its ability to reduce the amount of transmitted data without sacrificing task performance. Although some prior efforts have been dedicated to developing semantic communications, the semantics in these works remains to be unexplainable. Challenges related to explainable semantic representation and knowledge-based semantic compression have yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose a triplet-based explainable semantic communication (TESC) scheme for representing text semantics efficiently. Specifically, we develop a semantic extraction method to convert text into triplets while using syntactic dependency analysis to enhance semantic completeness. Then, we design a semantic filtering method to further compress the duplicate and task-irrelevant triplets based on prior knowledge. The filtered triplets are encoded and transmitted to the receiver for completing intelligent tasks. Furthermore, we apply the propsed TESC scheme to two emblematic text tasks: sentiment analysis and question answering, in which the semantic codec is meticulously customized for each task. Experimental results demonstrate that 1) TESC scheme outperforms benchmarks in terms of Top-1 accuracy and transmission efficiency, and 2) TESC scheme enjoys about 150% performance gain compared to the traditional communication method.</description>

      <title>Exploring new territory: Calibration-free decoding for c-VEP BCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores two zero-training methods aimed at enhancing the usability of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) by eliminating the need for a calibration session. We introduce a novel method rooted in the event-related potential (ERP) domain, unsupervised mean maximization (UMM), to the fast code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP) stimulus protocol. We compare UMM to the state-of-the-art c-VEP zero-training method that uses canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The comparison includes instantaneous classification and classification with cumulative learning from previously classified trials for both CCA and UMM. Our study shows the effectiveness of both methods in navigating the complexities of a c-VEP dataset, highlighting their differences and distinct strengths. This research not only provides insights into the practical implementation of calibration-free BCI methods but also paves the way for further exploration and refinement. Ultimately, the fusion of CCA and UMM holds promise for enhancing the accessibility and usability of BCI systems across various application domains and a multitude of stimulus protocols.</description>

      <title>Towards Bi-Hemispheric Emotion Mapping through EEG: A Dual-Stream Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion classification through EEG signals plays a significant role in psychology, neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. This paper addresses the challenge of mapping human emotions using EEG data in the Mapping Human Emotions through EEG Signals FG24 competition. Subjects mimic the facial expressions of an avatar, displaying fear, joy, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise in a VR setting. EEG data is captured using a multi-channel sensor system to discern brain activity patterns. We propose a novel two-stream neural network employing a Bi-Hemispheric approach for emotion inference, surpassing baseline methods and enhancing emotion recognition accuracy. Additionally, we conduct a temporal analysis revealing that specific signal intervals at the beginning and end of the emotion stimulus sequence contribute significantly to improve accuracy. Leveraging insights gained from this temporal analysis, our approach offers enhanced performance in capturing subtle variations in the states of emotions.</description>

      <title>Underdetermined DOA Estimation of Off-Grid Sources Based on the Generalized Double Pareto Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a new generalized double Pareto based on off-grid sparse Bayesian learning (GDPOGSBL) approach to improve the performance of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in underdetermined scenarios. The method aims to enhance the sparsity of source signal by utilizing the generalized double Pareto (GDP) prior. Firstly, we employ a first-order linear Taylor expansion to model the real array manifold matrix, and Bayesian inference is utilized to calculate the off-grid error, which mitigates the grid dictionary mismatch problem in underdetermined scenarios. Secondly, an innovative grid refinement method is introduced, treating grid points as iterative parameters to minimize the modeling error between the source and grid points. The numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed strategy, especially when dealing with a coarse grid and few snapshots.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance Evaluation of SEANet, a Software-defined Networking Platform for the Internet of Underwater Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of the SEANet platform, a software-defined acoustic modem designed for enhancing underwater networking and Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications. Addressing the limitations of traditional acoustic modems, which suffer from low data rates and rigid architectures, SEANet introduces a versatile, adaptive framework capable of reconfiguring all layers of the protocol stack in real-time to accommodate diverse marine applications. The platform integrates high-performance, wideband data converters with modular hardware and software components, enabling real-time adaptation to changing environmental and operational conditions. Experimental evaluations conducted in oceanic settings demonstrate the SEANet capability to significantly exceed the performance of existing commercial underwater modems, supporting data rates up to 150 kbit/s and effectively doubling the performance metrics of conventional systems. Our robust testing also highlights the SEANet proficiency in channel estimation, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) link establishment, and interoperability through the JANUS communication standard. Our results underscore the SEANet potential to transform underwater communication technologies, providing a scalable and efficient solution that supports high data rate applications and fosters the expansion of IoUT deployments.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming with Gradient-based Liquid Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication with the advanced beamforming technologies is a key enabler to meet the growing demands of future mobile communication. However, the dynamic nature of cellular channels in large-scale urban mmWave MIMO communication scenarios brings substantial challenges, particularly in terms of complexity and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a robust gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) framework that utilizes ordinary differential equation-based liquid neurons to solve the beamforming problem. Specifically, our proposed GLNN framework takes gradients of the optimization objective function as inputs to extract the high-order channel feature information, and then introduces a residual connection to mitigate the training burden. Furthermore, we use the manifold learning technique to compress the search space of the beamforming problem. These designs enable the GLNN to effectively maintain low complexity while ensuring strong robustness to noisy and highly dynamic channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the GLNN can achieve 4.15% higher spectral efficiency than that of typical iterative algorithms, and reduce the time consumption to only 1.61% that of conventional methods.</description>
