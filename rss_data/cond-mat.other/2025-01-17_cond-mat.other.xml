      <title>Supersolid dipolar phases in planar geometry: effects of tilted polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in planar geometries is investigated, focusing on the effects of the polarization orientation. While perpendicular polarization produces a phase diagram with hexagonal, stripes, and honeycomb phases ending at a single critical point, the presence of an in-plane polarization component transforms the critical point into three critical lines, separating two phases at a time and changing radically the appearance of the phase diagram. All transition lines contain first- and second-order regions, while the phase diagram itself shows a resemblance with those displayed by quasi-one-dimensional dipolar systems. Finally, we investigate the effect of introducing an in-plane polarization on the structural properties of the phases and determine the superfluid fraction. Our results show that this process induces an axial deformation on the hexagonal and honeycomb phases, resulting in an anisotropic behavior in the long distance properties of the system like superfluidity. We expect that the rich phenomenology observed provides motivation for new experiments and theoretical works.</description>

      <title>Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <title>High-Q cavity coupled to a high permittivity dielectric resonator for sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of high quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$-factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) SrTiO$_3$ puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility to tune the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow one to investigate the dependence of the zero transmission frequency value on changes of the permittivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. Finally, we discuss a specific application of the coupled system as a bolometer in different temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>Threetangle in the XY-model class with a non-integrable field background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The square root of the threetangle is calculated for the transverse XY-model with an integrability-breaking in-plane field component. To be in a regime of quasi-solvability of the convex roof, here we concentrate here on a 4-site model Hamiltonian. In general, the field and hence a mixing of the odd/even sectors, has a detrimental effect on the threetangle, as expected. Only in a particular spot of models with no or weak inhomogeneity $\gamma$ does a finite value of the tangle prevail in a broad maximum region of the field strength $h\approx 0.3\pm 0.1$. There, the threetangle is basically independent of the non-zero angle $\alpha$. This system could be experimentally used as a quasi-pure source of threetangled states or as an entanglement triggered switch depending on the experimental error in the field orientation.</description>
