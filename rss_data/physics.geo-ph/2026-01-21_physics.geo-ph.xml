      <title>The use of spectral indices in environmental monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11603v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study aimed to evaluate the applicability of environmental indices in the monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps. A dump located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin served as the research site for a multi-method analysis combining remote sensing and field-based data. Two UAV survey campaigns were conducted, capturing RGB, infrared, and multispectral imagery. These were supplemented with direct ground measurements of subsurface temperature and detailed vegetation mapping. Additionally, publicly available satellite data from the Landsat and Sentinel missions were analysed. A range of vegetation and fire-related indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, BAI, among others) were calculated to identify thermally active zones and assess vegetation conditions within these degraded areas. The results revealed strong seasonal variability in vegetation indices on thermally active sites, with evidence of disrupted vegetation cycles, including winter greening in moderately heated root zones - a pattern indicative of stress and degradation processes. While satellite data proved useful in reconstructing the fire history of the dump, their spatial resolution was insufficient for detailed monitoring of small-scale thermal anomalies. The study highlights the diagnostic potential of UAV-based remote sensing in post-industrial environments undergoing land degradation but emphasises the importance of field validation for accurate environmental assessment.</description>

      <title>A stable hothouse triggered by a tipping mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The climate system's nonlinear dynamics is influenced by various external forcings and internal feedbacks that can give rise to regional and even global tipping points that may lead to significant and potentially irreversible changes. Paleoclimatic records reveal that Earth's climate has shifted between distinct equlibria, including a "hothouse Earth" state with temperatures about 10 K higher than present. However, a specific mechanism for a sudden tipping to an alternate stable state, several degrees warmer than the present climate, has yet to be presented. We introduce a temperature-carbon-vegetation (TCV) model comprising an energy balance model of global temperature, coupled with global terrestrial and ocean CO2 dynamics, and with vegetation ecosystem change. Our model exhibits a new tipping mechanism that leads to a hothouse Earth under a high-emissions scenario. Its simulations align with both observations and IPCC-class global climate models prior to tipping. The two processes that produce global tipping are: (i) temperature-albedo feedback due to darkening of the terrestrial cryosphere by glacial microalgae; and (ii) limits to vegetation adaptation that lead to reduced carbon absorption.</description>

      <title>On the concentration distribution in turbulent thermals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent thermals emerge in a wide variety of geophysical and industrial flows, such as atmospheric cumulus convection and pollutant dispersal in oceans and lakes. When a buoyant fluid mass rises, or sinks, heat and mass transfers occur by the engulfment of the fresh surrounding fluid inside the thermal - a process that spans over multiple scales from macroscopic entrainment of ambient fluid to microscopic diffusive processes. Turbulent thermals are typically investigated through their integral properties (radius, depth, entrainment rate). However, mixing processes depend on the internal distribution of concentration or temperature inside a thermal, which remains poorly constrained. Here, we use laboratory fluid dynamics experiments and direct numerical simulations to investigate the mixing of a passive scalar in turbulent thermals with large Reynolds numbers. We track the evolution of the concentration field, computing its moments and the probability density function. The concentration distribution exhibits self-similarity over time, except at high concentrations, possibly because of the presence of undiluted cores. These distributions are well approximated by an exponential probability density function. Although diffusion has a strong effect on the spatial structure of the concentration field, we observe no significant effect of diffusivity on the concentration distributions in the investigated range of Peclet numbers.</description>
