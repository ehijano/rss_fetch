      <title>G\"{o}del-symmetric backgrounds and explicit spacetime symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry with nondynamical background fields in gravitational theories can lead to inconsistencies between the equations of motion and the underlying pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the St\"{u}ckelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the G\"{o}del metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields. This dependence allows for the emergence of both causal and non-causal regions in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Branch structure and nonextensive thermodynamics of Kalb-Ramond-ModMax black holes: observational signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole arising in Einstein gravity coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field and ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics, both of which are independently well motivated extensions of standard electrovacuum gravity. The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $\zeta=\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing, photon propagation in plasma, and tidal forces are then studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches. In particular, the ordinary branch exhibits finite-radius tidal inversion, absent in the phantom sector. Our results demonstrate that the combined Kalb-Ramond and ModMax effects lead to a rich and observationally distinguishable black-hole phenomenology.</description>

      <title>General Scalar Field Inflation ACT Attractors: Utilizing the $n_s(r)$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ACT data have severely constrained the single scalar field models. Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2\sigma$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-\alpha r^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=\gamma \pm \beta r \pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data.</description>

      <title>A Remedy of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with Smooth Slow-roll to Power-law Inflation Transitions in Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that if the standard slow-roll inflation is followed by a power-law inflationary regime, then the trans-Planckian modes may be safely be contained in the Hubble horizon and never exit it during inflation. In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\dot{\phi}^2=\beta(\phi)V(\phi)$, where $\beta(\phi)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Scale-dependent Dark Matter Profile and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we use the recently introduced concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, and we provide an analytic model of dark matter that can produce viable rotation curves even for low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies, all known to challenge the cold dark matter description. The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $\rho(r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\frac{K_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.</description>

      <title>Arrow of time problem in gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the arrow of time problem in the context of gravitational collapse of radiating stars in higher dimensions for both neutral and charged matter. The interior spacetime is described by a shear-free spherically symmetric metric filled with a dissipative fluid. The exterior spacetime of the radiating star is taken as the higher dimensional Vaidya metric. We establish that the arrow of time associated with gravitational entropy is opposite to the thermodynamic arrow of time for all dimensions. The physical consequences of our results are considered. Our result conforms with previous studies on shear-free spherical collapse, which suggests, avoidance of the naked singularity as the end state results in a wrong arrow of time, indicating a fundamental problem with the local application of the Weyl curvature hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology as a Hydrogen atom: Discrete $\Lambda$ and cyclic Universes from Wheeler-DeWitt quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon our recently established correspondence between quantum cosmology and the hydrogen atom [1], we investigate the specific sector of a negative cosmological constant ($\Lambda &lt; 0$) in a flat FLRW universe with dust. While the positive $\Lambda$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $\Lambda$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case.</description>

      <title>GUP effects on Hawking temperature in a hot NUT Kerr Newman Kasuya Anti de Sitter black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use the generalised Klein-Gordon Equation in curved spacetime with an electromagnetic field to investigate the tunnelling phenomenon of scalar particles originating from the hot NUT Kerr Newman Kasuya Anti de Sitter (KNKNK AdS) black hole. Using the tunnelling formalism, we obtain a modified Hawking temperature different from previous works due to the quantum gravity effect for the charged Dirac particle at the HNKNK AdS black hole's horizon. We find that the modified Hawking temperature is affected by the cosmological constant, magnetic mass, electric and magnetic charges. We demonstrate that a significant number of discontinuities exist in the heat capacities of the HNKNK AdS, indicating that the black hole system becomes unstable as the black hole size decreases.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality in photon-graviton conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) is a temporal analogue of Bell's inequality and provides a quantitative test of the nonclassicality of a system through its violation. We analytically investigate the violation of the LGI in the context of photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field background, motivated by its potential applications to testing the nonclassicality of gravity. When gravitational perturbations are quantized as gravitons, the conversion of an initial single photon state gives rise to a superposition of photon and graviton states. We show that the temporal correlations obtained from successive projective measurements on the photon-graviton system violate the LGI. Observation of such a violation would provide a novel avenue for probing the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the procedure implemented in the Multi-Band Template Analysis (MBTA) search pipeline to produce online posterior distributions of compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave parameters. This procedure relies on an SNR optimizer technique, which consists of filtering dense local template banks. We present how these banks are constructed using information from the initial detection and detail how the results of the filtering are used to estimate source parameters and provide posterior distributions. We demonstrate the performance of our procedure on simulations and compare our source parameter estimates with the results from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) recently released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration.</description>

      <title>Pathology of the Unified Dark Sectors in Modified General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave detection via photon-graviton scattering and quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully quantum field-theoretic framework for gravitational wave (GW) detection in which the interaction is described as photon-graviton scattering. In this picture, the GW acts as a coherent background that induces inelastic energy exchanges with the electromagnetic field - analogous to the Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts in Raman spectroscopy. We propose a detection scheme sensitive to this microscopic mechanism based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the scattering-induced phase shifts render frequency-entangled photon pairs distinguishable, spoiling their destructive quantum interference. GW signal is thus encoded in the modulation of photon coincidence rates rather than classical field intensity, offering a complementary quantum probe of the gravitational universe that recovers the standard classical response in the macroscopic limit.</description>

      <title>Matter around Schwarzschild black holes in scalar-tensor theories: Absorption and Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption and scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole in scalar--tensor theories of gravity, where the coupling between matter and the scalar field induces different models for the effective mass of the scalar field. In model~I, a Bondi-type mass model described by the asymptotic mass $\mu_c$, horizon mass $\mu_H$, and profile slope $\lambda$, it is found that the absorption cross section increases with steeper $\lambda$, larger $\mu_c$ (especially at higher frequencies), or smaller $\mu_H$. The differential scattering cross section in this model shows the strongest dependence on the horizon mass $\mu_H$. When $\mu_H$ exceeds a critical value for a fixed incoming wave frequency $\omega$, no partial wave transmits into the black hole, flattening the differential scattering cross section as a function of angle before it increases again with further increase of $\mu_H$. Model~II, which considers a truncated accretion region outside some radius $r_0$, contains a potential well in its effective scattering potential. Its absorption cross section decreases in the low-frequency region as the accretion radius $r_0$ decreases, and more importantly, it shows resonance peaks at the quasibound wave frequencies due to resonances induced by the potential well. The differential scattering cross sections show dips around intermediate scattering angles when the parameters (mainly $\mu_H$ and $\omega$) are such that the resonantly scattered and non-resonant waves interfere destructively around these angles. In both models, absorption exhibits a zero-absorption band as $\omega$ approaches $\mu_c$ from above, and in both absorption and scattering, the effects of the parameters are found to diminish in the high-frequency limit.</description>

      <title>Beyond Comoving Volume: Horizon Flux and Matter Creation in Entropic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the derivation of the Friedmann equations from a thermodynamic perspective, applying the unified first law of thermodynamics to the apparent horizon of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. We extend this framework to incorporate gravitationally induced particle creation, treating the region enclosed by the apparent horizon as an open thermodynamic system. A crucial aspect of our analysis is the recognition that the apparent horizon volume is not comoving; this requires a consistent accounting of particle exchange across the moving boundary. We demonstrate that the evolution of the particle number, and explicitly the matter entropy, can be decomposed into two distinct physical contributions: genuine bulk particle production and a net flux induced by the dynamics of the horizon itself. Finally, we derive the Generalized Second Law (GSL) in this setting, showing transparently how the total entropy budget is balanced by horizon thermodynamics, bulk creation, and boundary fluxes.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Topological defects and scalar field modes in cosmological backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological defects with a general structure in higher-dimensional cosmological backgrounds described by a set of angle deficit parameters. As special cases, they include higher-dimensional generalizations of cosmic strings and global monopoles. The corresponding complete set of mode functions is presented for a massive scalar field with a general curvature coupling parameter. For general scale factors and radial functions in the line element, the angular parts of the scalar modes are expressed in terms of associated Legendre functions. De Sitter and Milne universes are considered as examples of cosmological expansion. For the de Sitter bulk, we present the time-dependent parts of the mode functions in inflationary, hyperbolic, and global coordinates.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Black Hole Magnetospheres with Inclined Ambient Fields</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields play a central role in black hole astrophysics, powering relativistic jets and other energetic phenomena. While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Tidal perturbations and Love Symmetry for five-dimensional charged rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal response of general five-dimensional (5D) black holes of STU supergravity, which include as special cases important solutions such as the Myers-Perry, BMPV, 5D Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr-Newman and dyonic black holes. Solutions are parameterized by their mass, two angular momenta and up to three $U(1)$ charges. Love numbers and dissipation coefficients are obtained in the static and dynamic cases. In the latter scenario, we find new, nontrivial conditions, realized in important limiting cases of the theory, such as the BPS limit, where frequency-independent vanishing conditions are obtained. We also develop a ladder formalism for static solutions and derive the conserved charges. To the best of our knowledge, this formalism had not been previously derived for 5D black holes, including neutral ones. Finally, we show the emergence of Love symmetry in the near-zone regime, and derive the generators of the associated $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. It is shown that all conditions for Love-number vanishing can be explained by this algebra in terms of the highest-weight property.</description>

      <title>Detector's response to coherent Rindler and Minkowski photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that the transition probability in a static two-level quantum detector interacting with a coherent Rindler photon is different from the same of the Rindler detector which is in interaction with a coherent Minkowski photon. Situation does not change in the response of quantum detector for the classical limit of the photon state. This we investigate in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$-spacetime dimensions. Interestingly, the transition probabilities of the ``classical'' detector in the classical limit of the photon state in $(1+1)$-dimensions, for these two scenarios, appear to be identical when the frequencies of photon mode and detector are taken to be same. However, our obtained detector's transition probabilities in $(3+1)$-dimensions, which are calculated under the large acceleration condition, do not show such signature. The implications of these observations are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Apparent Dark-Energy Evolution from Cosmic Inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation in expanding FRW universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the process of quantum teleportation in an expanding universe modeled by Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, focusing on two cosmologically relevant scenarios: a power-law expansion and the de Sitter universe. Adopting a field-theoretical approach, we analyze the quantum correlations between two comoving observers who share an entangled mode of a scalar field. Using the Bogoliubov transformation, we compute the teleportation fidelity and examine its dependence on the expansion rate, initial entanglement, and the mode frequency. Our findings indicate that spacetime curvature and the underlying cosmological background significantly affect the efficiency of quantum teleportation, particularly through mode mixing and vacuum structure. We also compare our results with the flat Minkowski case to highlight the role of cosmic expansion in degrading or preserving quantum information.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic supercriticality and complex phase diagram for the AdS black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the application of the Lee-Yang phase transition theorem to the realm of AdS black hole thermodynamics, thereby deriving a comprehensive complex phase diagram for such systems. Our research augments extant studies on black hole thermodynamic phase diagrams, particularly in the regime above the critical point, by delineating the Widom line of AdS black holes. This boundary segregates the supercritical domain of the phase diagram into two disparate zones. As the system traverses the thermodynamic crossover within the supercritical region, it undergoes a transition from one supercritical phase to another, while maintaining the continuity of its thermodynamic state functions. This behavior is fundamentally different from that below the critical point, where crossing the coexistence line results in discontinuities of thermodynamic state functions. The Widom line enables a thermodynamic crossover between single-phase states without traversing the spinodal that emerges in the critical region.</description>

      <title>Twisting inflation to sub-Planckian axion decay constants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pseudoscalar inflation in the Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (first-order) formulation of gravity while allowing for torsion. We introduce two non-minimal interactions in the gravitational sector: pseudoscalar couplings to the Pontryagin density (Chern-Simons term) and the Nieh-Yan topological invariant. In the presence of these terms, the rolling pseudoscalar sources non-trivial torsional fields during inflation. We show that pathological gradient and ghost instabilities limit the strength of the coupling to the Pontryagin density during inflation. Furthermore, we show that the interaction with the Nieh-Yan term induces a new contribution to the pseudoscalar kinetic term, which parametrically increases its decay constant and allows for inflation on steep potentials. The torsion field generated by the background is parity violating, which is manifest in the resulting chiral gravitational wave spectrum. We find that the scalar sector is largely unaffected beyond the remapping of the axion decay constant to a larger value. Consequently, we show that while natural inflation with a cosine potential remains inconsistent with observations, the squared quartic hilltop potential can be made consistent with Planck 2018 data even for sub-Planckian decay constants by coupling to the Nieh-Yan term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that a quantum system held in spatial superposition and then eventually recombined does experience decoherence from black hole horizons, at a level increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. In this, the effects of the horizon have been derived using a classical spacetime picture for the latter. In the present note we point out that quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the quantum black hole could significantly affect the results. In a specific effective implementation of the quantum geometry in terms of a minimal length and ensuing minimal area, it appears in particular that, for selected values of the quantum of area proposed on various grounds in the literature, the decoherence induced by the horizon turns out to be limited to negligibly small values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes, that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area $A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.</description>

Abstract: Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. Predictions for both phases can be significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by $f(R)$ theories with a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above $10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of horizonless compact objects within astrophysical environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</description>

      <title>Constraining a de Broglie--Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries for tidal Love numbers: Generalities and applications to analog black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers characterize the conservative, static response of compact objects to external tidal fields. Remarkably, these quantities vanish identically for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity. This behavior has been attributed to hidden symmetries -- both geometric and algebraic -- governing perturbations in these space-times. Interestingly, a similar vanishing of selected multipolar Love numbers arises in the context of supersonic acoustic flows. These systems share several key features with black holes in general relativity, such as the presence of an effective acoustic horizon and a wave equation describing linear excitations. In this work, we explore a symmetry-based connection between the two frameworks and demonstrate that the ladder symmetries observed in acoustic black holes can be traced to structural properties of the underlying wave equation, mirroring those found in general relativistic black hole space-times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenological implications of quantum gravity on rotating black holes within the framework of the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP), which incorporates both minimal length (ultraviolet) and large-scale (infrared) corrections. Lacking a full non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity, we adopt a metric-based approach. We construct a stationary, axisymmetric ansatz via the Newman-Janis algorithm to model the kinematic features of a rotating black hole subject to Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP) corrections. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that in the infrared-dominated regime, the Hawking temperature scales as $T_H \sim M^{-3}$, leading to a rapid cooling phase that significantly prolongs the lifetime of supermassive black holes. We derive the modified Teukolsky Master Equation for gravitational perturbations and demonstrate that the background geometry preserves the isospectrality between axial and polar modes. In the eikonal limit, the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum exhibits orthogonal shifts: the minimal length parameter $\beta$ induces a spectral blueshift and enhanced damping, while the large-scale parameter $\alpha$ induces a spectral redshift and suppressed damping. Finally, we constrain the theory using observational data from LIGO/Virgo and the Event Horizon Telescope. We establish that the shadow of M87* is approximately $10^6$ times more sensitive to large-scale corrections than Sgr A*, placing stringent bounds on the EUP parameter, while gravitational wave spectroscopy provides complementary constraints on the GUP sector.</description>

      <title>QPO-Based Bayesian Constraints on Charged Particle Dynamics Around Magnetized Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the motion of charged particles with a magnetic dipole moment orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external paraboloidal magnetic field. The interaction between the particle's intrinsic magnetic moment and the black hole magnetosphere is modeled through a dipole coupling, and the equations of motion are derived using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We analyze equatorial circular orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit, and epicyclic oscillations, showing that the magnetic field strength and coupling parameter produce competing effects on orbital stability and fundamental frequencies. These frequencies are applied to model high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis constrains the black hole mass, magnetic field strength, field geometry, coupling parameter, and QPO orbital radius, highlighting the role of magnetospheric interactions in shaping both particle dynamics and timing properties of accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Formation of trapped vacuum bubbles during inflation, and consequences for PBH scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of inflationary scenarios for primordial black hole (PBH) formation include a small barrier in the slope of the potential. There, the inflaton slows down, generating an enhancement of primordial perturbations. Moreover, the background solution overcomes the barrier at a very low speed, and large backward quantum fluctuations can prevent certain regions from overshooting the barrier. This leads to localized bubbles where the field remains trapped behind the barrier. In such models, therefore, we have two distinct channels for PBH production: the standard adiabatic density perturbation channel and the bubble channel. Here, we perform numerical simulations of bubble formation, addressing the issues of initial conditions, critical amplitude and bubble expansion. Further, we explore the scaling behaviour of the co-moving size of bubbles with the initial amplitude of the field fluctuation. We find that for small to moderate non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}\lesssim 2.6$, the threshold for the formation of vacuum bubbles agrees with previous analytical estimates arXiv:1908.11357 to $5\%$ accuracy or so. We also show that the mass distribution for the two channels is different, leading to a slightly broader range of PBH masses. The bubble channel is subdominant for small $f_{\rm NL}$, and becomes dominant for $f_{\rm NL}\gtrsim 2.6$. We find that the mass of PBHs in the bubble channel is determined by an adiabatic overdensity surrounding the bubble at the end of inflation. Remarkably, the profile of this overdensity turns out to be of type-II. This represents a first clear example showing that overdensities of type-II can be dominant relative to the standard type-I. We also comment on exponential tails and on the fact that in models with local type non-Gaussianity (such as the one considered here), the occurrence of alternative channels can easily be inferred from unitarity considerations.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Effective Field Theory Approach to Entanglement Harvesting, Quantum Discord and Bell's Nonlocality Bound Near a Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum information obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey and retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the surrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a quantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary quantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement harvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on the nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole as a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the mediator fields as observed in \cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual, biggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT) to derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we can easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering the complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional approach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative strengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole on the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW probe systems. Our PN-EFT approach can be extended to include the backreaction on the black holes in future studies by taking the higher-order PN corrections into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reduce the Taub-NUT metric dimensionally to three spatial dimensions by treating time as an extra curled dimension, and end up with the 3-dimensional Einstein field equations plus a corresponding Maxwell type equations for a gravitomagnetic field, associated with the NUT charge, which also acts as a source for the Einstein field equations. In this approach, the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (1 + 3)-dimensional analogue of the (1 + 4)-dimensional metric of the Kaluza- Klein theory. Hence, in four dimensions, it unifies gravitation and gravitomagnetism, associated with the NUT charge, in the same footing that the Kaluza-Klein theory unifies gravitation and electromagnetism in five dimensions. In fact, in this way, gravity and gravitomagnetism, associated with the NUT charge, appear as two distinct fields that emerge from the temporal dimensional reduction. We also introduce a relation between the 4-dimensional gravitational constant and the NUT charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MORRIS (Magnetic Oscillatory Resonator for Rare-Interaction Studies) and propose the first tabletop search for non-Newtonian gravity due to a Yukawa-like fifth force using a magnetically levitated particle. Our experiment comprises a levitated sub-millimeter magnet in a superconducting trap that is driven by a time-periodic source. Featuring short-, medium-, and long-term stages, MORRIS will admit increasing sensitivities to the force coupling strength $\alpha$, optimally probing screening lengths of $\lambda \sim 1\,\mathrm{mm}$. Our short-term setup provides a proof-of-principle study, with our medium- and long-term stages respectively constraining $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-5}$, leading over existing bounds. Our projections are readily recastable to concrete models predicting the existence of fifth forces, and our statistical analysis is generally applicable to well-characterized sinusoidal driving forces. By leveraging ultralow dissipation and heavy test masses, MORRIS opens a new window onto tests of small-scale gravity and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We present a two-tone heterodyne optical readout scheme to extract unequal-time density correlations along an arbitrary stationary interaction path from a pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, using a modulated laser probe. Analysing the measurement noise both from imprecision and backaction, we identify the standard quantum limit for the signal-extraction scheme, and examine how a class of two-mode squeezed initial states can be used to push beyond this limit. As an application, we show how the readout scheme can be used for an experimentally feasible realisation of acceleration-dependence of quantum-vacuum fluctuations in the system, including the analogue spacetime circular motion Unruh effect. The scheme is adaptable beyond Bose-Einstein condensates, providing nondestructive access to unequal-time correlations in quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic studies of accretion disk and magnetic field geometry in M87*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.</description>

      <title>Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description>

Abstract: We present a local-to-global cosmological framework in which cosmic acceleration emerges from structure formation in an inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter (iEdS) universe, without dark energy. The model exhibits a quasilinear coasting evolution toward an effective Milne state driven by growing inhomogeneities. We test the iEdS model with ${H_0=72.5\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}}$ and ${\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}=0.272}$ using CMB, BAO, and SN Ia data. The iEdS model fits the data comparably to $\Lambda$CDM and resolves the $H_0$ tension, while yielding a cosmic age ${t_0\simeq 13.67\ \mathrm{Gyr}}$ consistent with globular-cluster estimates.</description>

      <title>Full spectrum of Love numbers of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in D-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau with a sharp transition to slow roll. We focus on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement of Anyonic Charges and Emergent Spacetime Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be canceled by contributions from the radiative memory region, while its dimensional-regularisation pole should cancel against the radiative tail region. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave detectors from an experimental perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of gravitational wave detectors in a simple and comprehensive manner. Because these instruments aim for extremely high sensitivity, it is essential to understand their various noise sources, how such noise couples to the detector output, and the strategies used to mitigate them. These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated. Although a simplified layout of a gravitational wave detector is considered, it takes into account the most dominant effects and yields in a sensitivity estimate close to the what is observed in real detectors.</description>
