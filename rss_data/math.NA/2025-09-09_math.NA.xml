      <title>A class of regularization schemes for linear ill-posed problems in Banach spaces under low order source conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider, in a Banach space framework, the regularization of linear ill-posed problems. Our focus is on the recovery of solutions that have a logarithmic source representation. Such cases typically occur in exponentially ill-posed problems like the backwards heat equation. The mathematical framework on logarithms of operators is provided, and convergence rates for a class of parametric regularization schemes are deduced. This class includes the iterated version of Lavrentiev's method and the method of the abstract Cauchy problem. The presentation includes both a priori and a posteriori parameter choice strategies. Finally, we present an example for a logarithmic source representable function with respect to the integration operator.</description>

      <title>Fast Multipole Method with Complex Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a variant of the fast multipole method (FMM) for efficiently evaluating standard layer potentials on geometries with complex coordinates in two and three dimensions. The complex scaled boundary integral method for the efficient solution of scattering problems on unbounded domains results in complex point locations upon discretization. Classical real-coordinate FMMs are no longer applicable, hindering the use of this approach for large-scale problems. Here we develop the complex-coordinate FMM based on the analytic continuation of certain special function identities used in the construction of the classical FMM. To achieve the same linear time complexity as the classical FMM, we construct a hierarchical tree based solely on the real parts of the complex point locations, and derive convergence rates for truncated expansions when the imaginary parts of the locations are a Lipschitz function of the corresponding real parts. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through several numerical examples and illustrate its application for solving large-scale time-harmonic water wave problems and Helmholtz transmission problems.</description>

      <title>Workflow for High-Fidelity Dynamic Analysis of Structures with Pile Foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity numerical simulations in soil-structure interaction analysis is on the rise, yet a standardized workflow to guide the creation of such simulations remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting a step-by-step guideline proposing a workflow for dynamic analysis of structures with pile foundations. The proposed workflow encompasses instructions on how to use Domain Reduction Method for loading, Perfectly Matched Layer elements for wave absorption, soil-structure interaction modeling using Embedded interface elements, and domain decomposition for efficient use of processing units. Through a series of numerical simulations, we showcase the practical application of this workflow. Our results reveal the efficacy of the Domain Reduction Method in reducing simulation size without compromising model fidelity, show the precision of Perfectly Matched Layer elements in modeling infinite domains, highlight the efficiency of Embedded Interface elements in establishing connections between structures and the soil domain, and demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the proposed workflow in conducting high-fidelity simulations. While our study focuses on simplified geometries and loading scenarios, it serves as a foundational framework for future research endeavors aimed at exploring more intricate structural configurations and dynamic loading conditions</description>

      <title>High-order staggered Lagrangian hydrodynamics (I): framework of the discretization scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05944v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a discretization framework for high-order staggered Lagrangian hydrodynamics, bridging two well-established algorithms algorithms: high-order curvilinear finite element Lagrangian hydrodynamics [Dobrev et al. 2012] and compatible hydrodynamics methods[Caramana et al.1998]. We emphasizes the critical relationship between the degrees of freedom (DOFs) associated with the density variable and the choice of numerical quadrature rules which is employed in the mass conservation law. The precise quadrature rule will lead the consistency issues arising from the density and internal energy variables being defined at different physical points. Our approach resolves this by unifying the quadrature rule for the specific discretization space, though this inevitably introduces hourglass distortion. Another key feature of the proposed framework is the strategic arrangement of DOFs for kinematic and thermodynamic variables, which enhances computational efficiency and leads to diagonal mass matrices in the momentum and energy equations. Finally, we present a smooth numerical example that validate the accuracy of the proposed high-order Lagrangian hydrodynamics framework.</description>

      <title>Transformation from Bi-CG into Bi-CR using a residual smoothing-like scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual smoothing techniques, which produce a smooth convergence behavior of linear iterative solvers, also form connections between different methods. For example, minimal residual smoothing can transform the residuals of the conjugate gradient (CG) method into those of the conjugate residual (CR) method for linear systems with symmetric matrices. In this study, we investigate whether a similar relationship can be constructed between the Bi-CG and Bi-CR methods for nonsymmetric linear systems. Numerical experiments regarding the aforementioned connection demonstrate the validity of our insights.</description>

      <title>Recursive vectorized computation of the Frobenius norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursive algorithms for computing the Frobenius norm of a real array are proposed, based on hypot, a hypotenuse function. Comparing their relative accuracy bounds with those of the BLAS routine DNRM2 it is shown that the proposed algorithms could in many cases be significantly more accurate. The scalar recursive algorithms are vectorized with the Intel's vector instructions to achieve performance comparable to xNRM2, and are further parallelized with OpenCilk. Some scalar algorithms are unconditionally bitwise reproducible, while the reproducibility of the vector ones depends on the vector width.</description>

      <title>A High-order Backpropagation Algorithm for Neural Stochastic Differential Equation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural stochastic differential equation model with a Brownian motion term can capture epistemic uncertainty of deep neural network from the perspective of a dynamical system. The goal of this paper is to improve the convergence rate of the sample-wise backpropagation algorithm in neural stochastic differential equation model which has been proposed in [Archibald et al., SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 62 (2024), pp. 593-621]. It is necessary to emphasize that, improving the convergence order of the algorithm consisting of forward backward stochastic differential equations remains challenging, due to the loss of information of Z term in backward equations under sample-wise approximation and the limitations of the forward network form. In this paper, we develop a high-order backpropagation algorithm to improve the training accuracy. Under the convexity assumption, the result indicates that the first-order convergence is achieved when the number of training steps is proportional to the cubic number of layers. Finally, numerical examples illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Multigrid-Accelerated Compact Gas-Kinetic Scheme for Fast Convergence in High-Speed Flows on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit methods and GPU parallelization are two distinct yet powerful strategies for accelerating high-order CFD algorithms. However, few studies have successfully integrated both approaches within high-speed flow solvers. The core challenge lies in preserving the robustness of implicit algorithms in the presence of strong discontinuities, while simultaneously enabling massive thread parallelism under the constraints of limited GPU memory. To address this, we propose a GPU-optimized, geometric multigrid-accelerated, high-order compact gas kinetic scheme (CGKS) that incorporates three key innovations:
  (1) a multi-color lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel scheme that eliminates thread conflicts and preserves memory efficiency, serving as an implicit smoother on coarse grids; (2) a discontinuity-adaptive relaxation technique and a multigrid prolongation process, based on a discontinuous feedback factor, which dynamically stabilize shock regions without compromising convergence in smooth zones; and (3) a three-layer V-cycle geometric parallel multigrid strategy specifically tailored for unstructured meshes. Extensive tests on multi-dimensional subsonic to hypersonic flows demonstrate that our GPU-based high-performance solver achieves one to two orders of magnitude faster convergence compared to previous explicit solvers. More importantly, it preserves the shock-capturing robustness of the explicit CGKS and exhibits strong scalability on GPU architectures. This work presents a unified framework that synergistically leverages implicit acceleration and GPU optimization for high-speed flow simulations, effectively overcoming traditional trade-offs between parallelism, memory constraints, and numerical stability in high-order methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to generalize the work of B. Buet and M. Rumpf on some definition of the approximate mean curvature vector for varifolds, and its associated mean curvature motions for points clouds. We propose a generalization of the definition of the approximate mean curvature vector in two terms: in terms of linear operators and in terms of regularity of the varifold. We then extend the results to the approximate second fundamental form. Finally, we prove some additional comparison principles satisfied by the motion of points cloud by mean curvature (in the discrete and the continuous cases).</description>

      <title>Sequential symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method for fully coupled quasi-static thermo-poroelasticity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a sequentially decoupled numerical method for solving the fully coupled quasi-static thermo-poroelasticity problems with nonlinear convective transport. The symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method is employed for spatial discretization and the backward Euler method for temporal discretization. Unlike other splitting algorithms, this type of sequential method does not require any internal iterations and the computational efficiency is higher than that of the fully implicit nonlinear numerical scheme. In the theoretical analysis, a cut-off operator is introduced to prove the existence and uniqueness of numerical solution and the stability analysis of numerical scheme is conducted. Then, we derive the optimal convergence order estimates in space and time. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Solving PDEs on Surfaces of Pipe Geometries Using New Coordinate Transformations and High-order Compact Finite Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce suitable coordinate systems for pipes and their variants that allow us to transform partial differential equations (PDEs) on the pipe surfaces or in the solid pipes into computational domains with fixed limits/ranges. Such a notion is reminiscent of the polar and cylindrical coordinates for their advantageous geometries. The new curvilinear coordinates are non-orthogonal in two directions, so the Laplace--Beltrami operators involve mixed derivatives. To deal with the variable coefficients arising from coordinate transformations and diverse surface geometries, we develop efficient fourth-order compact finite difference methods adaptable to various scenarios. We then rigorously prove the convergence of the proposed method for some model problem, and apply the solver to several other types of PDEs. We further demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach with ample numerical results. Here, we only consider the compact finite differences for the transformed PDEs for simplicity, but one can employ the spectral-collocation methods to efficiently handle such variable coefficient problems.</description>

      <title>Fractal Based Rational Cubic Trigonometric Zipper Interpolation with Positivity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel fractal based interpolation scheme termed Rational Cubic Trigonometric Zipper Fractal Interpolation Functions (RCTZFIFs) designed to model and preserve the inherent geometric property, positivity, in given datasets. The method employs a combination of rational cubic trigonometric functions within a zipper fractal framework, offering enhanced flexibility through shape parameters and scaling factors. Rigorous error analysis is presented to establish the convergence of the proposed zipper fractal interpolants to the underlying classical fractal functions, and subsequently, to the data-generating function. We derive necessary constraints on the scaling factors and shape parameters to ensure positivity preservation. By carefully selecting the signature, shape parameters, and scaling factors within these bounds, we construct a class of RCTZFIFs that effectively preserve the positive nature of the data, as compared to a reference interpolant that may violate this property. Numerical experiments and visualisations demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach in preserving positivity while offering fractal flexibility.</description>

      <title>A novel time integration scheme for linear parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a class of Crank-Nicolson (CN) type schemes enhanced by radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for the time integration of linear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The resulting RBF-CN schemes preserve the structural simplicity of the classical CN method while enabling higher-order temporal accuracy through the optimization of the shape parameter. Consistency analysis shows that the schemes are always at least second-order accurate and a simple choice of the shape parameter increases the accuracy by two orders over the standard CN scheme. Further optimization can reduce the next leading error term to attain even higher-order accuracy. A von Neumann stability analysis confirms that the stability conditions are essentially the same as those of the standard CN scheme. Several numerical experiments in 1D are carried out to verify the theoretical results under different boundary conditions. Particular focus is given to the startup stage, where several strategies for computing the initial steps are examined, and Gauss-Legendre implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods are found to be the most effective. The experiments further demonstrate that, with optimal initialization, the proposed schemes deliver accuracy comparable to implicit Runge-Kutta methods while achieving nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Fisher entropic Fokker-Planck model of monatomic rarefied gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-based stochastic approximations of the Boltzmann equation are popular tools for simulations of non-equilibrium gas flows, for which the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations fail to provide accurate description. However, these numerical methods are computationally demanding, especially in the near-continuum regime, where the collisions become overwhelming. On the other hand, the Fokker-Planck kinetic models offer an efficient alternative, as the binary collisions are described by a diffusive process. Despite the intuitive advantage, rigorous and efficient Fokker-Planck approximations of the Boltzmann equation remain an open problem. On one hand, the moment projection of the Fokker-Planck operator should be consistent with that of the Boltzmann operator. On the other hand, the Fokker-Planck model should be constructed in such a way that the H-theorem is satisfied. The central aim of this study is fulfilling these two categorically different constraints, i.e. moment matching and entropy dissipation, within a flexible and tractable Fokker-Planck framework. To this end, we introduce a Fisher information-based entropic constraint and demonstrate that, with a suitable polynomial expansion of the drift term, it is possible to simultaneously achieve weak moment matching while honouring the H-theorem. We support our theoretical result by numerical experiments on the shock problem, validating our Fisher Entropic Fokker-Planck framework.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Solver with Multiphysics Finite Element Method for Poroelasticity Coupled with Elasticity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a parallel solver for solving the quasi-static linear poroelasticity coupled with linear elasticity model in the Lagrange multiplier framework. Firstly, we reformulate the model into a coupling of the nearly incompressible elasticity and an unsteady affection-diffusion equations by setting new variable ``elastic pressure" and ``volumetric fluid content". And we introduce a Lagrange multiplier to guarantee the normal stress continuity on the interface. Then, we give the variational formulations in each subdomain and choose the $\boldsymbol{P}_k$-$P_1$-$P_1$ mixed finite element tuple for poroelasticity subdomain, and $\boldsymbol{P}_k$-$P_1$ finite element pair ($k=1,2$) for elasticity subdomain and the backward Euler scheme for time. Also, we propose a parallel solver for solving the fully discrete scheme at each time step -- the FETI method with a classical FETI preconditioner for solving the Lagrange multiplier and calculating the subproblems in each subdomain in parallel. And we show several numerical tests to validate the computational efficiency and the convergence error order, and we consider Barry-Mercer's model as the benchmark test to show that there no oscillation in the computed pressure. Finally, we draw conclusions to summarize the main results of this paper.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we assess the performance of adaptive and nested factorized sparse approximate inverses as smoothers in multilevel V-cycles, when smoothing is performed following the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind. For our test problems, we rely on the partition of unity method to discretize the biharmonic and triharmonic equations in a multilevel manner. Inspired by existing algorithms, we introduce a new adaptive algorithm for the construction of sparse approximate inverses, based on the block structure of matrices arising in the partition of unity method. Additionally, we also present a new (and arguably simpler) formulation of the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind.</description>

      <title>Cryo-EM as a Stochastic Inverse Problem</title>

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) enables high-resolution imaging of biomolecules, but structural heterogeneity remains a major challenge in 3D reconstruction. Traditional methods assume a discrete set of conformations, limiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability. In this work, we formulate cryo-EM reconstruction as a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) over probability measures, where the observed images are modeled as the push-forward of an unknown distribution over molecular structures via a random forward operator. We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a variational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions, using statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The resulting optimization is performed over the space of probability measures via a Wasserstein gradient flow, which we numerically solve using particles to represent and evolve conformational ensembles. We validate our approach using synthetic examples, including a realistic protein model, which demonstrates its ability to recover continuous distributions over structural states. We analyze the connection between our formulation and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approaches, which can be interpreted as instances of the discretize-then-optimize (DTO) framework. We further provide a consistency analysis, establishing conditions under which DTO methods, such as MAP estimation, converge to the solution of the underlying infinite-dimensional continuous problem. Beyond cryo-EM, the framework provides a general methodology for solving SIPs involving random forward operators.</description>

      <title>Energy Transfer Dynamics Generated by Non-Axisymmetric Tornado-Type Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy cascade in turbulence, first statistically described by Richardson (1922) and Kolmogorov (1941), lacked connection to the underlying fluid dynamics. Recent numerical studies of Goto et al. (2017) and Yoneda et al. (2022) revealed scale-local energy transfer via vortex stretching but remained within spatial statistics. This study aims to uncover the time-dependent elementary process behind the energy cascade by constructing a tornado-type flow in a non-axisymmetric curved cylindrical domain. Our approach reveals specific vortex dynamics responsible for energy transfer, offering new insight into the physical mechanisms of turbulence.</description>

      <title>High-order Magnus Expansion for Hamiltonian Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of quantum dynamics with time-dependent Hamiltonians is important not only for time-varying systems but also for time-independent Hamiltonians in the interaction picture. Such simulations are more challenging than their time-independent counterparts due to the complexity introduced by time ordering. Existing algorithms that aim to capture commutator-based scaling either exhibit polynomial cost dependence on the Hamiltonian's time derivatives or are limited to low-order accuracy. In this work, we establish the general commutator-scaling error bounds for the truncated Magnus expansion at arbitrary order, where only Hamiltonian terms appear in the nested commutators, with no time derivatives involved. Building on this analysis, we design a high-order quantum algorithm with explicit circuit constructions. The algorithm achieves cost scaling with the commutator structure in the high-precision regime and depends only logarithmically on the Hamiltonian's time variation, making it efficient for general time-dependent settings, including the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>The role of the initial distribution in population survival within a bounded habitat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the role of initial conditions in population persistence. Specifically, we consider the reaction-diffusion equation $u_t\,=\,D\,(u^{\nu-1}\,u_x)_x\,+\,a\,u^{\mu}$, with $\mu,\nu&gt;0$, accompanied by hostile boundary conditions and examine two families of one-parametric initial distributions, including homogeneous distributions. The model was previously studied by Colombo and Anteneodo (2018). They determined appropriate habitat sizes $l$ for the survival of a population, whose individuals are initially placed homogeneously within the full habitat domain with a total initial population $n_0$. We show that the survival condition can be naturally formulated in terms of the parameter $Q:=\frac{a}{D}l^{-\mu+\nu+2}n_0^{\mu-\nu}$. Indeed, there exists a critical value $Q_c$ determined by $\mu$, $\nu$ and the initial distribution parameter such that the survival condition can always be written as $Q\geq Q_c$. Notably, from this point of view, one can derive a condition for $Q$ that holds universally for our model under conditional persistence ($\mu\geq\nu$). It applies, in particular, to the case $\mu=\nu+2$, which was not addressed in the previously mentioned work. Nevertheless, in this case $Q=\frac{a}{D}n_0^2$, therefore survival depends solely on the total population, not on the habitat size. We apply a finite-difference scheme to estimate $Q_c$. Conversely, given a population whose evolution is determined by $\mu$, $\nu$, $l$, $n_0$, and the growth and diffusion coefficients $a$ and $D$ (and consequently the value of $Q$) we use the numerical algorithm to estimate the initial distribution to ensure population survival.</description>

      <title>Quadrature rules with few nodes supported on algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quadrature rules for measures supported on real algebraic and rational curves, focusing on the {odd-degree} case \(2s-1\). Adopting an optimization viewpoint, we minimize suitable penalty functions over the space of quadrature rules of strength \(2s-1\), so that optimal solutions yield rules with the minimal number of nodes. For plane algebraic curves of degree \(d\), we derive explicit node bounds depending on \(d\) and the number of places at infinity, improving results of Riener--Schweighofer, and Zalar. For rational curves in arbitrary dimension of degree \(d\), we further refine these bounds using the geometry of the parametrization and recover the classical Gaussian quadrature bound when \(d=1\). Our results reveal a direct link between the algebraic complexity of the supporting curve and the minimal size of quadrature formulas, providing a unified framework that connects real algebraic geometry, polynomial optimization, and moment theory.</description>

      <title>Sequential Least-Squares Estimators with Fast Randomized Sketching for Linear Statistical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel randomized framework for the estimation problem of large-scale linear statistical models, namely Sequential Least-Squares Estimators with Fast Randomized Sketching (SLSE-FRS), which integrates Sketch-and-Solve and Iterative-Sketching methods for the first time. By iteratively constructing and solving sketched least-squares (LS) subproblems with increasing sketch sizes to achieve better precisions, SLSE-FRS gradually refines the estimators of the true parameter vector, ultimately producing high-precision estimators. We analyze the convergence properties of SLSE-FRS, and provide its efficient implementation. Numerical experiments show that SLSE-FRS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method, and the Iterative Double Sketching (IDS) method.</description>

Abstract: This work is devoted to the Galerkin projection of highly nonlinear random quantities. The dependency on a random input is described by Haar-type wavelet systems. The classical Haar sequence has been used by Pettersson, Iaccarino, Nordstroem (2014) for a hyperbolic stochastic Galerkin formulation of the one-dimensional Euler equations. This work generalizes their approach to several multi-dimensional systems with Lipschitz continuous and non-polynomial flux functions. Theoretical results are illustrated numerically by a genuinely multidimensional CWENO reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied linear weighted sampling algorithms and their optimality for approximate recovery of functions with mixed smoothness on $\mathbb{R}^d$ from a set of $n$ their sampled values. Functions to be recovered are in weighted Sobolev spaces $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of mixed smoothness, and the approximation error is measured by the norm of the weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Here, the weight $w$ is a tensor-product Freud-type weight. The optimality of linear sampling algorithms is investigated in terms of sampling $n$-widths. We constructed linear sampling algorithms on sparse grids of sampled points which form a step hyperbolic cross in the function domain, and which give upper bounds for the corresponding sampling $n$-widths. We proved that in the one-dimensional case, these algorithms realize the right convergence rate of the $n$-sampling widths.</description>

      <title>High-order Adaptive Rank Integrators for Multi-scale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations in the Hierarchical Tucker Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new adaptive rank approximation technique for computing solutions to the high-dimensional linear kinetic transport equation. The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.</description>

      <title>Estimation of spectral gaps for sparse symmetric matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and analyze an algorithm for identifying spectral gaps of a real symmetric matrix $A$ by simultaneously approximating the traces of spectral projectors associated with multiple different spectral slices. Our method utilizes Hutchinson's stochastic trace estimator together with the Lanczos algorithm to approximate quadratic forms involving spectral projectors. Instead of focusing on determining the gap between two particular consecutive eigenvalues of $A$, we aim to find all gaps that are wider than a specified threshold. By examining the problem from this perspective, and thoroughly analyzing both the Hutchinson and the Lanczos components of the algorithm, we obtain error bounds that allow us to determine the numbers of Hutchinson's sample vectors and Lanczos iterations needed to ensure the detection of all gaps above the target width with high probability. In particular, we conclude that the most efficient strategy is to always use a single random sample vector for Hutchinson's estimator and concentrate all computational effort in the Lanczos algorithm. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of this approach.</description>

      <title>Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, stochastic algorithms have emerged as scalable and efficient tools for solving large-scale ill-posed inverse problems by randomly selecting subsets of equations at each iteration. However, due to the ill-posedness and measurement noise, these methods often suffer from oscillations and semi-convergence behavior, posing challenges in achieving stable and accurate reconstructions. This study proposes a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach, the iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) to address nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method tends to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori information of the noise level. We show that the method terminatesinfinitelymanystepsincaseofnoisydataandhasregularizingfeatures. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical efficacy of the method.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with constructing an invariant-domain preserving approximation technique for the compressible Euler equations with general equations of state that preserves the minimum principle on the physical entropy. We derive a sufficient wave speed estimate for the Riemann problem under some mild thermodynamic assumptions on the equation of state. This minimum principle is guaranteed through the use of discrete auxiliary states which are in the invariant domain when using this new wave speed estimate. Finally, we numerically illustrate the proposed methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the reconstruction of a potential coefficient in an elliptic partial differential equation from distributed observations within the Bayesian framework. The choice of prior distribution is crucial in such inverse problems, particularly when the target function exhibits sharp discontinuities that conventional Gaussian priors fail to capture effectively. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel prior based on persistent homology (PH), which quantifies and encodes the topological features of candidate functions through their persistent pairs. To ensure a well-defined distribution in infinite-dimensional spaces, the prior is constructed with respect to a Gaussian reference measure. A significant advantage over classical approaches is that the PH prior only requires the unknown functions to belong to a suitable topological space, which substantially enhances its applicability. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed PH prior outperforms the Gaussian prior and achieves a modest yet consistent improvement over the classical total variation (TV) prior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a randomized algorithm for producing a quasi-optimal hierarchically semi-separable (HSS) approximation to an $N\times N$ matrix $A$ using only matrix-vector products with $A$ and $A^T$. We prove that, using $O(k \log(N/k))$ matrix-vector products and ${O}(N k^2 \log(N/k))$ additional runtime, the algorithm returns an HSS matrix $B$ with rank-$k$ blocks whose expected Frobenius norm error $\mathbb{E}[\|A - B\|_F^2]$ is at most $O(\log(N/k))$ times worse than the best possible approximation error by an HSS rank-$k$ matrix. In fact, the algorithm we analyze in a simple modification of an empirically effective method proposed by [Levitt &amp; Martinsson, SISC 2024]. As a stepping stone towards our main result, we prove two results that are of independent interest: a similar guarantee for a variant of the algorithm which accesses $A$'s entries directly, and explicit error bounds for near-optimal subspace approximation using projection-cost-preserving sketches. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis constitutes the first polynomial-time quasi-optimality result for HSS matrix approximation, both in the explicit access model and the matrix-vector product query model.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive-rank Approach with Greedy Sampling for Multi-scale BGK Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive-rank method for simulating multi-scale BGK equations, based on a greedy sampling strategy. The method adaptively selects important rows and columns of the solution matrix and updates them using a local semi-Lagrangian solver. An adaptive cross approximation then reconstructs the full solution matrix. This extends our prior semi-Lagrangian adaptive-rank framework, developed for the Vlasov-Poisson system, to nonlinear collisional kinetic equations. Unlike step-and-truncate low-rank integrators, our greedy sampling approach avoids explicit low-rank decompositions of nonlinear terms, such as the local Maxwellian in the BGK operator. To ensure conservation, we introduce a locally macroscopic conservative correction that implicitly couples the kinetic and macroscopic systems, enforcing mass, momentum, and energy conservation. Through asymptotic analysis, we show that this correction preserves the full-grid scheme's asymptotic behavior, and that the proposed method is conditionally asymptotic-preserving in the low-rank setting. A key advantage of our approach is its use of a local semi-Lagrangian solver, which allows large time steps. This flexibility is retained in the macroscopic solver using high-order stiffly accurate diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. The resulting nonlinear systems are solved efficiently using a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, avoiding the need for preconditioning at modest CFL numbers. Each nonlinear iteration provides a self-consistent correction to a provisional kinetic solution, which serves as a dynamic closure for the macroscopic model. Numerical results demonstrate the method's accuracy in capturing shocks and its robustness across mixed-regime problems with wide-ranging Knudsen numbers.</description>

      <title>Error estimates and adaptivity for a least-squares method applied to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce novel a posteriori error indicators for a nonlinear least-squares solver for smooth solutions of the Monge--Amp\`ere equation on convex polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. At each iteration, our iterative scheme decouples the problem into (i) a pointwise nonlinear minimization problem and (ii) a linear biharmonic variational problem. For the latter, we derive an equivalence to a biharmonic problem with Navier boundary conditions and solve it via mixed piecewise-linear finite elements. Reformulating this as a coupled second-order system, we derive a priori and a posteriori $\mathbb{P}^1$ finite element error estimators and we design a robust adaptive mesh refinement strategy. Numerical tests confirm that errors in different norms scale appropriately. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our a posteriori indicators in guiding mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>A quasi-Trefftz space for a second order time-harmonic Maxwell's equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-Trefftz methods are a family of Discontinuous Galerkin methods relying on equation-dependent function spaces. This work is the first study of the notion of local Taylor-based polynomial quasi-Trefftz space for a system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These discrete spaces are introduced here for electro-magnetic wave propagation in inhomogeneous media, governed by a second order formulation of Maxwell's equation with variable coefficients. Thanks to an adequate Helmholtz decomposition for spaces of homogeneous polynomial vector fields, the outcome is the explicit dimension of the proposed quasi-Trefftz space as well as a procedure to construct quasi-Trefftz functions.</description>

      <title>Differentiable DG with Neural Operator Source Term Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational advances have fundamentally transformed the landscape of numerical simulations, enabling unprecedented levels of complexity and precision in modeling physical phenomena. While these high-fidelity simulations offer invaluable insights for scientific discovery and problem solving, they impose substantial computational requirements. Consequently, low-fidelity models augmented with subgrid-scale parameterizations are employed to achieve computational feasibility. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable framework for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This integrated approach combines a differentiable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver with a neural network source term. Through the implementation of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) for network parameter optimization, our methodology ensures continuous interaction with the governing equations throughout the training process. We refer to this approach as NODE-DG. This hybrid approach combines the accuracy of numerical methods with the efficiency of machine learning, offering the following key advantages: (1) improved accuracy of low-order DG approximations by capturing subgrid-scale dynamics; (2) robustness against nonuniform or missing temporal data; (3) elimination of operator-splitting errors; (3) total mass conservation; and (4) a continuous-in-time operator that enables variable time step predictions, which accelerate projected high-order DG simulations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework through two examples: two-dimensional Kelvin--Helmholtz instability and three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex examples.</description>

      <title>A simple and efficient hybrid discretization approach to alleviate membrane locking in isogeometric thin shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new hybrid discretization approach to alleviate membrane locking in isogeometric finite element formulations for Kirchhoff-Love shells. The approach is simple, and requires no additional dofs and no static condensation. It does not increase the bandwidth of the tangent matrix and is effective for both linear and nonlinear problems. It combines isogeometric surface discretizations with classical Lagrange-based surface discretizations, and can thus be run with existing isogeometric finite element codes. Also, the stresses can be recovered straightforwardly. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in alleviating, if not eliminating, membrane locking is demonstrated through the rigorous study of the convergence behavior of several classical benchmark problems. Accuracy gains are particularly large in the membrane stresses. The approach is formulated here for quadratic NURBS, but an extension to other discretization types can be anticipated. The same applies to other constraints and associated locking phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision numerics in scientific applications: survey and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads has led to a significant increase in silicon area dedicated to lower-precision computations on recent high-performance computing hardware designs. However, mixed-precision capabilities, which can achieve performance improvements of 8x compared to double-precision in extreme compute-intensive workloads, remain largely untapped in most scientific applications. A growing number of efforts have shown that mixed-precision algorithmic innovations can deliver superior performance without sacrificing accuracy. These developments should prompt computational scientists to seriously consider whether their scientific modeling and simulation applications could benefit from the acceleration offered by new hardware and mixed-precision algorithms. In this survey, we (1) review progress across diverse scientific domains -- including fluid dynamics, weather and climate, quantum chemistry, and computational genomics -- that have begun adopting mixed-precision strategies; (2) examine state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques such as iterative refinement, splitting and emulation schemes, and adaptive precision solvers; (3) assess their implications for accuracy, performance, and resource utilization; and (4) survey the emerging software ecosystem that enables mixed-precision methods at scale. We conclude with perspectives and recommendations on cross-cutting opportunities, domain-specific challenges, and the role of co-design between application scientists, numerical analysts and computer scientists. Collectively, this survey underscores that mixed-precision numerics can reshape computational science by aligning algorithms with the evolving landscape of hardware capabilities.</description>

      <title>dyGRASS: Dynamic Spectral Graph Sparsification via Localized Random Walks on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents dyGRASS, an efficient dynamic algorithm for spectral sparsification of large undirected graphs that undergo streaming edge insertions and deletions. At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based method to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original graph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For incremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical edges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For decremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from the original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational efficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme that allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target updates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and scalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while eliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification tasks. Moreover, dyGRASS delivers high efficiency and superior solution quality for fully dynamic graph sparsification, accommodating both edge insertions and deletions across a diverse range of graph instances originating from integrated circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks.</description>

      <title>A Fourier finite volume approach for the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.</description>

      <title>Conservative data-driven finite element framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new data-driven finite element framework that is applicable to a broad range of engineering simulation problems. In the data-driven approach, the conservation laws and boundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, while the experimental data is used directly in numerical simulations, avoiding material models. Critically, we introduce a "weaker'" mixed finite element formulation, which relaxes the regularity requirements on the approximation space for the primary field. At the same time, the continuity of the normal flux component is enforced across inner boundaries, allowing the conservation law to be satisfied in the strong sense. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it easier to observe how imperfections in the datasets, such as missing or noisy data, result in non-uniqueness of the solution. This can be quantified to predict the uncertainty of the results using methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. Furthermore, this formulation provides a posteriori error indicators tailored for the data-driven approach, providing confidence in the results and enabling efficient solution schemes via adaptive hp-refinement. The capabilities of the formulation are demonstrated on an example of the nonlinear heat transfer in nuclear graphite using synthetically generated material datasets. This work provides an essential component for numerical frameworks for complex engineering systems such as digital twins.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic operator learning: generative modeling and uncertainty quantification for foundation models of differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context operator networks (ICON) are a class of operator learning methods based on the novel architectures of foundation models. Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</description>
