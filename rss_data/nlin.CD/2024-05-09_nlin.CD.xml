      <title>Intermediate spectral statistics of rational triangular quantum billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangular billiards whose angles are rational multiples of $\pi$ are one of the simplest examples of pseudo-integrable models with intriguing classical and quantum properties. We perform an extensive numerical study of spectral statistics of eight quantized rational triangles, six belonging to the family of right-angled Veech triangles and two obtuse rational triangles. Large spectral samples of up to one million energy levels were calculated for each triangle which permits to determine their spectral statistics with great accuracy. It is demonstrated that they are of the intermediate type, sharing some features with chaotic systems, like level repulsion and some with integrable systems, like exponential tails of the level spacing distributions. Another distinctive feature of intermediate spectral statistics is a finite value of the level compressibility.
  The short range statistics such as the level spacing distributions, and long-range statistics such as the number variance and spectral form factors were analyzed in detail. An excellent agreement between the numerical data and the model of gamma distributions is revealed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of a small heterogeneous chain network of neurons in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonlinear bidirectionally coupled heterogeneous chain network whose dynamics evolve in discrete time. The backbone of the model is a pair of popular map-based neuron models, the Chialvo and the Rulkov maps. This model is assumed to proximate the intricate dynamical properties of neurons in the widely complex nervous system. The model is first realized via various nonlinear analysis techniques: fixed point analysis, phase portraits, Jacobian matrix, and bifurcation diagrams. We observe the coexistence of chaotic and period-4 attractors. Various codimension-1 and -2 patterns for example saddle-node, period-doubling, Neimark-Sacker, double Neimark-Sacker, flip- and fold-Neimark Sacker, and 1:1 and 1:2 resonance are also explored. Furthermore, the study employs two synchronization measures to quantify how the oscillators in the network behave in tandem with each other over a long number of iterations. Finally, a time series analysis of the model is performed to investigate its complexity in terms of sample entropy.</description>

      <title>Attochaos I: The classically chaotic postcursor of high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond physics provides unique insights into light-matter interaction on ultrafast time scales. Its core phenomenon, High Harmonic Generation (HHG), is often described by a classical recollision model, the simple-man or three-step model, where the atomic potential is disregarded. Many features are already well explained using this model; however, the simplicity of the model does not allow the possibility of classical chaotic motion. We show that beyond this model, classical chaotic motion does exist albeit on timescales that are generally longer than the first recollision time. Chaos is analyzed using tools from the theory of dynamical systems, such as Lyapunov exponents and stroboscopic maps. The calculations are done for a one-dimensional Coulomb potential subjected to a linearly polarized electric field.</description>

      <title>Energy-based theory of autoresonance in chains of coupled damped-driven generic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An energy-based theory of autoresonance in driven dissipative chains of coupled generic oscillators is discussed on the basis of a variational principle concerning the energy functional. The theory is applied to chains of delayed Duffing-Ueda oscillators and the equations that together govern the autoresonance forces and solutions are derived and solved analytically for generic values of parameters and initial conditions, including the case of quenched time-delay disorder. Remarkably, the presence of retarded potentials with time-delayed feedback drastically modify the autoresonance scenario preventing the growth of the energy oscillation over specific regions of the parameter space. Additionally, effective harmonic forces with a slowly varying frequency are derived from the exact autoresonant excitations and the effectiveness of the theory is demonstrated at suppressing the chaos induced by homogeneous periodic excitations in such oscillator chains. Numerical experiments confirmed all the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Recurrence analysis of meteorological data from climate zones in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study on the spatio-temporal pattern underlying the climate dynamics in various locations spread over India, including the Himalayan region, coastal region, central and northeastern parts of India. We try to capture the variations in the complexity of their dynamics derived from temperature and relative humidity data from 1948-2022. By estimating the recurrence-based measures from the reconstructed phase space dynamics using a sliding window analysis on the data sets, we study the climate variability in different spatial locations. The study brings out the variations in the complexity of the underlying dynamics as well as their heterogeneity across the locations in India. We find almost all locations indicate shifts to more irregular and stochastic dynamics for temperature data around 1972-79 and shifts back to more regular dynamics beyond 2000. These patterns correlate with reported shifts in the climate and Indian Summer Monsoon related to strong and moderate ENSO events and confirm their associated regional variability.</description>
