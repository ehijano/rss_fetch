      <title>SYNAPSE: Synergizing an Adapter and Finetuning for High-Fidelity EEG Synthesis from a CLIP-Aligned Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based generative models has enabled high-quality image synthesis conditioned on diverse modalities. Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation.</description>

      <title>Semantic-driven Wireless Environment Knowledge Representation for Efficiency-Accuracy Balanced Beam Prediction in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the internet of vehicles demands ultra-reliable low-latency communication in high-mobility environments, where conventional beam prediction methods suffer from high-dimensional inputs, prolonged training times, and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, the propagation environment semantics-aware wireless environment knowledge beam prediction (PES-WEKBP) framework is proposed. PES-WEKBP pioneers a novel electromagnetic (EM)-grounded knowledge distillation method, transforming raw visual data into an ultra-lean, interpretable material and location-related wireless environment knowledge matrix. This matrix explicitly encodes critical propagation environment semantics, which is material EM properties and spatial relationships through a physics-informed parameterization process, distilling the environment and channel interplay into a minimal yet information-dense representation. A lightweight decision network then leverages this highly compressed knowledge for low-complexity beam prediction. To holistically evaluate the performance of PES-WEKBP, we first design the prediction consistency-efficiency index (PCEI), which combines prediction accuracy with a stability-penalized logarithmic training time to ensure a balanced optimization of reliability and computational efficiency. Experiments validate that PES-WEKBP achieves a 99.75% to 99.96% dimension reduction and improves accuracy by 5.52% to 8.19%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PCEI scores across diverse vehicular scenarios.</description>

      <title>WaveC2R: Wavelet-Driven Coarse-to-Refined Hierarchical Learning for Radar Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.</description>

      <title>OFDM-ISAC Beyond CP Limit: Performance Analysis and Mitigation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is well-suited for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), yet its cyclic prefix (CP) is dimensioned for communications-grade multipath and is generally insufficient for sensing. When echoes exceed the CP duration, inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISI/ICI) break subcarrier orthogonality and degrade sensing. This paper presents a unified analytical and algorithmic framework for OFDM-ISAC beyond the CP limit. We first develop a general echo model that explicitly captures the structured coupling of ISI and ICI caused by CP insufficiency. Building on this model, we derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the range-Doppler peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR), both of which are shown to deteriorate approximately linearly with the normalized excess delay beyond the CP. To mitigate these effects, we propose two standard-compatible successive interference cancellation (SIC) methods: SIC-DFT, a low-complexity DFT-based scheme, and SIC-ESPRIT, a super-resolution subspace approach. Simulations corroborate the analysis and demonstrate consistent gains over representative benchmarks. Both algorithms provide more than $4$dB SINR improvement under CP-insufficient conditions, while SIC-ESPRIT reduces range/velocity root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) by about one order of magnitude, approaching the performance achievable with a sufficiently long CP. These results offer both theoretical insight and practical solutions for reliable long-range OFDM-ISAC sensing beyond the CP limit.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Dual-Antenna Repeater Assisted Bi-Static MIMO ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for target detection and downlink data transmission in a repeater-assisted bi-static integrated sensing and communication system. A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station. In particular, our finding is that a higher value of probability of detection can be attained with considerably lower target radar-cross-section variance by deploying repeaters in the target hot-spot areas.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM) Modulation for High Mobility Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-carrier modulation framework for high-mobility communication scenarios. Our key idea lies in spreading data symbols across the delay-Doppler (DD) domain through orthogonal chirp-Zak transform (CZT). To enable efficient signal multiplexing, the proposed modulation scheme employs a transmitter signal that maintains orthogonality with the inherent resolution characteristics of the DD plane. Termed as Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM), we demonstrate a synergistic integration of chirp waveform properties with the channel structure of the DD domain, thereby achieving advantages with both lower computational efficiency and improved detection performance. We introduce a novel CZT-based superimposed sparse pilot structure to enable simultaneous estimation of delay-Doppler shifts and channel coefficients. For enhanced performance, we further develop an embedded pilot scheme that demonstrates channel estimation performance comparable to that of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that CDDM achieves significant bit error rate (BER) improvements over existing modulation schemes , under perfect channel state information (CSI), as well as superior out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Further, for the imperfect CSI case, the proposed CZT-based superimposed pilot scheme leads to significantly reduced normalized mean square error (NMSE), whilst attaining equivalent estimation accuracy to that of ODDM with lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided MU-MIMO mmWave Systems with Direct Channel Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a three-stage unified channel estimation strategy for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) systems with the existence of the direct channels, where the base station (BS), the users and the RIS are equipped with uniform planar array (UPA). The effectiveness of the developed three-stage strategy stems from the careful design of both the pilot signal sequence of the users and the vectors of RIS. Specifically, in Stage I, the cascaded channel components are eliminated by configuring the RIS phase shift vectors with a {\pi} difference to estimate the direct channels for all users. The orthogonal subspace projection is employed in Stage II to obtain equivalent signal matrices, enabling the estimation of angles of departure (AoDs) of the user-RIS channel for all users. In Stage III, we combine the signals of the time slots with the same pilots and project obtained measurement matrix to the orthogonal complement space of the component consisting of the portion of the direct channel, which removes the direct components and thus prevents error propagation from the direct channels to the cascaded channels. Then, we estimate the angles of arrival (AoAs) of the RIS-BS channel and remaining parameters of the cascaded channel for all users by exploiting the sparsity and correlation in the obtained equivalent matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method yields better estimation performance than the existing methods.</description>

      <title>CT-CFAR A Robust CFAR Detector Based on CLEAN and Truncated Statistics in Sidelobe-Contaminated Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) target detection algorithm based on the CLEAN concept and truncated statistics to mitigate the non-homogeneity of reference samples caused by sidelobe contamination and other abnormal interferences within the reference window. The proposed algorithm employs truncated statistics to separate target and noise components in the radar echo power spectrum, thereby restoring the homogeneity assumption of the reference window. In addition, learnable historical sidelobe information is introduced to enhance the robustness and environmental adaptability of the detection process. Furthermore, based on multichannel echo data, a target reconstruction model that combines the Candan algorithm with least-squares estimation is established, incorporating the CLEAN concept to suppress sidelobe interference. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world measurement experiments demonstrate that the proposed CT-CFAR algorithm achieves high-precision target detection without requiring prior knowledge of abnormal samples. Compared with various CFAR algorithms, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of the reference window, accurately estimates the noise spectrum, and exhibits superior detection performance and computational efficiency in complex scenarios affected by sidelobe contamination.</description>

      <title>BeamCKM: A Framework of Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18376v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel knowledge map (CKM) enables efficient construction of high-fidelity mapping between spatial environments and channel parameters via electromagnetic information analysis. Nevertheless, existing studies are largely confined to single-antenna systems, failing to offer dedicated guidance for multi-antenna communication scenarios. To address the inherent conflict between traditional real-value pathloss map and multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) coherent beamforming in B5G/6G systems, this paper proposes a novel concept of BeamCKM and CKMTransUNet architecture. The CKMTransUNet approach combines a UNet backbone for multi-scale feature extraction with a vision transformer (ViT) module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors, utilizing a composite loss function to characterize the beam propagation characteristics. Furthermore, based on the CKMTransUNet backbone, this paper presents a methodology named M3ChanNet. It leverages the multi-modal learning technique and cross-attention mechanisms to extract intrinsic side information from environmental profiles and real-time multi-beam observations, thereby further improving the map construction accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) interpolation methods and deep learning (DL) approaches, delivering superior performance even when environmental contours are inaccurate. For reproducibility, the code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/github-whh/BeamCKM.</description>

      <title>AutoMAS: A Generic Multi-Agent System for Algorithm Self-Adaptation in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wireless communication environment has the characteristic of strong dynamics. Conventional wireless networks operate based on the static rules with predefined algorithms, lacking the self-adaptation ability. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provides a possibility for wireless networks to become more intelligent and fully automated. As such, we plan to integrate the cognitive capability and high intelligence of the emerging AI agents into wireless networks. In this work, we propose AutoMAS, a generic multi-agent system which can autonomously select the most suitable wireless optimization algorithm according to the dynamic wireless environment. Our AutoMAS combines theoretically guaranteed wireless algorithms with agents' perception ability, thereby providing sounder solutions to complex tasks no matter how the environment changes. As an example, we conduct a case study on the classical channel estimation problem, where the mobile user moves in diverse environments with different channel propagation characteristics. Simulation results demonstrate that our AutoMAS can guarantee the highest accuracy in changing scenarios. Similarly, our AutoMAS can be generalized to autonomously handle various tasks in 6G wireless networks with high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the use of enhanced Monte-Carlo (MC) techniques to evaluate the outage probability of single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) systems under Rician fading, in which the input is combined using generalized selection combining with maximum ratio combining (GSC/MRC). The studied set of methods includes previously established methods: universal importance sampling (UIS) and multilevel splitting (MLS), alongside readapted methods: exponential twisting (ET) and cross-entropy (CE), and a novel method introduced here: partition importance sampling (PIS). Performance is assessed across standard efficiency metrics, revealing that ET, CE, and PIS exhibit the best performance. CE is found to be the most robust method among them.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-to-cell connectivity between satellites and common terrestrial handheld devices represents an essential feature of 6G. The industry is considering different type of constellations but using classical single satellite solutions based on phased array antennas. This article proposes to decompose a classical single satellite into a swarm of multiple small platforms (e.g. CubeSats) each equipped with one or a small number of radiating elements. The platforms are spaced far apart to create a large virtual aperture. The use of small satellites promises cost reduction for production and launch, while the distributed nature of the system introduces interesting features, such as scalability and fault tolerance. This perspective article provides insights into the opportunities and a discussion of the research challenges for the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication and millimeter wave (mmWave) have emerged as pivotal technologies for 6G networks. However, the narrow nature of mmWave beams requires precise alignments that typically necessitate large training overhead. This overhead can be reduced by incorporating the position information with beam adjustments. This letter proposes a lightweight autorencoder (LAE) model that addresses the position-assisted beam prediction problem while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to the conventional baseline method, i.e., deep fully connected neural network. The proposed LAE is designed as a three-layer undercomplete network to exploit its dimensionality reduction capabilities and thereby mitigate the computational requirements of the trained model. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves a similar beam prediction accuracy to the baseline with an 83% complexity reduction.</description>

We present an interpretable model that integrates an established bag-of-words (BoW) topical representation and a novel LLM-based question answering (Q&amp;A) narrative model, which share a latent Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space representation, to quantify written documents. Our approach mitigates the cost, interpretability, and generalization challenges of using a LLM to analyze large corpora without full inference. We derive efficient functional gradient descent updates that are interpretable and structurally analogous to the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. We further introduce an in-context Q&amp;A extrapolation method inspired by Transformer architectures, enabling accurate prediction of Q&amp;A outcomes for unqueried documents.</description>

      <title>LLM4AMC: Adapting Large Language Models for Adaptive Modulation and Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is a key technology in 5G new radio (NR), enabling dynamic link adaptation by balancing transmission efficiency and reliability based on channel conditions. However, traditional methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the aging issues of channel quality indicator (CQI). Recently, the emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in contextual understanding and temporal modeling naturally align with the dynamic channel adaptation requirements of AMC technology. Leveraging pretrained LLMs, we propose a channel quality prediction method empowered by LLMs to optimize AMC, termed LLM4AMC. We freeze most parameters of the LLM and fine-tune it to fully utilize the knowledge acquired during pretraining while better adapting it to the AMC task. We design a network architecture composed of four modules, a preprocessing layer, an embedding layer, a backbone network, and an output layer, effectively capturing the time-varying characteristics of channel quality to achieve accurate predictions of future channel conditions. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves link performance and exhibits potential for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Sparse Bayesian Channel Estimation and Tracking for XL-IRS-Aided Wideband mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of 6G systems demands advanced technologies to boost network capacity and spectral efficiency, particularly in the context of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. A key challenge here is obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), especially with extremely large IRS (XL-IRS), due to near-field propagation, high-dimensional wideband cascaded channels, and the passive nature of the XL-IRS. In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing. Simulation results demonstrate that the TS-CET framework significantly improves the estimation accuracy and reduces the pilot overhead as compared to existing benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Nonlinear Transform Coding: A Framework for Generalizable Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes robust nonlinear transform coding (Robust-NTC), a generalizable digital joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework that couples variational latent modeling with channel adaptive transmission. Unlike learning-based JSCC methods that implicitly absorb channel variations, Robust-NTC explicitly models element-wise latent distributions via a variational objective with a Gaussian proxy for quantization and channel noise, allowing encoder-decoder to capture latent uncertainty without channel-specific training. Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets. Simulation results demonstrate that for practical OFDM systems, Robust-NTC achieves superior rate-distortion efficiency and stable reconstruction fidelity compared to digital JSCC baselines across wide-ranging SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>Semi-Passive IRS Enabled Sensing with Group Movable Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the sensing system is limited by the signal attenuation and the number of receiving components. In this letter, we investigate the sensor position selection in a semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing system. The IRS consists of passive elements and active sensors, where the sensors can receive and process the echo signal for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Motivated by the movable antenna array and fluid antenna system, we consider the case where the sensors are integrated into a group for movement and derive the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Then, the optimal solution for the positions of the movable sensors (MSs) to the CRB minimization problem is derived in closed form. Moreover, we characterize the relationship between the CRB and system parameters. Theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MS scheme over the fixed-position (FP) scheme.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Array Enhanced Multi-Target Sensing: CRB Characterization and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless communication and sensing performance towards sixth-generation (6G) networks through flexible antenna movement. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless sensing system based on MA arrays to enhance multi-target spatial angle estimation performance. We begin by characterizing the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multi-target angle of arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the antenna's positions in MA arrays, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for antenna position optimization. Then, aiming at improving the sensing coverage performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expectation of the trace of the CRB matrix over random target angles subject to a given distribution by optimizing the antennas' positions. To tackle the formulated challenging optimization problem, the Monte Carlo method is employed to approximate the intractable objective function, and a swarm-based gradient descent algorithm is subsequently proposed to address the approximated problem. In addition, a lower-bound on the sum of CRBs for multi-target AoA estimation is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-based design achieves superior sensing performance compared to conventional systems using fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and single-target-oriented MA arrays, in terms of decreasing both CRB and the actual AoA estimation mean square error (MSE). Fundamentally, the designed MA array geometry exhibits low correlation and high effective power of sensitivity vectors for multi-target sensing in the angular domain, leading to significant CRB performance improvement. The resultant low correlation of steering vectors over multiple targets' directions further helps mitigate angle estimation ambiguity and thus enhances MSE performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Probabilistic Constellation Shaping based on Enumerative Sphere Shaping for FSO Channel with Turbulence and Pointing Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) transmission enables fast, secure, and efficient next-generation communications with abundant spectrum resources. However, atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, path loss, and atmospheric loss induce random attenuation, challenging link reliability. Adaptive rate control technology enhances spectrum utilization and reliability. We propose an adaptive probabilistic constellation shaping (A-PCS) coherent system utilizing enumerated spherical shaping (ESS) for distribution matching. With PCS-64QAM, the system achieves continuous rate control from conventional QPSK-equivalent to 64QAM spectral efficiency, providing quasi-continuous control with granularities of approximately $0.05$~bits/4D for spectral efficiency and $0.1$~dB for the post-FEC SNR threshold, and a maximum control depth of $12.5$~dB. Leveraging ESS for efficient sequence utilization, it offers higher spectral utilization and finer control granularity than constant composition DM (CCDM)-based A-PCS systems. We further model and analyze the FSO channel, presenting calculations and comparisons of outage probability and ergodic capacity under varying turbulence intensities and pointing errors. Results demonstrate 99.999~\% reliability at maximum $\sigma_\mathrm{R}^2 = 1.39$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{s} = 0.5~\mathrm{m}$, meeting requirements under severe turbulence and large pointing errors.</description>

      <title>Development of a Transit-Time Ultrasonic Flow Measurement System for Partially Filled Pipes: Incorporating Flow Profile Correction Factor and Real-Time Clogging Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow measurement in partially filled pipes presents greater complexity compared to fully filled systems, primarily due to the complex velocity distribution within the cross-section, which is a key source of measurement inaccuracy. To address this challenge, an ultrasonic flow meter was designed and developed, capable of simultaneously measuring both flow velocity and fluid level. To improve measurement accuracy, a flow profile correction factor (FPCF) was derived based on the velocity distribution characteristics and applied to the raw flow meter output. A dedicated open-channel flow loop incorporating a 250 mm diameter pipe was constructed to test and calibrate the system under controlled conditions. Flow rates in the loop varied from 2 to 6 liters per second. The accuracy of the flow meter was evaluated using the Flow-Weighted Mean Error (FWME) metric. Experimental results showed that applying the FPCF significantly improved accuracy, reducing the maximum flow measurement error from 8.51% to 2.44%. Furthermore, calibration led to a substantial decrease in FWME from 1.78% to 0.08%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flow meter was also subjected to clogging scenarios by artificially obstructing the flow. Under these conditions, the device was able to reliably measure the flow and successfully detected the clogging, triggering an alarm to the operator to take necessary action.</description>

      <title>Secure Beamforming Design for IRS-ISAC Systems with a Hardware-Efficient Hybrid Beamforming Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HB) architecture to achieve balanced performance in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. We consider a scenario where a multi-antenna, dual-function base station (BS) performs secure beamforming for a multi-antenna legitimate receiver while simultaneously detecting potential targets. Our objective is to maximize the communication secrecy gap by jointly optimizing the analog and digital beamformers, IRS reflection coefficients, and radar scaling factor, subject to constraints on beampattern similarity, total transmit power budget, and the constant modulus of both the analog beamformer and IRS reflection coefficients. This secrecy gap maximization problem is generally non-convex. To address this, we incorporate the exterior penalty method by adding the radar constraint as a penalty term in the objective function. We then propose an efficient approach based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework to solve the reformulated problem, featuring closed-form solutions at each step and guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the IRS-ISAC system with HB architecture in balancing performance and hardware costs.</description>

      <title>Secure Analog Beamforming for Multi-user MISO Systems with Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) represent a novel approach that enables flexible adjustments to antenna positions, effectively altering the channel environment and thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Aware Task Offloading for Remote Northern Regions: a Hybrid LEO-MEO Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arctic regions, such as northern Canada, face significant challenges in achieving consistent connectivity and low-latency computing services due to the sparse coverage of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. To enhance service reliability in remote areas, this paper proposes a hybrid satellite architecture for task offloading that combines Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and LEO satellites. We develop an optimization framework to maximize task offloading admission rate while balancing the energy consumption and delay requirements. Accounting for satellite visibility and limited computing resources, our approach integrates dynamic path selection with frequency and computational resource allocation. Because the formulated problem is NP-hard, we reformulate it into a mixed-integer convex form using disjunctive constraints and convex relaxation techniques, enabling efficient use of off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Simulation results show that, compared to a standalone LEO network, the proposed hybrid LEO-MEO architecture improves the task admission rate by 15\% and reduces the average delay by 12\%. These findings highlight the architecture's potential to enhance connectivity and user experience in remote Arctic areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.</description>

      <title>REXO: Indoor Multi-View Radar Object Detection via 3D Bounding Box Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Resource Allocation in Uplink Carrier Aggregation in the Presence of Self Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.</description>

Abstract: Current models treat physiological signals as noise corrupting neural computation. Previously, we showed that removing these "artifacts" eliminates 70% of predictive correlation, suggesting body signals functionally drive cognition. Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition.
  Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p&lt;0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.
  Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.
  Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration. This architecture may fundamentally distinguish biological from artificial intelligence.

      <title>Physically Informed Bayesian Retrieval of SWE and Snow Depth in Forested Areas from Airborne X And Ku-Band SAR Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a coupled physical statistical framework for retrieving snow water equivalent (SWE) in forested areas using dual frequency X and Ku band SAR observations. The method combines a multilayer snow hydrology model (MSHM) with microwave propagation and backscatter models, and includes a canopy parameterization based on a modified Water Cloud Model that accounts for canopy closure. The framework is applied to airborne SnowSAR measurements over Grand Mesa, Colorado, and evaluated against snow pit SWE and LiDAR snow depth from the SnowEx'17 campaign. Prior distributions of snowpack properties are generated with MSHM forced by numerical weather prediction, and vegetation and soil parameters are initialized from Ku HH observations under frozen conditions and interpolated from open to nearby forested areas using kriging. Successful SWE and snow depth retrievals in forested pixels are obtained where relative backscatter residuals are below 30% for incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, capturing both the mean and variance of snowpack distributions. For 90 m forested pixels, the snow depth RMSE is 0.033 m (less than 8% of maximum pit SWE), with improved spatial patterns relative to hydrology only simulations. Performance degrades in highly heterogeneous land cover such as mixed forest and wetlands and along canopy and water boundaries due to uncertainty in canopy closure, although absolute snow depth differences remain below 10% and 20% for about 62% and 82% of pixels, respectively. Retrievals at 30 m resolution for one flight further reduce spatial errors and increase the fraction of low error pixels by about 78% at a 10% absolute error threshold, demonstrating the feasibility of dual frequency Bayesian SWE retrievals in forested landscapes by combining physical modeling with SAR observations.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Dual RIS-Assisted Received Space Shift Keying Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are gaining traction for their ability to reshape wireless environments with low energy consumption. However, prior studies primarily explore single-RIS deployments with static or semi-static reflection control. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-RIS-assisted architecture for smart indoor wireless signal routing, wherein the second RIS (RIS$_2$) is dynamically configured based on source data bits to steer signals toward specific receivers or indoor zones. The first RIS (RIS$_1$), positioned near a fed antenna or access point, passively reflects the incident signal. RIS$_2$, equipped with a lightweight controller, performs bit-driven spatial modulation to enable data-dependent direction selection at the physical layer. We develop a complete end-to-end system model, including multi-hop channel representation, RIS phase configuration mapping, and signal detection based on space shift keying (SSK). Performance analysis is evaluated in terms of achievable capacity and outage probability under varying inter-RIS distances and carrier frequencies.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Deep Equilibrium Models for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant imaging (EI) enables training signal reconstruction models without requiring ground truth data by leveraging signal symmetries. Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) are a powerful class of neural networks where the output is a fixed point of a learned operator. However, training DEQs with complex EI losses requires implicit differentiation through fixed-point computations, whose implementation can be challenging. We show that backpropagation can be implemented modularly, simplifying training. Experiments demonstrate that DEQs trained with implicit differentiation outperform those trained with Jacobian-free backpropagation and other baseline methods. Additionally, we find evidence that EI-trained DEQs approximate the proximal map of an invariant prior.</description>

      <title>On the Tail Transition of First Arrival Position Channels: From Cauchy to Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the zero-drift First Arrival Position (FAP) channel is rigorously known to be Cauchy-distributed, practical molecular communication systems typically operate with non-zero drift. This letter characterizes the transition from heavy-tailed Cauchy behavior to light-tailed exponential decay. Through asymptotic analysis, we identify a critical spatial scale $n_c=\sigma^2/v$ separating diffusion- and drift-dominated regimes, revealing that the channel effectively behaves as a ``Truncated Cauchy'' model. Numerical results show that Gaussian approximations severely underestimate capacity at low drift, while the zero-drift case provides the appropriate performance lower bound for systems where drift assists particle transport.</description>

      <title>Directional Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a directional pinching-antenna system (DiPASS), a comprehensive framework that transitions PASS modeling from idealized abstraction to physical consistency. DiPASS introduces the first channel model that accurately captures the directional, pencil-like radiation of pinching antennas, incorporates a practical waveguide attenuation of 1.3 dB/m, and accounts for stochastic line-of-sight blockage. A key enabler of DiPASS is our new "equal quota division" power allocation strategy, which guarantees predetermined coupling lengths independent of antenna positions, thereby overcoming a critical barrier to practical deployment. Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Multi-Species Bird Soundscape Generation with Acoustic Patterning and 3D Spatialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.</description>

      <title>Confined Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Sparse Random Combinatorial Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal matching pursuit~(OMP) is a commonly used greedy algorithm for recovering sparse signals from compressed measurements. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the OMP algorithm to reduce the complexity of reconstructing a class of $K$-sparse signals $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ from measurements $\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}$. In particular, $\boldsymbol{A} \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ is a sparse random combinatorial matrix with independent columns, where each column is chosen uniformly among the vectors with exactly $d~(d \leq m/2)$ ones. The proposed algorithm, referred to as the confined OMP algorithm, leverages the properties of the sparse signal $\boldsymbol{x}$ and the measurement matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ to reduce redundancy in $\boldsymbol{A}$, thereby requiring fewer column indices to be identified. To this end, we first define a confined set $\Gamma$ with $|\Gamma| \leq n$ and then prove that the support of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ with probability 1 if the distributions of nonzero components of $\boldsymbol{x}$ satisfy a certain condition. During the process of the confined OMP algorithm, the possibly chosen column indices are strictly confined to the confined set $\Gamma$. We further develop the lower bound on the probability of exact recovery of $\boldsymbol{x}$ using the confined OMP algorithm. Furthermore, the obtained theoretical results can be used to optimize the column degree $d$ of $\boldsymbol{A}$. Finally, experimental results show that the confined OMP algorithm is more efficient in reconstructing a class of sparse signals compared to the OMP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Noncoherent Detection of Constant-Envelope Signals for Mobile Edge Applications -- Optimum Detectors and Intelligent Decision Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant-envelope signals are widely used in mobile edge applications and wireless communication systems for their hardware-friendly design, energy efficiency, and reliability. However, reliable detection with simple, power-efficient receivers remains challenging. Coherent methods offer superior performance but require complex synchronization, increasing complexity and power use. Noncoherent detection is simpler, avoiding synchronization, but traditional approaches rely on in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) demodulators for signal magnitudes and assume energy detectors without theoretical justification. This paper proposes a framework for optimal detection using a bandpass-filter envelope-detector (BFED) with Bayes criterion and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) under unknown amplitudes. Using modified Bessel function approximations, we show the optimal detector shifts based on SNR: in the low-SNR regime, we rigorously prove for the first time that the well-known energy detector (ED) is the Bayesian-optimal solution, thus providing a firm theoretical foundation for its widespread use; in high-SNR regimes, a novel amplitude detector (AD) compares estimated amplitude to noise deviation, leading to a simple yet optimal detection strategy. For unknown SNR, a reliability-based intelligent decision (RID) rule adaptively selects detectors, leveraging their strengths across SNR ranges. Simulations confirm energy and amplitude detectors minimize errors in their domains, with RID providing robust gains. The proposed framework provides a rigorous theoretical foundation and enables low-complexity implementations for resource-constrained, interference-limited mobile edge applications, including wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems.</description>

      <title>Smooth optimization using global and local low-rank regularizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many inverse problems and signal processing problems involve low-rank regularizers based on the nuclear norm. Commonly, proximal gradient methods (PGM) are adopted to solve this type of non-smooth problems as they can offer fast and guaranteed convergence. However, PGM methods cannot be simply applied in settings where low-rank models are imposed locally on overlapping patches; therefore, heuristic approaches have been proposed that lack convergence guarantees. In this work we propose to replace the nuclear norm with a smooth approximation in which a Huber-type function is applied to each singular value. By providing a theoretical framework based on singular value function theory, we show that important properties can be established for the proposed regularizer, such as: convexity, differentiability, and Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Moreover, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularizer gradient, enabling the use of standard iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., nonlinear conjugate gradient) that can easily address the case of overlapping patches and have well-known convergence guarantees. In addition, we provide a novel step-size selection strategy based on a quadratic majorizer of the line-search function that leverages the Huber characteristics of the proposed regularizer. Finally, we assess the proposed optimization framework by providing empirical results in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction in the context of local low-rank models with overlapping patches.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of range-migrating targets using OTFS signals from LEO satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration, henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Near and Far-Field Coexistence for RIS-Assisted ISAC Systems: An Adaptive Bandwidth Splitting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables the joint use of spectrum and hardware resources for radar sensing and data transmission, serving as a key enabler of next-generation wireless networks. However, most existing ISAC studies have been limited to operation within a single frequency band and have not been designed to adapt to diverse wireless propagation environments or user configurations. To address these limitations, this paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC system employing an adaptive bandwidth-splitting strategy under near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) coexistence. The system comprises a full-duplex access point (AP), an RIS and multiple users, where an ISAC user (IU) is both a sensing target and a communication user in the NF region, while communication-only users (CUs) rely on the RIS and experience either NF or FF propagation depending on their placement. The proposed system jointly exploits traditional sensing-only (SO) and ISAC bands and adopts uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for simultaneous transmission. We formulate a joint optimization problem for the receive beamforming vector, bandwidth-splitting ratio, and RIS phase shifts to minimize the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) under rate and resource constraints. An efficient algorithm is developed based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework combined with semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional schemes that operate solely in either the ISAC or SO band, achieving superior performance across various RIS and user configurations under hybrid NF and FF coexistence scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented demands on wireless infrastructure to accommodate large-scale drone deployments and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However, unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing, computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management, providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.</description>

      <title>Covert Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication System in Clutter Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system covert waveform design method for complex clutter environments, with the core objective of maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects. To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also achieves superior target detection performance. It also ensures reliable communication and confirms the effectiveness of propose method.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. Proposed complementary analyses indicate that the individuality is primarily encoded in the QRS features across all four domains. BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude and slope, providing supportive, but less stable, discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation can be traced to stable inter-individual differences in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry. The potential in the clinical environment, particularly for systems in which patient identification depends on robust physiology-based markers.</description>

      <title>Fair Rate Maximization for Multi-User Multi-Cell MISO Communication Systems via Novel Transmissive RIS Transceiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver configuration. Within this system framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming of the TRIS transceiver, subject to the power constraints of each TRIS transceiver unit. Since the objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM) technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear superiority of the deployment of the TRIS transceiver over the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Scale Absolute Carrier Phase-Based Localization in Multi-Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization is a key feature of future Sixth Generation (6G) net-works with foreseen accuracy requirements down to the millimeter level, to enable novel applications in the fields of telesurgery, high-precision manufacturing, and others. Currently, such accuracy requirements are only achievable with specialized or highly resource-demanding systems, rendering them impractical for more wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we present the first system that enables low-complexity and low-bandwidth absolute 3D localization with millimeter-level accuracy in generic wireless networks. It performs a carrier phase-based wireless localization refinement of an initial location estimate based on successive location-likelihood optimization across multiple bands. Unlike previous phase unwrapping methods, our solution is one-shot. We evaluate its performance collecting ~350, 000 measurements, showing an improvement of more than one order of magnitude over classical localization techniques. Finally, we will open-source the low-cost, modular FR3 front-end that we developed for the experimental campaign.</description>

      <title>Beamforming for Transmissive RIS Transceiver Enabled Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-empowered simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with multiple information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) users. Under the considered system model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the sum-rate of all ID users via the design of the TRIS transceiver's active beamforming. The design is constrained by per-antenna power limits at the TRIS transceiver and by the minimum harvested energy demand of all EH users. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and the energy harvesting constraint, the sum-rate problem is difficult to tackle. To solve this challenging optimization problem, by leveraging the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) framework and the majorization-minimization (MM) method, we propose a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based algorithm. Per-element power constraints introduce a large number of constraints, making the problem considerably more difficult. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method, we successfully develop an analytical, computationally efficient, and highly parallelizable algorithm to address this challenge. Numerical results are provided to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, the low-complexity algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity without performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Secure Analog Beamforming Design for Wireless Communication Systems With Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MA) are a novel technology that allows for the flexible adjustment of antenna positions within a specified region, thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore the use of MA to improve physical layer security in an analog beamforming (AB) communication system. Our goal is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit AB and MA position, subject to constant modulus (CM) constraints on the AB and position constraints for the MA. The resulting problem is non-convex, and we propose a penalty product manifold (PPM) method to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we convert the inequality constraints related to MA position into a penalty function using smoothing techniques, thereby reformulating the problem as an unconstrained optimization on the product manifold space (PMS). We then derive a parallel conjugate gradient descent (PCGD) algorithm to update both the AB and MA position on the PMS. This method is efficient, providing an analytical solution at each step and ensuring convergence to a KKT point. Simulation results show that the MA system achieves a higher secrecy rate than systems with fixed-position antennas.</description>

      <title>A Review of Machine Learning for Cavitation Intensity Recognition in Complex Industrial Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) is a critical technology for detecting and evaluating cavitation phenomena in hydraulic machinery, with significant implications for operational safety, performance optimization, and maintenance cost reduction in complex industrial systems. Despite substantial research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge. This provides a significant reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of intelligent cavitation diagnosis in complex industrial systems.</description>

Abstract: Smart cities will be characterized by a variety of intelligent and networked services, each with specific requirements for the underlying network infrastructure. While smart city architectures and services have been studied extensively, little attention has been paid to the network technology. The KIGLIS research project, consisting of a consortium of companies, universities and research institutions, focuses on artificial intelligence for optimizing fiber-optic networks of a smart city, with a special focus on future mobility applications, such as automated driving. In this paper, we present early results on our process of collecting smart city requirements for communication networks, which will lead towards reference infrastructure and architecture solutions. Finally, we suggest directions in which artificial intelligence will improve smart city networks.</description>

      <title>Compressing Sensor Data for Remote Assistance of Autonomous Vehicles using Deep Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.03201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the foreseeable future, autonomous vehicles will require human assistance in situations they can not resolve on their own. In such scenarios, remote assistance from a human can provide the required input for the vehicle to continue its operation. Typical sensors used in autonomous vehicles include camera and lidar sensors. Due to the massive volume of sensor data that must be sent in real-time, highly efficient data compression is elementary to prevent an overload of network infrastructure. Sensor data compression using deep generative neural networks has been shown to outperform traditional compression approaches for both image and lidar data, regarding compression rate as well as reconstruction quality. However, there is a lack of research about the performance of generative-neural-network-based compression algorithms for remote assistance. In order to gain insights into the feasibility of deep generative models for usage in remote assistance, we evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms regarding their applicability and identify potential weaknesses. Further, we implement an online pipeline for processing sensor data and demonstrate its performance for remote assistance using the CARLA simulator.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Model for Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting tries to precisely predict the air quality multiple hours ahead for the entire city. This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Powered Plugin for Robust Federated Learning in Heterogeneous IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model while maintaining data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the Non-IID nature of data distribution across devices often hinders model convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plugin for federated optimization methods that approximates Non-IID data distributions to IID through generative AI-enhanced data augmentation and balanced sampling strategy. The key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient-Tracking with Finite-Time Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for decentralized optimization and learning rely on local optimization steps coupled with combination steps over a graph. Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieves finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm. Our results hold for any periodic sequence of combination matrices. We clarify the interplay between approximation error of the finite-time consensus sequence and the length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise.</description>

      <title>B2LoRa: Boosting LoRa Transmission for Satellite-IoT Systems with Blind Coherent Combining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, satellite-IoT systems using the LoRa technique have been increasingly deployed to provide widespread Internet services to low-power and low-cost ground devices. However, the long transmission distance and adverse environments from IoT satellites to ground devices pose a huge challenge to link reliability, as evidenced by the measurement results based on our real-world setup. In this paper, we propose a blind coherent combining design named B2LoRa to boost LoRa transmission performance. The intuition behind B2LoRa is to leverage the repeated broadcasting mechanism inherent in satellite-IoT systems to achieve coherent combining under the low-power and low-cost constraints, where each re-transmission at different times is regarded as the same packet transmitted from different antenna elements within an antenna array. Then, the problem is translated into aligning these packets at a fine granularity despite the time, frequency, and phase offsets between packets in the case of frequent packet loss. To overcome this challenge, we present three designs - joint packet sniffing, frequency shift alignment, and phase drift mitigation to deal with ultra-low SNRs and Doppler shifts featured in satellite-IoT systems, respectively. Finally, experiment results based on our real-world deployments demonstrate the high efficiency of B2LoRa.</description>

      <title>Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/TemporalMorphing/EnvelopeMorphing.</description>

      <title>Forecasting-based Biomedical Time-series Data Synthesis for Open Data and Robust AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and significant resource demands severely constrains biomedical time-series AI development, which creates a critical gap between data requirements and accessibility. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. While GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models capture global data distributions, forecasting models offer inductive biases tailored for sequential dynamics. We propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based on recent forecasting models that accurately replicates complex electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These synthetic datasets can be freely shared for open AI development and consistently improve downstream model performance. Numerical results on sleep-stage classification show up to a 3.71\% performance gain with augmentation and a 91.00\% synthetic-only accuracy that surpasses the real-data-only baseline.</description>

      <title>Metaplectic time-frequency representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09322</link>

Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Smooth Total variation Regularization for Interference Detection and Elimination (STRIDE) for MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MRI is increasingly desired to function near electronic devices that emit potentially dynamic electromagnetic interference (EMI). To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Automatic Differentiation of Direct Form Digital Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general formulation for automatic differentiation through direct form filters, yielding a closed-form backpropagation that includes initial condition gradients. The result is a single expression that can represent both the filter and its gradients computation while supporting parallelism. C++/CUDA implementations in PyTorch achieve at least 1000x speedup over naive Python implementations and consistently run fastest on the GPU. For the low-order filters commonly used in practice, exact time-domain filtering with analytical gradients outperforms the frequency-domain method in terms of speed. The source code is available at https://github.com/yoyolicoris/philtorch.</description>
