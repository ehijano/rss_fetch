      <title>Drug Washout and Viral Rebound: Modeling HIV Reactivation Under ART Discontinuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the persistence of latently infected CD4$^+$ T cells, achieving a functional cure for HIV-1 remains a significant challenge since the viruses are able to evade immune clearance, which in turn enables post-treatment viral rebound. Because traditional deterministic models assume a constant reactivation rate, they fail to capture the stochastic nature of latency reversal influenced by immune perturbations and ART pharmacokinetics. Thus, in this study, by using a Poisson-driven stochastic framework that incorporates fluctuations in activation rates, we study viral rebound dynamics. Via an exponentially decreasing drug washout model, we accurately quantifies the nonlinear interplay between ART decay and stochastic reactivation, improving the theoretical estimates of post-treatment control. Beyond the introduction of stochasticity, our model establishes a time-dependent viral reactivation framework that integrates periodic and random perturbations in the activation rates. Unlike conventional models that assume uniform (temporally independent reactivation), we show that latency reversal follows structured oscillatory patterns modulated by immune cycles, circadian rhythms, and transient inflammatory episodes. This finding suggests that viral rebound risk is dynamically shaped by immune fluctuations, contrary to the assumption of a constant reactivation probability. We also study the model system by incorporating Gamma-distributed waiting times to account for heterogeneity in reactivation kinetics, which in turn provides a more flexible characterization of reservoir dynamics. We believe that these insights have critical implications for HIV cure strategies.</description>

      <title>Seasonal footprints on ecological time series and jumps in dynamic states of protein configurations from a non-linear forecasting method characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13811v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and protein configurations from molecular dynamics simulations with the nonlinear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara. Our primary focus in this work is to characterize the dynamic state of a system by quantifying prediction quality from data. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality $E$ and forecasting time $T_p$, the two basic parameters of the method, give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. We detect changes in protein dynamics due to mutations and, regarding ecology data, we show how cycles and {\it rhythms} of the environment manifests in parameter space $(E,T_p)$ for some species.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of chemical reaction networks: Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information geometry is based on classical Legendre duality but allows to incorporate additional structure such as algebraic constraints and Bregman divergence functions. It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used, to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on the Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where algebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the Riemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that duality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural parametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric tensors.
  In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced concept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is proven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent bundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and explicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal solutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system.
  The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal thermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular environments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the analyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to negative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly nonlinear reaction kinetics. However, here, they are obtained by tuning thermodynamical interactions providing a complementary, and physically well-founded, viewpoint on such phenomena.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows for microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent microfluidic experiments have explored the precise positioning of micron-sized particles in liquid environments via laser-induced thermoviscous flow. From micro-robotics to biology at the subcellular scale, this versatile technique has found a broad range of applications. Through the interplay between thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes, the repeated scanning of the laser along a scan path results in fluid flow and hence net transport of particles, without physical channels. Building on previous work focusing on two-dimensional microfluidic settings, we present an analytical, theoretical model for the thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows and net transport induced by a translating heat spot in three-dimensional, unconfined fluid. We first numerically solve for the temperature field due to a translating heat source in the experimentally relevant limit. Then, in our flow model, the small, localised temperature increase causes local changes in the mass density, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity of the fluid. We derive analytically the instantaneous flow generated during one scan and compute the net transport of passive tracers due to a full scan, up to quadratic order in the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. We further show that the flow and transport are independent of bulk viscosity. In the far field, while the leading-order instantaneous flow is typically a three-dimensional source or sink, the leading-order average velocity of tracers is instead a source dipole, whose strength depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. Our quantitative results reveal the potential for future three-dimensional net transport and manipulation of particles at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Loop Stabilization in Periodically Driven Elastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network remodeling, or adaptation, in the presence of periodically driven forcings has hereto remained largely unexplored, despite the fact that a broad class of biological transport networks, e.g. animal vasculature, depends on periodic driving (pulsatility of the heart) to maintain flow. Short-term pulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of adapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile flows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for periodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of short-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales. Using this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of looping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at steady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the geometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the network. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the stabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the source, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less structures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a mechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy network architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically relevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion homogenization.</description>

      <title>Excitability and travelling waves in renewable active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.</description>

      <title>The modelling of the action potentials in myelinated nerve fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the propagation of an axon potential (AP) in unmyelinated axons. In many cases the axons have a myelin sheath and the experimental studies have then revealed significant changes in the velocity of APs. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed describing the AP propagation in myelinated axons. As far as the velocity of an AP is affected, the basis of the model is taken after Lieberstein, who included the possible effect of inductance that might influence velocity, into the governing equation. The proposed model includes the structural properties of the myelin sheath: the $\mu$-factor (the ratio of the length of the myelin sheath and the Ranvier node) and g-ratio (the ratio of the inner-to-outer diameter of a myelinated axon) through parameter $\gamma$. It is demonstrated that the Lieberstein model can describe all the essential effects characteristic to the formation and propagation of an AP in an unmyelinated axon. Then a phenomenological model for a myelinated axon is described including the influence of the structural properties of the myelin sheath and the radius of an axon. The numerical simulation using the physical variables demonstrates the changes in the velocity of an AP as well as the changes in its profile. These results match well the known effects from experimental studies.</description>
