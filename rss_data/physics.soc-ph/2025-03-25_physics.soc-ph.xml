      <title>Choice Sets and Smart Card Data In Public Transport Route Choice Models: Generated vs. Empirical Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates path sets generation for route choice models in multimodal public transportation networks, using both conventional (network algorithms) and empirical (smart card data driven) methods. While the empirical approach can present limitations with a short observation period, it improves substantially with more data, offering a computational efficiency advantage over conventional methods. In such approach, while incorporating real-world delays increased travel time variability, it still aligned with planned travel times, and relaxing access/egress assumptions further enhanced coverage. Work is undergoing on the evaluation of the impact of different choice sets in bias and efficiency of route choice parameter estimates.</description>

      <title>A Review of Urban Resilience Frameworks: Transferring Knowledge to Enhance Pandemic Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urbanization is rapidly increasing, with urban populations expected to grow significantly by 2050, particularly in developing regions. This expansion brings challenges related to chronic stresses and acute shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has underscored the critical role of urban form in a city's capacity to manage public health crises. Despite the heightened interest in urban resilience, research examining the relationship between urban morphology and pandemic resilience remains limited, often focusing solely on density and its effect on disease transmission. This work aims to address this gap by evaluating existing frameworks that analyze the relationship between urban resilience and urban form. By critically reviewing these frameworks, with a particular emphasis on theoretical and quantitative approaches, this study seeks to transfer the knowledge gained to better understand the relationship between pandemic resilience and urban morphology. The work also links theoretical ideas with quantitative frameworks, offering a cohesive analysis. The anticipated novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive assessment of urban resilience frameworks and the identification of the current gaps in integrating resilience to pandemic thinking into urban planning and design. The goal is not only to enhance the understanding of urban resilience but also to offer practical guidance for developing more adaptive and effective frameworks for assessing resilience to pandemics in urban environments, thereby preparing cities to better withstand and recover from future crises.</description>

      <title>Critical misalignments in climate pledges reveal imbalanced sustainable development pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the integration of climate action and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in nationally determined contributions (NDCs), revealing persistent synergies and trade-offs across income groups. While high-income countries emphasize systemic challenges like health (SDG3) and inequality (SDG10), low-income nations prioritize the water-energy-food nexus (SDGs 6-7-12) and natural resource management (SDG15) due to vulnerabilities to climate impacts. Harnessing an innovative artificial intelligence routine, we discuss what these diverging development trajectories imply for the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development in terms of global inequality, the climate and sustainable finance flows and multilateral governance.</description>

      <title>Inequality and Mobility in a Minimal Model for Evolving Income Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the dynamic relationship between income inequality and economic mobility through a pairing of a population-scale partial differential equation (PDE) model and an associated individual-based stochastic differential equation (SDE) model. We focus on two fundamental mechanisms of income growth: (1) that annual growth is percentile-dependent, and (2) that there is intrinsic variability from one individual to the next. Under these two assumptions, we show that increased economic mobility does not necessarily imply decreased income inequality. In fact, we show that the mechanism that directly enhances mobility, intrinsic variability, simultaneously increases inequality.
  Using Growth Incidence Curves, and other summary statistics like mean income and the Gini coefficient, we calibrate our model to US Census data (1968-2021) and show that there are multiple parameter settings that produce the same growth in inequality over time. Strikingly, these parameter settings produce dramatically different mobility outcomes. Naturally, the greater disparity there is between annual percentage growth in the upper and lower income levels, the less ability there is for individuals to climb the percentile ranks over a fixed period of time. However, more than this, the model shows that whatever mobility does exist, it decreases substantially over time. In other words, while it may remain true that opportunity to reach the upper ranks mathematically persists in the long run, that long run gets longer and longer every year.</description>

      <title>The meaning of social complexity: insights from a theoretical treatment of the social brain hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work builds on a rich discourse surrounding the social brain hypothesis as well as the definition and quantification of social complexity. We believe this manuscript provides a new perspective on the topic by pairing a conceptual framework with an evolutionary model. This treatment of the topic allows us to analyse the social brain hypothesis with a focus on social complexity rather than controversies related to ecological covariates and brain measurements. We show that even in the confines of a simplified and idealized model, quantifying social complexity a priori can be intractable. As a result, we believe that we should generally approach metrics of social complexity with skepticism. This has general implications for empirical tests of the social brain hypothesis and practical implications for those trying to design a metric of social complexity. We provide recommendations for future researchers studying the social brain hypothesis and offer a starting point for mathematical treatments of social complexity.</description>

      <title>The European research elite: a cross-national study of highly productive academics in 11 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a rare scholarly theme of highly productive academics, statistically confirming their pivotal role in knowledge production across 11 systems studied. The upper 10 % of highly productive academics in 11 European countries studied (N=17,211) provide on average almost half of all academic knowledge production. In contrast to dominating bibliometric studies of research productivity, we focus on academic attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions as predictors of becoming research top performers across European systems. Our paper provides a (large-scale and cross-country) corroboration of the systematic inequality in knowledge production, for the first time argued for by Lotka and de Solla Price. We corroborate the deep academic inequality in science and explore this segment of the academic profession. The European research elite is a highly homogeneous group of academics whose high research performance is driven by structurally similar factors, mostly individual rather than institutional. Highly productive academics are similar from a cross-national perspective, and they substantially differ intra-nationally from their lower-performing colleagues.</description>

      <title>Beyond Group Means and Into the World of Individuals: A Distributional Spotlight for Experimental Effects on Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, experimental effects on humans are investigated at the group level. In this work, we present a distributional "spotlight" to investigate experimental effects at the individual level. Specifically, we estimate the effects on individuals through the changes in the probability distributions of their experimental data across conditions. We test this approach on Reaction Time (RT) data from 10 individuals in a visual search task, examining the effects of (1) information set sizes and (2) the presence or absence of a target on their processing speed. The changes in individuals' RT distributions are measured using three approaches: (i) direct measurements of distributional changes are compared against the changes captured by two established models of RT: (ii) the ex-Gaussian distribution and (iii) the Drift-Diffusion model. We find that direct measurement of distributional changes provides the clearest view of the effects on individuals and highlights the presence of two sub-groups based on the effects experienced: one that shows neither effect and the other showing only the target-presence effect. Moreover, the intra-individual changes across conditions (i.e., the experimental effects) appear much smaller than the intra-individual differences (i.e., the random effects). Generally, these results highlight the merits of going beyond group means and examining the effects on individuals, as well as the effectiveness of the distributional spotlight in such pursuits.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Systems Analysis of Trap Music Exposure and School Dropout Among Costa Rican Adolescents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a surge in the popularity of trap music among adolescents has prompted concerns about its potential influence on youth behavior and educational outcomes. In this study, we develop a novel compartmental model using a system of differential equations to explore the relationship between exposure to trap music and school dropout rates among Costa Rican adolescents aged 13 to 17. The model divides the population into distinct compartments representing susceptible individuals, casual listeners, active participants, those exhibiting risk-associated behaviors, and ultimately, school dropouts. Key parameters, including transmission via peer influence, progression rates between exposure stages, and recovery dynamics, capture the complex interplay between cultural diffusion and behavioral change. Analytical investigation of the basic reproductive number, $R_0$, and both trap-free and endemic equilibrium states provide insight into the conditions under which the influence of trap music proliferates. Numerical simulations, implemented in MATLAB, further illustrate how parameter variations, especially the potential for recovery, affect the system's dynamics. Our results suggest that although exposure to trap music is widespread, the progression to adverse behavioral outcomes leading to school dropout is highly sensitive to intervention strategies, offering valuable implications for educational policy and targeted preventive measures.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Limits Shape Language Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical regularities in human language have fascinated researchers for decades, suggesting deep underlying principles governing its evolution and information structuring for efficient communication. While Zipf's Law describes the frequency-rank distribution of words, deviations from this pattern-particularly for less frequent words-challenge the notion of an entirely optimized communication system. Here, we present a theoretical framework that integrates concepts from information theory, network science, and adjacent possible to explain these deviations. We propose that language evolves through optimization processes constrained by the finite cognitive capacities of humans. This results in a dual structure within language: while frequent words form an optimized, highly navigable core, less frequent words reside in a suboptimal regime, requiring more complex combinations to convey meaning. Our findings reveal that Zipf's exponents' deviation to larger values-from 1 to 2-marks a transition from an optimal to a suboptimal state, dictated by cognitive limits. This transition imposes a fundamental limit on communication efficiency, where cognitive constraints lead to a reliance on combinations of words rather than the creation of new vocabulary to express an open-ended conceptual space. A simple model based on the adjacent possible remarkably aligns with the empirical frequency-rank distribution of words in a language. These insights have significant implications for natural language processing and the design of artificial linguistic models, offering new perspectives on optimizing human and machine communication.</description>

      <title>Bounded-METANET: A new discrete-time second-order macroscopic traffic flow model for bounded speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic traffic flow models are essential for analysing traffic dynamics in highways and urban roads. While second-order models like METANET capture non-equilibrium traffic states, they often produce unrealistic speed predictions, such as negative values or speeds above the free-flow limit, which limits their reliability in traffic management. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Bounded-METANET, a new discrete-time second-order model that refines METANET's speed update equation by removing the convection term and adding a virtual density mechanism to reflect anticipation and merging effects. This ensures that speeds stay bounded between zero and the free-flow speed, simplifying calibration and boosting usability. Validated with SUMO simulations and real-world German highway data, Bounded-METANET accurately captures non-equilibrium flow and the capacity drop phenomenon, and outperforms METANET in estimating the fundamental diagram under congestion. It achieves lower RMSE for speed and density in noise-free simulation data and better flow estimation in real-world data, though METANET edges out in speed RMSE. Unlike METANET, which can produce erratic shockwave speeds and flow errors, Bounded-METANET delivers consistent, realistic predictions. This makes it a promising tool for traffic modelling and control in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the influence of Vocational Education and Training with text embedding and similarity-based networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the potential influence of Vocational Education and Training (VET) courses on creating job opportunities and nurturing work skills has been considered challenging due to the ambiguity in defining their complex relationships and connections with the local economy. Here, we quantify the potential influence of VET courses and explain it with future economy and specialization by constructing a network of more than 17,000 courses, jobs, and skills in Singapore's SkillsFuture data based on their text similarities captured by a text embedding technique, Sentence Transformer. We find that VET courses associated with Singapore's 4th Industrial Revolution economy demonstrate higher influence than those related to other future economies. The course influence varies greatly across different sectors, attributed to the level of specificity of the skills covered. Lastly, we show a notable concentration of VET supply in certain occupation sectors requiring general skills, underscoring a disproportionate distribution of education supply for the labor market.</description>

      <title>Dynamic structural resilience of international staple food trade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important to maintain the resilient international food trade network for food security. We have constructed the international trade networks of maize, rice, soybean, and wheat based on bilateral flows data between economies. Drawing on information theory, we have measured their dynamic resilience based on efficiency and redundancy during 1986 to 2022. We have also investigated the impact of economies and relationships on their resilience. Overall, we argue that rice and soybean trade networks deserve more attention while resilience in maize and wheat shows a steady upward trend. Meanwhile, our findings emphasize the importance of diversity of trade flows and partners for enhancing resilience. Currently, for example, excessively high monopolization of soybean trade may not be beneficial for its resilience. Also, we have found that major exporters and relationships between geographically bordering economies have greater impact on the resilience. Moreover, we have confirmed the existence of different network structures with the optimal resilience as relationships are removed cumulatively, which may be an informative guide for the international food trade.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations, decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.</description>

      <title>Why do Opinions and Actions Diverge? A Dynamic Framework to Explore the Impact of Subjective Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Socio-psychological studies have identified a common phenomenon where an individual's public actions do not necessarily coincide with their private opinions, yet most existing models fail to capture the dynamic interplay between these two aspects. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel agent-based modeling framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a decision-making mechanism. More precisely, our framework generalizes the classical Hegselmann-Krause model by combining it with a utility maximization problem. Preliminary results from our model demonstrate that the degree of opinion-action divergence within a population can be effectively controlled by adjusting two key parameters that reflect agents' personality traits, while the presence of social network amplifies the divergence. In addition, we study the social diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into the model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection of innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings in socio-psychological literature. The strong relevance of the results to real-world phenomena highlights our framework's potential for future applications in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors.</description>

      <title>Efficient parameter inference in networked dynamical systems via steady states: A surrogate objective function approach integrating mean-field and nonlinear least squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In networked dynamical systems, inferring governing parameters is crucial for predicting nodal dynamics, such as gene expression levels, species abundance, or population density. While many parameter estimation techniques rely on time-series data, particularly systems that converge over extreme time ranges, only noisy steady-state data is available, requiring a new approach to infer dynamical parameters from noisy observations of steady states. However, the traditional optimization process is computationally demanding, requiring repeated simulation of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a surrogate objective function that leverages decoupled equations to compute steady states, significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, by optimizing the surrogate objective function, we obtain steady states that more accurately approximate the ground truth than noisy observations and predict future equilibria when topology changes. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across ecological, gene regulatory, and epidemic networks. Our approach provides an efficient and effective way to estimate parameters from steady-state data and has the potential to improve predictions in networked dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining Directed Networks with Ergodic Sets Preserving Diffusive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ergodic sets, subsets of nodes of the networks that are dynamically disjoint from the rest of the network (i.e. that can never be reached or left following to the network dynamics). We connect their definition to purely structural considerations of the network and study some of their basic properties. We study numerically the presence of such structures in a number of synthetic network models and in classes of networks from a variety of real-world applications, and we use them to present a compression algorithm that preserve the random walk diffusive dynamics of the original network.</description>

      <title>Causal Links Between Anthropogenic Emissions and Air Pollution Dynamics in Delhi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution poses significant health and environmental challenges, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. Delhi-National Capital Region experiences air pollution episodes due to complex interactions between anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions. Understanding the causal drivers of key pollutants such as $PM_{2.5}$ and ground $O_3$ is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study investigates the causal links of anthropogenic emissions on $PM_{2.5}$ and $O_3$ concentrations using predictive modeling and causal inference techniques. Integrating high-resolution air quality data from Jan 2018 to Aug 2023 across 32 monitoring stations, we develop predictive regression models that incorporate meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity), pollutant concentrations ($NO_2, SO_2, CO$), and seasonal harmonic components to capture both diurnal and annual cycles. Here, we show that reductions in anthropogenic emissions lead to significant decreases in $PM_{2.5}$ levels, whereas their effect on $O_3$ remains marginal and statistically insignificant. To address spatial heterogeneity, we employ Gaussian Process modeling. Further, we use Granger causality analysis and counterfactual simulation to establish direct causal links. Validation using real-world data from the COVID-19 lockdown confirms that reduced emissions led to a substantial drop in $PM_{2.5}$ but only a slight, insignificant change in $O_3$. The findings highlight the necessity of targeted emission reduction policies while emphasizing the need for integrated strategies addressing both particulate and ozone pollution. These insights are crucial for policymakers designing air pollution interventions in other megacities, and offer a scalable methodology for tackling complex urban air pollution through data-driven decision-making.</description>

      <title>Expertise diversity of teams predicts originality and long-term impact in science and technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the growing importance of teams in producing innovative and high-impact science and technology, it remains unclear how expertise diversity among team members relates to the originality and impact of the work they produce. Here, we develop a new method to quantify the expertise distance of researchers based on their prior career histories and apply it to 23 million scientific publications and 4 million patents. We find that across science and technology, expertise-diverse teams tend to produce work with greater originality. Teams with more diverse expertise have no significant impact advantage in the short- (2 years) or mid-term (5 years). Instead, they exhibit substantially higher long-term impact (10 years), increasingly attracting larger cross-disciplinary influence. This impact premium of expertise diversity among team members becomes especially pronounced when other dimensions of team diversity are missing, as teams within the same institution or country appear to disproportionately reap the benefits of expertise diversity. While gender-diverse teams have relatively higher impact on average, teams with varied levels of gender diversity all seem to benefit from increased expertise diversity. Given the growing knowledge demands on individual researchers, implementation of incentives for original research, and the tradeoffs between short-term and long-term impacts, these results may have implications for funding, assembling, and retaining teams with originality and long-lasting impacts.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition of k-frequent destinations network for urban mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban spatial interactions are a complex aggregation of routine visits and random explorations by individuals. The inherent uncertainty of these random visitations poses significant challenges to understanding urban structures and socioeconomic developments. To capture the core dynamics of urban interaction networks, we analyze the percolation structure of the $k$-most frequented destinations of intracity place-to-place flows from mobile phone data of eight major U.S. cities at a Census Block Group (CBG) level. Our study reveals a consistent percolation transition at $k^* = 130$, a critical threshold for the number of frequently visited destinations necessary to maintain a cohesive urban network. This percolation threshold proves remarkably consistent across diverse urban configurations, sizes, and geographical settings over a 48-month study period, and can largely be interpreted as the joint effect of the emergence of hubness and the level of mixing of residents. Furthermore, we examine the socioeconomic profiles of residents from different origin areas categorized by the fulfillment level of $k^*=130$ principal destinations, revealing a pronounced distinction in the origins' socioeconomic advantages. These insights offer a nuanced understanding of how urban spaces are interconnected and the determinants of travel behavior. Our findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the structural dynamics that govern urban spatial interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal emergence of local Zipf's law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plethora of natural and socio-economic phenomena share a striking statistical regularity, that is the magnitude of elements decreases with a power law as a function of their position in a ranking of magnitude. Such regularity is known as Zipf-Mandelbrot law (ZM), and plenty of problem-specific explanations for its emergence have been provided in different fields. Yet, an explanation for ZM ubiquity is currently lacking. In this paper we first provide an analytical expression for the cumulants of any ranked sample of i.i.d. random variables once sorted in decreasing order. Then we make use of this result to rigorously demonstrate that, whenever a small fraction of such ranked dataset is considered, it becomes statistically indistinguishable from a ZM law. We finally validate our results against several relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Modelling Singularities in Macroevolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroevolutionary dynamics often display sudden, explosive surges, where systems remain relatively stable for extended periods before experiencing dramatic acceleration that frequently exceeds traditional exponential growth. This pattern is evident in biological evolution, cultural shifts, and technological progress and is often referred to as the emergence of singularities. Despite their widespread occurrence, these explosions arise from distinct underlying mechanisms in different domains. In this context, we present a unified framework that captures these dynamics through a theory of combinatorial innovation. Building on the Theory of the Adjacent Possible, we model macroevolutionary change as a process driven by recombining pre-existing elements within a system. By formalising these qualitative insights, we provide a mathematical structure that explains the emergence of these explosive phenomena, facilitates comparisons across different systems, and enables predictive insights into future evolutionary trajectories. Moreover, by comparing discrete and continuous formalisations of the theory, we emphasise that the occurrence and observation of these presumed singularities should be carefully considered, as they arise from the continuous limit of inherently discrete models.</description>

      <title>Beautimeter: Harnessing GPT for Assessing Architectural and Urban Beauty based on the 15 Properties of Living Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beautimeter is a new tool powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology, designed to evaluate architectural and urban beauty. Rooted in Christopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that all environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life. Alexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and thick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as a basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure embodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural and urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights into the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of case studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as well as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate Beautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse contexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter offers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create spaces that resonate deeply with people. This paper also explores the implications of such technology for architecture and urban design, highlighting its potential to enhance both the design process and the assessment of built environments.

      <title>Open Models, Closed Minds? On Agents Capabilities in Mimicking Human Personalities through Open Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of unveiling human-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a closer connection between NLP and human psychology. Scholars have been studying the inherent personalities exhibited by LLMs and attempting to incorporate human traits and behaviors into them. However, these efforts have primarily focused on commercially-licensed LLMs, neglecting the widespread use and notable advancements seen in Open LLMs. This work aims to address this gap by employing a set of 12 LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models and subject them to a series of assessments concerning the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) test. Our approach involves evaluating the intrinsic personality traits of Open LLM agents and determining the extent to which these agents can mimic human personalities when conditioned by specific personalities and roles. Our findings unveil that $(i)$ each Open LLM agent showcases distinct human personalities; $(ii)$ personality-conditioned prompting produces varying effects on the agents, with only few successfully mirroring the imposed personality, while most of them being ``closed-minded'' (i.e., they retain their intrinsic traits); and $(iii)$ combining role and personality conditioning can enhance the agents' ability to mimic human personalities. Our work represents a step up in understanding the dense relationship between NLP and human psychology through the lens of Open LLMs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the inference of ratings and rankings in complex networks using discrete exterior calculus on higher--order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference of rankings plays a central role in the theory of social choice, which seeks to establish preferences from collectively generated data, such as pairwise comparisons. Examples include political elections, ranking athletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines using hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based on user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from incomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang {\em et al.}~[Math. Program. {\bf 127}, 203 (2011)], utilizes Hodge decomposition of cochains in higher--order networks to disentangle gradient and cyclical components contributing to rating scores, enabling a parsimonious inference of ratings and rankings for lists of items. This paper presents a systematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched disorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four different network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of perfect retrieval of true rankings to one of imperfect retrieval as the strength of the quenched disorder increases. A range of observables are analyzed, and their scaling behavior with respect to the network model parameters is characterized. This work advances the understanding of social choice theory and the inference of ratings and rankings within complex network structures.</description>

      <title>Who is the root in a syntactic dependency structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The syntactic structure of a sentence can be described as a tree that indicates the syntactic relationships between words. In spite of significant progress in unsupervised methods that retrieve the syntactic structure of sentences, guessing the right direction of edges is still a challenge. As in a syntactic dependency structure edges are oriented away from the root, the challenge of guessing the right direction can be reduced to finding an undirected tree and the root. The limited performance of current unsupervised methods demonstrates the lack of a proper understanding of what a root vertex is from first principles. We consider an ensemble of centrality scores, some that only take into account the free tree (non-spatial scores) and others that take into account the position of vertices (spatial scores). We test the hypothesis that the root vertex is an important or central vertex of the syntactic dependency structure. We confirm that hypothesis and find that the best performance in guessing the root is achieved by novel scores that only take into account the position of a vertex and that of its neighbours. We provide theoretical and empirical foundations towards a universal notion of rootness from a network science perspective.</description>
