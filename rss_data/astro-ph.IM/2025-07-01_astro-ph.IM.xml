      <title>Bahamas: BAyesian inference with HAmiltonian Montecarlo for Astrophysical Stochastic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LISA datastream will be populated by large instrumental and astrophysical noises, both potentially exhibiting long-term non-stationarities. Modelling and inferring on them is a challenging task, central for accurate signal reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{bahamas}$, a codebase designed to characterize noises and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) in LISA. $\texttt{bahamas}$ adopts a time-frequency data representation, based on the Short Time Fourier Transform, to accurately describe the signal temporal evolution and accommodate for the presence of data gaps. In addition, $\texttt{bahamas}$ supports a variety of SGWB spectral models proposed in literature, enabling joint inference on them. Posterior sampling leverages No-U-Turn sampling an efficient variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, inheriting the cross-hardware capabilities provided by NumPyro (CPU/GPU/TPU). We benchmark $\texttt{bahamas}$ performances on a simple test case, and present ongoing developments to appear in future releases.</description>

      <title>On beam characterization of ground-based CMB radio telescopes using UAV-mounted sources: application to the QUIJOTE TFGI and plans for LSPE-Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Scale Polarization Explorer (LSPE) project, funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), includes the development of LSPE-Strip, a ground-based radio telescope for observing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. LSPE-Strip, nearing its construction phase, will operate from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, employing 49 coherent polarimeters at 43 GHz to deliver critical data on CMB anisotropies and 6 channels at 95 GHz as atmospheric monitor. On-site characterization of such advanced instruments is crucial to detect possible systematic effects, such as gain fluctuations, beam distortions, and pointing errors, that can compromise performance by introducing spurious polarizations or radiation collection from unintended directions. To address these challenges, a drone-mounted Q-band test source for on-site characterization of LSPE-Strip's polarimeter array was developed. Modern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible approach for antenna pattern measurements, yet their use in high-frequency radio astronomy is not consolidated practice. In October 2022, a UAV-based measurement campaign was conducted with the TFGI instrument on the second QUIJOTE telescope in Tenerife, in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. This pioneering effort aimed to validate UAV-based beam characterization methods and assess QUIJOTE's performance under operational conditions. Preliminary results demonstrated high measurement accuracy, leveraging QUIJOTE's dual-receiver configuration for beam validation. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing UAV systems in preparation for LSPE-Strip's future characterization.</description>

      <title>Variability-finding in Rubin Data Preview 1 with LSDB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1) in advance of the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will enable boundless discoveries in time-domain astronomy over the next ten years. DP1 provides an ideal sandbox for validating innovative data analysis approaches for the LSST mission, whose scale challenges established software infrastructure paradigms. This note presents a pair of such pipelines for variability-finding using powerful software infrastructure suited to LSST data, namely the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and the LSDB framework, developed by the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. This note presents a pair of variability-finding pipelines built on LSDB, the HATS catalog of DP1 data, and preliminary results of detected variable objects, two of which are novel discoveries.</description>

      <title>High-precision polarization measurements with Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to demonstrate that two arrays of Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs), when employed in filled array configuration and separated by an external linear polarizer oriented at 45 degrees, can achieve the precision required by next-generation cosmological experiments. The focus here is on validating their ability to meet stringent uncertainty requirements, in particular for polarization angle reconstruction. To achieve this, the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the polarization angle have been characterized in the laboratory using a dedicated closed-circuit 100 mK dilution cryostat. This is optically coupled to a Martin-Puplett interferometer and a custom-designed sky simulator equipped with both photometric and polarized sources, allowing one to reproduce realistic ground-based observation conditions. This experimental setup allows us to generate intensity and polarization maps with diffraction-limited resolution, allowing us to determine the polarization angles and their associated uncertainties. The results show performance in line with expectations for the next generation CMB experiments. The polarization angle was reconstructed with an uncertainty of 6.5 arcmin.</description>

      <title>Studying Protoplanets and Protoplanetary Disks with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star, the confirmation of nearly 6000 exoplanets to date - and their diversity - has revolutionized our knowledge of planetary systems in the past three decades. Nevertheless, the majority of these planets are around mature stars (${\gtrsim}1$ Gyr), where the planet birth environments have already dissipated. Indeed, we have only confirmed 2 forming planets (i.e., protoplanets; ${\lesssim}10$ Myr) residing in one single system. In comparison, we have imaged over 200 protoplanetary disks in the past decade, with many of them hosting substructures such as spirals and gaps which suggest the existence of protoplanets. To understand the early stages of planet formation, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - with its high-contrast imaging and integral field spectroscopy capabilities - presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of the natal stages of planet formation and their birth environments. We propose to image protoplanets within substructured protoplanetary disks using HWO via direct imaging, and characterize them (i.e., protoplanets, protoplanetary disks, circumplanetary disks) using integral field spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry. This effort will dramatically extend current population of protoplanets, probing and characterizing over 200 protoplanets. By expanding the number of protoplanets by two orders of magnitude, these observations will test and refine planet formation theory and planet-disk interaction theory, and further motivate planet migration studies together with existing mature planets. The results will offer critical insight into planetary system formation and evolution, and help understand the origin of our own Solar System.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Dynamics and Chemistry of Transiting Exoplanets with the Habitable World Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary scientific objective of this Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Science Case Development Document (SCDD) is to measure planetary rotation rates of transiting exoplanets to determine the structure, composition, circulation, and aerosol properties of their planetary atmospheres. For this analysis, HWO would obtain spectroscopic phase curves for planets with orbital periods of 5 - 20+ days, to assess tidal locking radius assumptions. Extending phase curve studies out to longer orbital periods than accessible with current and near-future telescopes will enable detailed investigation of atmospheric structure, composition, and circulation for planets that are much cooler than the more highly irradiated planets accessible with JWST phase curve observations (i.e., Teq &lt; 500 K for HWO versus 1400 K &lt;= Teq &lt;= 2600 K for JWST). Broad wavelength coverage extending from the UV to the NIR would capture both reflected light and thermal emission, enabling HWO to conduct comprehensive characterization of planetary atmospheres. UV observations would probe high altitudes, thereby providing valuable insights into atmospheric (dis)equilibrium, aerosol properties, and the effects of photochemical processes on atmospheric composition. We also discuss the role of polarimetry in the classification of aerosols and the associated role they play in the atmospheric energy budget that directly ties them to the chemistry and circulation structure of the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>How Do Ionizing Photons Escape from Star-Forming Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1-100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. A UV integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph capable of resolving galaxies across these scales is necessary--and uniquely achievable with the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory. In this article, we outline the scientific motivation, observables, and observational capabilities needed to make progress on these fundamental questions.</description>

      <title>A systematic bias in template-based RV extraction algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we identify and explore a previously unidentified, multi meter-per-second, systematic correlation between time and RVs inferred through TM and LBL methods. We evaluate the influence of the data-driven stellar template in the RV bias and hypothesize on the possible sources of this effect. We first use the s-BART pipeline to extract RVs from three different datasets gathered over four nights of ESPRESSO and HARPS observations. Then, we demonstrate that the effect can be recovered on a larger sample of 19 targets, totaling 4124 ESPRESSO observations spread throughout 38 nights. We also showcase the presence of the bias in RVs extracted with the SERVAL and ARVE pipelines. Lastly, we explore the construction of the stellar template through the 5 years of ESPRESSO observations of HD10700, totalling more than 2000 observations. We find that a systematic quasi-linear bias affects the RV extraction with slopes that vary from -0.3 m/s-1/h-1 to -52 m/s-1/h-1 in our sample. This trend is not observed in CCF RVs and appears when all observations of a given star are collected within a short time-period (timescales of hours). We show that this systematic contamination exists in the RV time-series of two different template-matching pipelines, one line-by-line pipeline, and that it is agnostic to the spectrograph. We also find that this effect is connected with the construction of the stellar template, as we are able to mitigate it through a careful selection of the observations used to construct it. Our results suggest that a contamination of micro-telluric features, coupled other sources of correlated noise, could be the driving factor of this effect. We also show that this effect does not impact the usual usage of template-matching for the detection and characterization of exoplanets. Other short-timescale science cases can however be severely affected.</description>

      <title>From new physics to a running power law and back again: Minimal refitting techniques for the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave background signal in pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently presented evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies. In this paper, we introduce new refitting techniques for PTA data analysis that elevate related techniques in the literature to a more rigorous level and thus provide the basis for fast and accurate Bayesian inference and physically intuitive model comparisons. The key idea behind our approach is to construct maps \Phi from GWB spectral models to a running-power-law (RPL) reference model, such that the pullback \Phi^* P_RPL of the RPL posterior density P_RPL induces a likelihood on the GWB model parameter space; in other words, we refit spectral models to the RPL posterior density. In order to construct \Phi, we introduce a matched-filtering approach in which \Phi follows from a \chi^2 minimization that accounts for the frequency dependence of PTA sensitivity curves. We validate and illustrate our techniques by three concrete examples: GWs from stable cosmic strings, GWs from metastable strings, and scalar-induced GWs.</description>

      <title>Searching for quasinormal modes from Binary Black Hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Model Framework for Reconstructing Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) holds immense value for its application in cosmological research because it provides more precise measurements of the parameter of interest of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation which is a relation among the end time of the plateau emission, Ta, its respective luminosity, La which is calculated from the fluxes at the end of the plateau, Fa. This study extends the work done by arXiv:2305.12126; arXiv:2412.20091v4 on the 545 GRB sample by introducing six different models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid model of Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting and Isotonic Regression. Our findings demonstrate that Isotonic Regression achieves the highest uncertainty reduction for all three parameters (36.3% for log Ta, 36.1% for log Fa, and 43.6% for {\alpha}) outperforming all the other models. The CNN- LSTM model shows consistent improvements across all GRB parameters with the lowest outlier rate for {\alpha} (0.550%), surpassing the performance of the LSTM model in arXiv:2412.20091v4. The DGP model offers reliable uncertainty reduction across all parameters and improves upon the single-layer GP baseline. These advancements are essential for using GRBs as theoretical model discriminators via the parameters of their LCs and standard candles in cosmology, investigating theoretical models, and predicting GRB redshifts through recent cutting-edge machine-learning analysis (arXiv:2411.10736,arXiv:2405.02263; arXiv:2410.13985).</description>

      <title>Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step towards their application to superconducting electronics and quantum technologies. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</description>

      <title>A planet-host ratio relation to synthesize microlensing and transiting exoplanet demography from Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: ~1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and ~200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass-radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet-host ratio relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet-host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly under-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star &gt; 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>Initial Results From the First Field Expedition of UAPx to Study Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In July 2021, faculty from the UAlbany Department of Physics participated in a week-long field expedition with the organization UAPx to collect data on UAPs in Avalon, California, located on Catalina Island, and nearby. This paper reviews both the hardware and software techniques which this collaboration employed, and contains a frank discussion of the successes and failures, with a section about how to apply lessons learned to future expeditions. Both observable-light and infrared cameras were deployed, as well as sensors for other (non-EM) emissions. A pixel-subtraction method was augmented with other similarly simple methods to provide initial identification of objects in the sky and/or the sea crossing the cameras' fields of view. The first results will be presented based upon approximately one hour in total of triggered visible/night-vision-mode video and over 600 hours of un-triggered (far) IR video recorded, as well as 55 hours of (background) radiation measurements. Following multiple explanatory resolutions of several ambiguities that were potentially anomalous at first, we focus on the primary remaining ambiguity captured at approximately 4am Pacific Time on Friday, July 16: a dark spot in the visible/near-IR camera possibly coincident with ionizing radiation that has so far resisted prosaic explanation. We conclude with quantitative suggestions (3-5 sigma rules) for serious researchers in the still-maligned field of hard-science-based UAP studies, with an ultimate goal of identifying UAPs without confirmation bias toward mundane / speculative conclusions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Scheme for Fuzzy Dark Matter Simulations Combining the Schr\"odinger and Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid numerical scheme for the fuzzy dark matter model: It combines a wave-based approach to solve the Schr\"odinger equation using Fourier continuations with Gram polynomials and a fluid-based approach to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations. This hybrid scheme facilitates zoom-in simulations for cosmological volumes beyond the capabilities of wave-based solvers alone and accurately simulates the full nonlinear dynamics of fuzzy dark matter. We detail the implementation of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung solver, the methodology for phase matching at fluid-wave boundaries, the development of a local pseudospectral wave solver based on Fourier continuations, new grid refinement criteria for both fluid and wave solvers, an interpolation algorithm based on Fourier continuations, and the integration of these building blocks into the adaptive mesh refinement code GAMER. The superiority of the scheme is demonstrated through various performance and accuracy tests, tracking the linear power spectrum evolution in a 10 Mpc/h box, and a hybrid cosmological simulation in a 5.6 Mpc/h box. The corresponding code is published as part of the GAMER project on https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer.</description>

      <title>Using t-SNE for characterizing glitches in LIGO detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glitches are non-Gaussian noise transients originating from environmental and instrumental sources that contaminate data from gravitational wave detectors. Some glitches can even mimic gravitational wave signals from compact object mergers, which are the primary targets of terrestrial observatories. In this study, we present a method to analyze noise transients from the LIGO observatories using Q-transform information combined with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We implement classification techniques, examine the influence of parameters on glitch classification, and conduct a week-long daily analysis to track outlier transients over time.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach to calculate the anharmonic infrared (IR) absorption spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), key carriers of interstellar aromatic IR bands. This method accounts for temperature effects in a molecule-specific way and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional quantum chemical calculations at a fraction of the cost, scaling linearly with system size. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms at different temperatures, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical Bayesian approach to point source analysis in high-energy neutrino telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to the detection of point-like sources of high-energy neutrinos. Motivated by evidence for emerging sources in existing data, we focus on the characterization and interpretation of these sources rather than the rejection of the background-only hypothesis. The hierarchical Bayesian model is implemented in the Stan platform, enabling computation of the posterior distribution with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. We simulate a population of weak neutrino sources detected by the IceCube experiment and use the resulting data set to demonstrate and validate our framework. We show that even for the challenging case of sources at the threshold of detection and using limited prior information, it is possible to correctly infer the source properties. Additionally, we demonstrate how modeling flexible connections between similar sources can be used to recover the contribution of sources that would not be detectable individually. While a direct comparison of our method to existing approaches is challenged by the fundamental differences in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, we draw parallels where possible. In particular, we highlight how including more complexity into the source modeling can increase the sensitivity to sources and their populations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of spinning black holes in modified gravity through METRICS: The dynamical Chern-Simons gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first precise calculations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode (QNM) frequencies for spinning black holes with dimensionless angular momenta $J/M^2 := a \lesssim 0.75$ in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. Using the \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS) framework, we compute the QNM frequencies of both axial and polar metric perturbations, focusing on the $nl m = 022$, $033$, and $032$ modes. The METRICS frequencies for the 022 mode achieve numerical uncertainties $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ when $0 \leq a \leq 0.5$ and $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for $0.5 \leq a \leq 0.75$, without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations. We also derive optimal fitting polynomials to enable efficient and accurate evaluations of the leading-order frequency shifts in these modes. The METRICS frequencies and fitting expressions are a robust and indispensable step toward enabling gravitational-wave ringdown tests of dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.</description>
