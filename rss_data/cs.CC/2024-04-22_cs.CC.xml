      <title>Unambiguous and Co-Nondeterministic Computations of Finite Automata and Pushdown Automata Families and the Effects of Multiple Counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonuniform families of polynomial-size finite automata and pushdown automata respectively have strong connections to nonuniform-NL and nonuniform-LOGCFL. We examine the behaviors of unambiguous and co-nondeterministic computations produced by such families of automata operating multiple counters. As its consequences, we obtain various collapses of the complexity classes of families of promise problems solvable by finite and pushdown automata families when all valid instances are limited to either polynomially long strings or unary strings. A key technical ingredient of our proofs is an inductive counting of reachable vertices of each computation graph of finite and pushdown automata that operate multiple counters simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Prove Symbolic Regression is NP-hard by Symbol Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) is the task of discovering a symbolic expression that fits a given data set from the space of mathematical expressions. Despite the abundance of research surrounding the SR problem, there's a scarcity of works that confirm its NP-hard nature. Therefore, this paper introduces the concept of a symbol graph as a comprehensive representation of the entire mathematical expression space, effectively illustrating the NP-hard characteristics of the SR problem. Leveraging the symbol graph, we establish a connection between the SR problem and the task of identifying an optimally fitted degree-constrained Steiner Arborescence (DCSAP). The complexity of DCSAP, which is proven to be NP-hard, directly implies the NP-hard nature of the SR problem.</description>

      <title>Functional Closure Properties of Finite $\mathbb{N}$-weighted Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine all functional closure properties of finite $\mathbb{N}$-weighted automata, even all multivariate ones, and in particular all multivariate polynomials. We also determine all univariate closure properties in the promise setting, and all multivariate closure properties under certain assumptions on the promise, in particular we determine all multivariate closure properties where the output vector lies on a monotone algebraic graph variety.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage and CSP Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information-processing tasks modelled by homomorphisms between relational structures can witness quantum advantage when entanglement is used as a computational resource. We prove that the occurrence of quantum advantage is determined by the same type of algebraic structure (known as a minion) that captures the polymorphism identities of CSPs and, thus, CSP complexity. We investigate the connection between the minion of quantum advantage and other known minions controlling CSP tractability and width. In this way, we make use of complexity results from the algebraic theory of CSPs to characterise the occurrence of quantum advantage in the case of graphs, and to obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions in the case of arbitrary relational structures.</description>

      <title>On the Length of Strongly Monotone Descending Chains over $\mathbb{N}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent breakthrough by K\"unnemann, Mazowiecki, Sch\"utze, Sinclair-Banks, and Wegrzycki (ICALP, 2023) bounds the running time for the coverability problem in $d$-dimensional vector addition systems under unary encoding to $n^{2^{O(d)}}$, improving on Rackoff's $n^{2^{O(d\lg d)}}$ upper bound (Theor. Comput. Sci., 1978), and provides conditional matching lower bounds.
  In this paper, we revisit Lazi\'c and Schmitz' "ideal view" of the backward coverability algorithm (Inform. Comput., 2021) in the light of this breakthrough. We show that the controlled strongly monotone descending chains of downwards-closed sets over $\mathbb{N}^d$ that arise from the dual backward coverability algorithm of Lazi\'c and Schmitz on $d$-dimensional unary vector addition systems also enjoy this tight $n^{2^{O(d)}}$ upper bound on their length, and that this also translates into the same bound on the running time of the backward coverability algorithm.
  Furthermore, our analysis takes place in a more general setting than that of Lazi\'c and Schmitz, which allows to show the same results and improve on the 2EXPSPACE upper bound derived by Benedikt, Duff, Sharad, and Worrell (LICS, 2017) for the coverability problem in invertible affine nets.</description>

      <title>Discrete Nonparametric Causal Discovery Under Latent Class Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An acyclic causal structure can be described using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with arrows indicating causation. The task of learning these structures from data is known as ``causal discovery''. Diverse populations or changing environments can sometimes give rise to heterogeneous data. This heterogeneity can be thought of as a mixture model with multiple ``sources'', each exerting their own distinct signature on the observed variables. From this perspective, the source is a latent common cause for every observed variable. While some methods for causal discovery are able to work around unobserved confounding in special cases, the only known ways to deal with a global confounder (such as a latent class) involve parametric assumptions. These assumptions are restrictive, especially for discrete variables. By focusing on discrete observables, we demonstrate that globally confounded causal structures can still be identifiable without parametric assumptions, so long as the number of latent classes remains small relative to the size and sparsity of the underlying DAG.</description>

      <title>A Note on Output Length of One-Way State Generators and EFIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the output length of one-way state generators (OWSGs), their weaker variants, and EFIs.
  - Standard OWSGs. Recently, Cavalar et al. (arXiv:2312.08363) give OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(\log \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, and conjecture that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. We prove their conjecture in a stronger manner by showing that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. This means that their construction is optimal in terms of output length.
  - Inverse-polynomial-advantage OWSGs. Let $\epsilon$-OWSGs be a parameterized variant of OWSGs where a quantum polynomial-time adversary's advantage is at most $\epsilon$. For any constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$, we construct $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with $((c+1)\log \lambda+O(1))$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with at most $(c\log \lambda-2)$-qubit outputs.
  - Constant-advantage OWSGs. For any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct $\epsilon$-OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of subexponentially secure OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $O(1)$-OWSGs with $((\log \log \lambda)/2+O(1))$-qubit outputs.
  - Weak OWSGs. We refer to $(1-1/\mathsf{poly}(\lambda))$-OWSGs as weak OWSGs. We construct weak OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(1)$ assuming the existence of exponentially secure OWFs with linear expansion. We show that this is tight by proving that there do not exist weak OWSGs with $O(1)$-qubit outputs.
  - EFIs. We show that there do not exist $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs. We show that this is tight by proving that there exist $\omega(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs assuming the existence of exponentially secure PRGs.</description>
