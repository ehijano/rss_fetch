      <title>The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES). II. Machine Learning-Based Stellar parameters for 21 million stars from the First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar parameters for large samples of stars play a crucial role in constraining the nature of stars and stellar populations in the Galaxy. An increasing number of medium-band photometric surveys are presently used in estimating stellar parameters. In this study, we present a machine-learning approach to derive estimates of stellar parameters, including [Fe/H], logg, and Teff, based on a combination of medium-band and broad-band photometric observations. Our analysis employs data primarily sourced from the SAGE Survey , which aims to observe much of the Northern Hemisphere. We combine the $uv$-band data from SAGES DR1 with photometric and astrometric data from Gaia EDR3, and apply the random forest method to estimate stellar parameters for approximately 21 million stars. We are able to obtain precisions of 0.09 dex for [Fe/H], 0.12 dex for logg, and 70 K for Teff. Furthermore, by incorporating 2MASS and WISE infrared photometric and GALEX ultraviolet data, we are able to achieve even higher precision estimates for over 2.2 million stars. These results are applicable to both giant and dwarf stars. Building upon this mapping, we construct a foundational dataset for research on metal-poor stars, the structure of the Milky Way, and beyond. With the forthcoming release of additional bands from SAGE Survey such DDO51 and H-alpha, this versatile machine learning approach is poised to play an important role in upcoming surveys featuring expanded filter sets</description>

      <title>Measuring the Sun's Core with Neutrino Measurements: A Solar Orbiter Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional neutrino detectors are built deep underground to reduce backgrounds. The neutrino solar orbiting laboratory ($\nu$SOL) collaboration has been developing a concept to improve neutrino measurement not with a larger detector underground, but instead we use the nuclear excitation from the neutrino interaction to produce a multi-pulse signal. Cerium-doped gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (GAGG) is a new scintillator which has 23\% gallium by mass. When a neutrino interacts with the GAGG, about 10\% of the time it will be in an excited nuclear state rather than in the base energy level. A segmented detector looking for the pulses separated by distance and time has the potential to greatly limit background noise from solar wind, cosmic rays, and galactic gamma rays. A polar LEO CubeSat mission is currently in development to measure the GCR backgrounds outside the Van Allen Belts.
  In this summary of my presentation I will quickly lay the groundwork of the interaction of interest and what a solar orbiter's detector could look like. I will then explore what measurements a near-solar orbiter could make. With these measurements in mind, I will discuss the feasibility of a direct observation of the core's shape, and I will discuss how a solar orbiter's measurements could improve a Standard Solar Model search and compare that measurement with the current global neutrino measurements. I will conclude with a discussion of what these observables could tell us about the solar interior.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Multi-band Absolute Magnitudes and Color Indexes of the Tip of Red Giant Branch Stars on Metallicity in the Galactic Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tip of red giant branch (TRGB) stars have attracted intensive attention in recent years because their $I$-band absolute magnitudes, $M_\rm I$, are often used for distance calibration in the Hubble constant measurements because of its almost independence on metallicity ([Fe/H]). However, a discrepancy exists between various studies and the theoretical stellar model predicts dependence of their luminosity on [Fe/H]. Here we present a careful study of the dependence of absolute magnitudes and color indexes on metallicity in optical and near-infrared bands. With the TRGB stars identified in 33 Galactic globular clusters by the reddest color in the $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ vs. $G_{\rm RP}$ diagram, it is confirmed that $M_\rm I$ is almost constant of $-4.017 \pm 0.036 \pm 0.027$ mag when $[\rm Fe/H]&lt;-1.2$, which would give $H_0=70.86\pm 1.2\pm0.9$ $\rm kms^{-1} Mp c^{-1}$ with this updated luminosity calibration for type Ia supernovae. However, for $[\rm Fe/H]&gt;-1.2$, $M_\rm I$ is found to become fainter with lower metallicity, which would lead to a larger Hubble constant. In the optical $G_{\rm BP}, G_{\rm RP}$ and $V$ bands, the absolute magnitude of TRGB stars tends to increase with metallicity, while in the infrared $J, H$, and $K_{\rm S}$ bands, the variation with metallicity shows an inverse tendency. In addition, the analytical relations of the color indexes with metallicity are presented, which have smaller dispersion than those derived for the corresponding absolute magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Newly Catalogued Open Star Cluster UPK~220 with Gaia DR3 and TESS: Discovering Member Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on star clusters with the same age and initial chemical composition have gained momentum in recent years with the use of \textit{Gaia}. In addition, the discovery of new clusters with Gaia has increased the number of open clusters to be examined. Many of these discovered sources are intermediate-age open clusters and have not been analyzed in detail yet. In this study, we focused on newly cataloged open cluster UPK~220. The fundamental parameters (distance, age, metallicity and reddening) of UPK~220 were determined by analysing the variable stars within the cluster, while simultaneously constraining the parameters of the variable stars using these cluster parameters. To achieve this, we combined GaiaDR3 and TESS photometric observations. Using GaiaDR3, we derive fundamental parameters of UPK~220 through membership analyses, and with TESS, we discovered eight member variable stars. We also extracted the atmospheric parameters ($logg$, $[Fe/H]$ and $T_{\rm eff}$) for the variable stars using SED, GSP-Phot and GSP-Spec, and MESA models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting symbiotic binaries with interferometry. I. The PIONIER archival collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars serve as exceptional laboratories for investigating mass transfer processes in binary systems. However, the dominant mechanism of mass transfer from the red giant donor to the compact accretor - typically a white dwarf or, in rare cases, a neutron star - remains unclear. It is uncertain whether it is driven primarily by the stellar wind, Roche-lobe overflow, or a combination of the two. While radii inferred from rotational velocities or spectral types suggest smaller Roche-lobe filling factors, the presence of ellipsoidal variability, presumably caused by tidally deformed giants in many symbiotic systems, indicates the opposite. Interferometric observations of symbiotic giants, combined with distance measurements provided by the Gaia mission, offer a promising avenue to resolve this discrepancy. In this first paper of the series, we (re)analyze VLTI/PIONIER observations of six symbiotic stars: AG Peg, FG Ser, ER Del, V1261 Ori, RW Hya, and V399 Pav. With the exception of the uncertain case of V399 Pav, we find that the giants in these systems remain well within their canonical Roche lobes, even in V1261 Ori and RW Hya, where ellipsoidal variability is observed. All six stars appear to be rather luminous and likely located on the asymptotic giant branch, although the possibility of some of them being at the tip of the first red giant branch cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous existence of the ocsillations, counterstreaming flows and mass injections in solar quiescent prominences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar prominences are very spectacular structures embedded in the tenuous and hot solar corona. The counterstreaming flows, a common feature in solar quiescent prominences, have been discovered for more than twenty years. However, the mechanism driving the counterstreaming flows is still elusive. To unveil the nature of this phenomenon, we analyzed the data of a quiescent prominence observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). It is found that there is a distinct longitudinal oscillation of prominence plasma along the higher part of the prominence spine in H$\alpha$ observations. The oscillation period is approximately 83 minutes and the amplitude is about 32 Mm. The counterstreaming flows are dominant in the middle part of the prominence spine. The velocities of the counterstreaming flows range from about 4 km s$^{-1}$ to 11 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, the intermittent mass flows with the upward plumes from the top of the bubbles and tornado-like barbs are observed to be injected into the lower part of the prominence spine from the lower atmosphere. The velocities of these injected mass flows range from about 3 km s$^{-1}$ to 30 km s$^{-1}$. Some injected mass flows exhibit redshifted Doppler signals, while others exhibit blueshifted signals. Based on these high resolution observations, it is found that different parts of the prominence spine exhibit the different dynamic characteristics. These results further advance the understanding of the ubiquitous counterstreaming flows in solar quiescent prominences.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Peculiar Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales is a fundamental driver of energy release and plasma dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere. We present novel observations of a brightening in an active region, captured in high-resolution data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) using the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). The event exhibits Ellerman bomb-like morphology in the H$\beta$ filter, associated with flux cancellation between a small negative polarity patch adjacent to opposite-polarity plage. Additionally, it displays a distinct annular emission pattern in Ca II K, hot jet-like structures containing Alfv\'enic plasma flows, and cooler surges. We employ multi-line, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions of the spectropolarimetric data to infer the stratification of the physical parameters of the atmosphere. Furthermore, we use the photospheric vector magnetogram inferred from the ViSP spectra as a boundary condition for nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, revealing the three-dimensional distribution of squashing factors. We find significant enhancements in temperature, velocity, and microturbulence confined to the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. Our findings provide observational evidence of low-altitude magnetic reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers in a compact fan-spine-type configuration, highlighting the complex interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma flows. Finally, we discuss the potential role of nonthermal particles in the distinct emissions at different wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of gravitational wave source populations and their progenitors is an endeavor more than eighty years in the making. This is in part due to a wide variety of theoretical uncertainties that must be taken into account when describing how stellar populations evolve over cosmic time to produce double stellar remnant binaries. Population synthesis software has been developed as a means to investigate these uncertainties under a wide variety of physical assumptions and stellar population formation environments. In this chapter we discuss the development history of population synthesis software with a special focus on work aimed at understanding the formation of gravitational wave populations. We detail the assortment of population synthesis tools in use today that simulate GW populations which are born and evolve in different astrophysical environments. We further discuss the GW population rates and features associated with each environment that have been predicted for both ground and space-based GW detectors. We finish with considerations of future work that combines possible constraints from electromagnetic surveys that may provide key findings that break current degeneracies in population synthesis predictions of GW source populations.</description>

      <title>Realistic predictions for Gaia black hole discoveries: comparison of isolated binary and dynamical formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia has enabled discovery of three dormant black holes (BHs) in au-scale binaries. Numerous models have been proposed to explain their formation, including several that have forecasted Gaia detections. However, previous works have used simplified detectability metrics that do not capture key elements of the Gaia astrometric orbit selection function. We apply a realistic forward-model of Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs to BH binary populations generated through (a) isolated binary evolution (IBE) and (b) dynamical formation in star clusters. For both formation channels, we analyze binary populations in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map. We generate epoch astrometry for each binary from the Gaia scanning law and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models used in Gaia DR3. The IBE model of Chawla et al. (2022) predicts that no BH binaries should have been detected in DR3 and thus significantly underpredicts the formation rate of Gaia BHs. In contrast, the dynamical model of Di Carlo et al. (2024) overpredicts the number of BHs receiving DR3 orbital solutions by a factor of $\sim$8. The two models predict very different orbital period distributions, with the IBE model predicting only binaries that avoided common envelope evolution and have $P_{\text{orb}} \gtrsim 2,000$ d to be detectable, and the dynamical formation model predicting a period distribution that is roughly log-uniform. Adopting the dynamical channel as a fiducial model and rescaling by a factor of 1/8 to match DR3, we predict that $\sim$30 BH binaries will be detected in Gaia DR4, representing $\sim0.1\%$ of Milky Way BHs with luminous companions in au-scale orbits.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects on nearby debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the effect of the ISM on debris disc occurrence rates and on the morphologies of the discs. We used results from the Herschel Space Observatory DUNES and DEBRIS surveys of 295 nearby FGK dwarf stars imaged at 100 $\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m. Most of the 48 debris discs in this sample have small optical depths, making them more likely to be affected by the ISM compared to optically thick discs. Since the stars in our sample are located within the Local Interstellar Cloud, we can infer that their debris discs encounter similar conditions. This allows us to use the stellar space velocity as a single indicator of the forces that can act on the debris disc dust grains when they interact with the ISM. The observed debris disc occurrence rates seem to depend on the stellar space velocities, as expected under the hypothesis that stars with higher space velocities have a higher probability of losing their circumstellar dust. The percentage of sources with debris discs in our sample reaches a maximum of $\approx$25% for stars with low space velocity component values, $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$, relative to the local ISM, and decreases for larger $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ values down to the 10% level. A decrease in the average disc fractional luminosity as a function of $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ is also observed. These dependences do not disappear after accounting for the reported higher dispersion of $U$ values with age. In extended discs, the impact of the ISM could also explain the links observed between the stellar space velocities and the debris disc projected ellipticities, position angles, and radii. Although these indications may not be fully conclusive on their own, they collectively reinforce the hypothesis that the ISM influences the occurrence rates and morphologies of debris discs.</description>

      <title>Candidate RR Lyrae Associated with the Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Aquarius III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the search of RR Lyrae in the vicinity of a newly discovered ultrafaint dwarf galaxy, Aquarius III. Based on the known RR Lyrae catalogs and $gri$-band light curves retrieved from public archives, we identified a RR Lyrae with distance, metallicity, and proper motion consistent with Aquarius III. Therefore, this RR Lyrae is the first variable star identified to be associated with Aquarius III, despite its projected distance is more than 15 times the half-light radius of Aquarius III. On the other hand, a dedicated time-series monitoring of the central part of Aquarius III, out to a projected radius of approximately four half-light radius, revealed there is no RR Lyrae in this region. We ran a set of synthetic color-magnitude diagrams with properties similar to Aquarius III, and found a non-negligible probability that Aquarius III could have (at least one) RR Lyrae. We have also identified a RR Lyrae candidate but most likely it is a background halo star.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Solar Radio Spectrum Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar radio observation is an important way to study the Sun. Solar radio bursts contain important information about solar activity. Therefore, real-time automatic detection and classification of solar radio bursts are of great value for subsequent solar physics research and space weather warnings. Traditional image classification methods based on deep learning often require consid-erable training data. To address insufficient solar radio spectrum images, transfer learning is generally used. However, the large difference between natural images and solar spectrum images has a large impact on the transfer learning effect. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning method for solar radio spectrum classification. Our method uses self-supervised training with a self-masking approach in natural language processing. Self-supervised learning is more conducive to learning the essential information about images compared with supervised methods, and it is more suitable for transfer learning. First, the method pre-trains using a large amount of other existing data. Then, the trained model is fine-tuned on the solar radio spectrum dataset. Experiments show that the method achieves a classification accuracy similar to that of convolutional neural networks and Transformer networks with supervised training.</description>

Abstract: Solar radio observation is a method used to study the Sun. It is very important for space weather early warning and solar physics research to automatically classify solar radio spectrums in real time and judge whether there is a solar radio burst. As the number of solar radio burst spectrums is small and uneven, this paper proposes a classification method for solar radio spectrums based on the Swin transformer. First, the method transfers the parameters of the pretrained model to the Swin transformer model. Then, the hidden layer weights of the Swin transformer are frozen, and the fully connected layer of the Swin transformer is trained on the target dataset. Finally, pa-rameter tuning is performed. The experimental results show that the method can achieve a true positive rate of 100%, which is more accurate than previous methods. Moreover, the number of our model parameters is only 20 million, which is 80% lower than that of the traditional VGG16 con-volutional neural network with more than 130 million parameters.</description>

      <title>The Young Ages of 70 {\mu}m-dark Clumps Inferred from Carbon Chain Chemistry</title>

Abstract: The physical conditions of the earliest environment of high-mass star formation are currently poorly understood. To that end, we present observations of the carbon chain molecules HC$_5$N , CCS, and HC$_7$N in the 22-25 GHz band towards 12 high-mass 70 micron-dark clumps (SMDC) with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We detect HC$_5$N and CCS towards 11 of these SMDC sources. We calculate column densities and abundances relative to H$_2$ for HC$_5$N and CCS. We do not find any clear HC$_7$N detections in the 11 sources individually, but by stacking the HC$_7$N spectra, we do detect HC$_7$N on average in these sources. We also calculate the ratio of the column densities of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N using the stacked spectra of both species. We compare our measured abundances of HC$_5$N and our measured ratio of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N to the UMIST dark cloud chemistry models to constrain an age for the gas assuming a fixed volume density and temperature. The chemical models favor a chemical evolutionary age less than 1 Myr at densities of n(H2) = 2 x 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The consistent carbon-chain detections and young model-derived ages support the conclusion that these 11 70 micron-dark clumps lack high mass protostars because they are young and not because they are inefficient and incapable of high mass star formation.</description>

      <title>Closing the stellar labels gap: Stellar label independent evidence for [$\alpha/M$] information in Gaia BP/RP spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven models for stellar spectra which depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the "stellar labels gap". To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for Gaia BP/RP spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and accompanying 'scatter' without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [$\alpha$/M] information in Gaia XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [$\alpha$/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the $\alpha$-bimodality, without relying on stellar label correlations for stars with $T_{\rm eff} &lt;$ 5000 K, while also being sensitive to the anomalous abundances of Gaia-Enceladus stars. We publicly release our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any/all XP spectra because our model performance scales with training object density, not training label density.</description>

      <title>Radial evolution of a density structure within a solar wind magnetic sector boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) on the 29$^{\text{th}}$ of April 2021 (during a solar minimum), when the two spacecraft were respectively located at $\sim 0.075$ and $\sim 0.9$~au from the Sun. A previous study of this alignment allowed the identification of the same density enhancement (with a time scale of $\sim$1.5~h), and substructures ($\sim$20-30~min timescale), passing first by PSP, and then SolO after a $\sim 138$~h propagation time in the inner heliosphere. We show here that this structure belongs to the large scale heliospheric magnetic sector boundary. In this region, the density is dominated by radial gradients, whereas the magnetic field reversal is consistent with longitudinal gradients in the Carrington reference frame. We estimate the density structure radial size to remain of the order L$_R \sim 10^6$~km, while its longitudinal and latitudinal sizes, are estimated to expand from L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^4$-$10^5$~km in the high solar corona, to L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^5$-$10^6$~km at PSP, and L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^6$-$10^7$~km at SolO. This implies a strong evolution of the structure's aspect ratio during the propagation, due to the plasma's nearly spherical expansion. The structure's shape is therefore inferred to evolve from elongated in the radial direction at $\sim$2-3 solar radii (high corona), to sizes of nearly the same order in all directions at PSP, and then becoming elongated in the directions transverse to the radial at SolO. Measurements are not concordant with local reconnection of open solar wind field lines, so we propose that the structure has been generated through interchange reconnection near the tip of a coronal streamer.</description>

      <title>Small-scale inhomogeneity effects on coherent solar radio emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave excitation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomogeneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the presence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed.</description>

Abstract: White dwarfs and neutron stars are far-reaching and multi-faceted laboratories in the hunt for dark matter. We review detection prospects of wave-like, particulate, macroscopic and black hole dark matter that make use of several exceptional properties of compact stars, such as ultra-high densities, deep fermion degeneracies, low temperatures, nucleon superfluidity, strong magnetic fields, high rotational regularity, and significant gravitational wave emissivity. Foundational topics first made explicit in this document include the effect of the ``propellor phase" on neutron star baryonic accretion, and the contribution of Auger and Cooper pair breaking effects to neutron star heating by dark matter capture.</description>

      <title>Early Accretion of Large Amounts of Solids for Directly-Imaged Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the number of planetary mass objects (PMOs, $\lessapprox$13 M$_{\rm{Jupiter}}$) at wider separation ($\gtrapprox$10 AU) grows, there is emerging evidence that they form differently from their higher-mass brown-dwarf (BD) counterparts. Specifically, PMOs' atmospheres are often enriched by metals and show a large dispersion of metallicity, which is usually interpreted as a sign of solid accretion. {{As a first step toward a population-level study of the amount and timing of solid accretion, }}we analyze a sample of seven directly-imaged exoplanets with measured stellar and planetary chemical abundances (51 Eri b, $\beta$ Pic b, HIP 65426 b, HR 8799 c and e, AF Lep b, and YSES 1 c). Our analysis uses existing data of stellar and planetary atmospheric metallicities, and adopts a Bayesian framework that marginalizes the probabilities of disk conditions, formation locations, {{planetary interior structures}}, and accretion physics. We show that these PMOs accrete large amounts of solids {{regardless of whether they form via core accretion or disk instability}}. On average $\gtrapprox$50 M$_\oplus$ solids are accreted to enrich planet atmospheres. {{Individual planet accretes between 23.3 and 223.2 M$_\oplus$ of solid mass, more than 75\% of which is assumed to stay in the atmosphere and increase the observed metallicity.}} The result implies that the solid accretion process and therefore the planet formation process {{likely take place}} at an early stage {{($\lessapprox$2 Myr)}} when large amounts of solids are available in young {{massive}} protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Spectuner: A Framework for Automated Line Identification of Interstellar Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar molecules, which play an important role in astrochemistry, are identified using observed spectral lines. Despite the advent of spectral analysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains a tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from fully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as ALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a framework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral fitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal human supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line surveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By comparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves an overall recall of ~ 74% - 93%, and an average precision of ~ 78% - 92%. Our code, named Spectuner, is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfv\'en pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfv\'en wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the basis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux tube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>

      <title>Magnetic disk winds in protoplanetary disks: Description of the model and impact on global disk evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.</description>
