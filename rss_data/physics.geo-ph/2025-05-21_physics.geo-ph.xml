      <title>Direct Estimation of Earthquake Source Properties from a Single CCTV Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first direct measurement of the slip-rate function during a natural coseismic rupture, recorded during the 28 March 2025, Mw 7.7 Mandalay earthquake (Myanmar). This measurement was made on a video footage of the surface rupture captured by a security camera located only meters away from the fault trace. Using direct image analysis, we measured the relative slip at each time step and deduced the slip rate. Our results show a local slip duration of 1.3 s, and that the surface slip velocity peaked at nearly 3 m/s during the passage of the slip front, with a cumulative slip of approximately 3 m. These findings demonstrate the pulse-like nature of the seismic rupture, at least at the location of the recording. Using analytical rupture models, we obtain the complete mechanical properties of this pulse including the energy release rate.</description>

      <title>EPBench: A Benchmark for Short-term Earthquake Prediction with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, the significant advancements in artificial intelligence and neural networks have offered the potential to bring new transformations to short-term earthquake prediction research. However, currently, there is no widely used benchmark for this task. To address this, we have built a new benchmark (EPBench), which is, to our knowledge, the first global regional-scale short-term earthquake prediction benchmark. Our benchmark comprises 924,472 earthquake records and 2959 multimodal earthquake records collected from seismic networks around the world. Each record includes basic information such as time, longitude and latitude, magnitude, while each multimodal record includes waveform and moment tensor information additionally, covering a time span from 1970 to 2021.To evaluate performance of models on this task, we have established a series of data partitions and evaluation methods tailored to the short-term earthquake prediction task. We also provide a variety of tools to assist future researchers in partitioning the data according to their geographical understanding. Our benchmark includes a variety of neural network models widely used for time series forecasting, as well as a statistical-based model currently employed by seismological bureaus in several countries. We hope this benchmark will serve as a guide to attract more researchers to explore new methods for addressing this task, which holds great significance for human existence.</description>

      <title>Weighted Multiplier Method for Source-Independent Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian multiplier method has proven highly effective in addressing the ill-conditioning of full waveform inversion (FWI). It enables the development of robust and computationally efficient algorithms capable of converging to accurate velocity models, even from poor initial estimates. Traditionally, these methods optimize an Augmented Lagrangian (AL) function, using a scalar penalty parameter to weight the quadratic penalty term for wave-equation constraint violations. This penalty balances relaxation of the wave equation to improve data fit. However, it imposes uniform relaxation across the model, regardless of source location and the natural decay of seismic amplitudes. To overcome this, we propose a variable penalty strategy that introduces greater flexibility by assigning distance-dependent penalties to the wave-equation constraints. These nonstationary weights apply minimal penalties near the source and larger penalties with increasing distance. This compensates for amplitude decay and allows the wave equation to be satisfied more uniformly across the model. This eliminates the need for explicit source signature estimation and relaxes the requirement for source alignment with grid points, making the method more practical for real applications. The strategy is implemented in the dual formulation of the multiplier method, where model parameters are eliminated, reducing the problem to a fixed-point iteration for source multipliers. Once obtained, model parameters are recovered as a byproduct. Numerical experiments show that this method eliminates explicit source estimation and enhances convexity, improving robustness, convergence, and computational efficiency of FWI.</description>

      <title>Active Protothrusts and Fluid Highways: Seismic Noise Reveals Hidden Subduction Dynamics in Cascadia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex interactions between strain accumulation, fault slip, and fluid migration influence shallow subduction zone dynamics. Using a decade of continuous ambient seismic data from Cascadia seafloor observatories, we identified distinct regional variations in subduction dynamics. Northern Cascadia exhibits a fully locked megathrust with persistent strain accumulation, while central Cascadia displays a slow slip event on protothrusts and rapid fluid migration along fault systems in the overriding plate. Effective fluid transport through the decollement and the Alvin Canyon Fault likely modulates the earthquake behavior but does not cause slow slip events on the megathrust and likely stabilizes large earthquakes, promoting rupture arrest.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>
