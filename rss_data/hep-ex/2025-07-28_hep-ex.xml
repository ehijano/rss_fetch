      <title>Dominance of scale anomaly in confining pressure inside pions on light front in the top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the energy density and the stress distribution inside the pion derived from gravitational form factors in top-down holographic QCD. In particular, we show that the dominance of the scale anomaly in the confining pressure, previously observed in the instant form for the nucleon, also holds for the pion in the light-front form. Furthermore, we find that in large-$N_c$ QCD described by this approach, the scalar glueball plays a mediating role in transmitting the confining pressure. These findings support the universal role of the scale anomaly in the stability of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector molecular structures $B_{c}^{\ast \pm} B_{c}^{\mp}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axial-vector molecular structure $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=(B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{-} + B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+})/2$ is explored in QCD sum rule framework. The mass and current coupling of this compound are found by means of the two-point sum rule method. It turns out that the mass of $\mathcal{M} _{\mathrm{AV}}$ is equal to $m=(12770 \pm 60)~\mathrm{MeV}$ making possible its dissociations to pairs of $J/\psi \eta_b$, $\Upsilon \eta_c$, $ B_{c}^{\ast +} B_{c}^{-}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+}$ mesons. The partial widths of these decay modes contain the strong couplings at $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which are calculated by utilizing the three-point sum rule method. The full decay width of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ is formed due to these dominant processes and amounts to $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(93 \pm 14)~ \mathrm{MeV}$. Our results for parameters $m$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{AV}}]$ of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of various fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

      <title>Development and performance evaluation of a water-based liquid scintillator tracking detector with wavelength-shifting fiber readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a novel tracking detector utilizing a water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) for the accurate characterization of neutrino interactions on a water target. In this detector, the WbLS is optically segmented into small cells by reflective separators, and the scintillation light is read out in three directions using wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers. We developed and optimized WbLS samples for this application and measured their light yield using cosmic-ray muons. Subsequently, we constructed a prototype of the WbLS tracking detector and evaluated its performance with a positron beam. The beam test demonstrated good tracking performance, although the light yield was lower than required. The result prompted a review of the surfactant used in the WbLS and the material of the optical separators, leading to a significant improvement in light yield. In this paper, we report on a design of the WbLS tracking detector, the development of the WbLS, the results of the beam test, and subsequent improvements to the WbLS and optical separators.</description>

      <title>EVAluation of the Equivalent Vector Boson Approximation at highest energy colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collider processes at the highest available partonic center-of-mass energies - 10 TeV and above - exhibit a new regime of electroweak interactions where electroweak gauge bosons mostly act as quasi-massless partons in vector boson fusion processes. We scrutinize these processes using the Equivalent Vector boson Approximation (EVA) based on its implementation in the Monte Carlo generator framework Whizard. Using a variety of important physics processes, including top pairs, Higgs pairs, neutrino pairs, and vector boson pairs, we study the behavior of processes initiated by transverse and longitudinal vector bosons, both $W$ and $Z$ induced. The flexibility of our framework allows to study such processes at different high-energy colliders, such as a muon collider or a high-energy proton collider like FCC-hh. Studying a set of differential distributions, we show which scale choices are the most preferable ones to best approximate results based on full matrix elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of the detector design for the SUB-Millicharge ExperimenT (SUBMET), developed to search for millicharged particles. The experiment probes a largely unexplored region of the charge-mass parameter space, focusing on particles with mass $m_\chi &lt; 1.6~\textrm{GeV}/c^2$ and electric charge $Q &lt; 10^{-3}e$. The detector has been optimized to achieve high sensitivity to interactions of such particles while maintaining effective discrimination against background events. We provide a comprehensive overview of the key detector components, including scintillation modules, photomultiplier tubes, and the mechanical support structure.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of K$^*(892)^{\pm}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first results of K$^*$(892)$^{\pm}$ production at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV as a function of the event multiplicity are presented. The K$^*$(892)$^{\pm}$ has been reconstructed via its hadronic decay channel K$^*$(892)$^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm} + K_{\rm S}^0$ using the ALICE detector at the LHC. For each multiplicity class the differential transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectrum, the mean transverse momentum $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$, the $p_{\rm T}$-integrated yield (d$N$/d$y$), and the ratio of the K$^*$(892)$^{\pm}$ to $K_{\rm S}^0$ yields are reported. These are consistent with previous K$^*$(892)$^0$ resonance results with a higher level of precision. Comparisons with phenomenological models such as PYTHIA6, PYTHIA8, EPOS-LHC, and DIPSY are also discussed. A first evidence of a significant K$^*$(892)$^{\pm}$/$K_{\rm S}^0$ suppression in pp collisions is observed at a 7$\sigma$ level passing from low to high multiplicity events. The ratios of the $p_{\rm T}$-differential yields of K$^*$(892)$^{\pm}$ and $K_{\rm S}^0$ in high and low multiplicity events are also presented along with their double ratio. For $p_{\rm T} \lesssim 2$ GeV/$c$ this double ratio persists below unity by more than $3\sigma$ suggesting that the suppression affects mainly low $p_{\rm T}$ resonances. The measured decreasing trend of the K$^*$(892)$^{\pm}$/$K_{\rm S}^0$ ratio with increasing multiplicity, which in heavy-ion collisions is typically attributed to the rescattering of decay particles of the short-lived resonances, is reproduced by the EPOS-LHC model without the use of hadronic afterburners.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of f$_0$(980) production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dependence of f$_0$(980) production on the final-state charged-particle multiplicity is reported for proton-proton (pp) collisions at the centre-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV. The production of f$_0$(980) is measured with the ALICE detector via the f$_0(980) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel in a midrapidity region of $|y| &lt; 0.5$. The evolution of the integrated yields and mean transverse momentum of f$_{0}$(980) as a function of charged-particle multiplicity measured in pp at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV follows the trends observed in pp at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV and in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV. Particle yield ratios of f$_{0}$(980) to $\pi^{\pm}$ and K$^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ are found to decrease with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. These particle ratios are compared with calculations from the canonical statistical thermal model as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. The thermal model calculations provide a better description of the decreasing trend of particle ratios when no strange or antistrange quark composition for f$_{0}$(980) is assumed, which suggests that the tetraquark interpretation of the f$_{0}$(980) is disfavored.</description>

      <title>Pushing the hybrid approach to low beam energies with dynamic initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While hybrid approaches of relativistic hydrodynamics+transport have been well established for the dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions at high beam energies, moving to lower beam energies is challenging. In this work, we propose dynamic initial conditions for the viscous hydrodynamic evolution in heavy-ion collisions at low to intermediate beam energies. They are comprised of core hadrons based on the local energy density during the pre-equilibrium hadronic evolution. The SMASH-vHLLE hybrid approach is then applied to lower beam energies, achieving good agreement with measured bulk observables between $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 3$ and $9.1\ \mathrm{GeV}$, thus providing guidance for measurements in STAR-BES and CBM at FAIR. This framework has the advantage that the equation of state of dense QCD matter is a direct input to the calculation, so the current results can be regarded as a baseline with respect to future studies of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Search for displaced leptons in $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and $13.6$ TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for leptons displaced from the primary vertex is performed with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search includes the full proton-proton collision dataset collected during Run 2 at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and a partial dataset collected during Run 3 in 2022-2023 at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 140 fb$^{-1}$ and 56.3 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Final states with displaced electrons or muons are considered, and novel triggers introduced in Run 3 are employed that use large impact parameter tracking to reconstruct displaced tracks with low momentum. In addition, photon reconstruction and multivariate techniques are employed to broaden the sensitivity to channels with large background rates or highly displaced electrons, respectively. The results are consistent with the Standard Model background expectations and are used to set model-independent limits on the production of displaced electrons and muons. The analysis is also interpreted in the context of a gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model with pair-produced long-lived sleptons, and a dark sector model with pair-produced chargino-like states. The results include 95% CL exclusions of selectrons with lifetimes from 4 ps to 60 ns and a mass of 150 GeV, and exclusions of selectrons, smuons, and staus with a lifetime of 0.3 ns for masses up to 740 GeV, 830 GeV, and 440 GeV, respectively. Dark charginos with masses up to 380 GeV are excluded for a mass difference with the neutral state of 40 GeV, and mass differences down to 17 GeV are excluded for dark charginos with a 100 GeV mass.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement of the $B^{0}$ meson lifetime using $B^{0} \rightarrow J/\psi K^{*0}$ decays with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement of the $B^{0}$ meson lifetime and related properties using $B^0 \to J/\psi K^{*0}$ decays in data from 13 TeV proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The measured effective lifetime is $$ \tau = 1.5053 \pm 0.0012 ~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.0035 ~\mathrm{(syst.)~ps}. $$ The average decay width extracted from the effective lifetime, using parameters from external sources, is $$ \Gamma_d = 0.6639 \pm 0.0005 ~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.0016 ~\mathrm{(syst.)}\pm 0.0038 ~\textrm{(ext.)} \textrm{ ps}^{-1}, $$ where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and from external sources. The earlier ATLAS measurement of $\Gamma_s$ in the $B^0_s \to J/\psi\phi$ decay was used to derive a value for the ratio of the average decay widths $\Gamma_d$ and $\Gamma_s$ for $B^{0}$ and $B_s^{0}$ mesons respectively, of $$ \frac{\Gamma_d }{\Gamma_s } = 0.9905 \pm 0.0022 ~\textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.0036 ~\textrm{(syst.)} \pm 0.0057 ~\textrm{(ext.)}. $$ The measured lifetime, average decay width and decay width ratio are in agreement with theoretical predictions and with measurements by other experiments. This measurement provides the most precise result of the effective lifetime of the $B^{0}$ meson to date.</description>

      <title>Flavor Physics at the CEPC: a General Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the landscape of flavor physics at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), based on the nominal luminosity outlined in its Technical Design Report. The CEPC is designed to operate in multiple modes to address a variety of tasks. At the $Z$ pole, the expected production of 4 Tera $Z$ bosons will provide unique and highly precise measurements of $Z$ boson couplings, while the substantial number of boosted heavy-flavored quarks and leptons produced in clean $Z$ decays will facilitate investigations into their flavor physics with unprecedented precision. We investigate the prospects of measuring various physics benchmarks and discuss their implications for particle theories and phenomenological models. Our studies indicate that, with its highlighted advantages and anticipated excellent detector performance, the CEPC can explore beauty and $\tau$ physics in ways that are superior to or complementary with the Belle II and Large-Hadron-Collider-beauty experiments, potentially enabling the detection of new physics at energy scales of 10 TeV and above. This potential also extends to the observation of yet-to-be-discovered rare and exotic processes, as well as testing fundamental principles such as lepton flavor universality, lepton and baryon number conservation, etc., making the CEPC a vibrant platform for flavor physics research. The $WW$ threshold scan, Higgs-factory operation and top-pair productions of the CEPC further enhance its merits in this regard, especially for measuring the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, and Flavor-Changing-Neutral-Current physics of Higgs boson and top quarks. We outline the requirements for detector performance and considerations for future development to achieve the anticipated scientific goals.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a first measurement of the cross-section for the charged-current Drell-Yan process $pp\rightarrow W^{\pm} \rightarrow \ell^{\pm} \nu$ above the resonance region, where $\ell$ is an electron or muon. The measurement is performed for transverse masses, $m_{\text{T}}^{\text{W}}$, between 200 GeV and 5000 GeV, using a sample of 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015-2018. The data are presented single differentially in transverse mass and double differentially in transverse mass and absolute lepton pseudorapidity. A test of lepton flavour universality shows no significant deviations from the Standard Model. The electron and muon channel measurements are combined to achieve a total experimental precision of 3% at low $m_{\text{T}}^{\text{W}}$. The single- and double differential $W$-boson charge asymmetries are evaluated from the measurements. A comparison to next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions using several recent parton distribution functions and including next-to-leading-order electroweak effects indicates the potential of the data to constrain parton distribution functions. The data are also used to constrain four fermion operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory formalism, in particular the lepton-quark operator Wilson coefficient $c_{\ell q}^{(3)}.$</description>

      <title>Fragmentation Functions of Charged Hadrons at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order and Constraints on the Proton Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first global analysis of fragmentation functions (FFs) for light charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$) at full next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), incorporating world data from both single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering. The collinear factorization has been tested with low-momentum-transfer data and has demonstrated success at high hadron momenta. Additionally, we study the impact of current global data on hadron production to the parton distribution functions (PDFs), and find they favor a reduced asymmetry in the strange (anti-) quark PDFs, as compared to the asymmetry predicted by state-of-the-art PDFs derived from inclusive data.</description>

      <title>Energy-Enhanced Expansion of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize energy-scaling arguments in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to estimate effects of operators up to dimension ten. Introducing a classification based on the number of external legs and an energy-counting parameter, we establish a dual expansion in \(v/\Lambda\) and \(E/\Lambda\). Extending to four-, five-, and six-particle vertices, our framework highlights energy-enhanced operators that dominate high-energy processes at the HL-LHC. This organization streamlines experimental analyses to only include operators with energetic impact in their analyses and enhances the discoverability of new physics within the SMEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-six baryon-number-violating operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the second part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): the baryon-number-violating sector at dimension six in the power counting. We obtain the results in two different schemes: in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations; and in naive dimensional regularization, which in the considered sector of the theory does not lead to any ill-defined $\gamma_5$-odd traces. Our results are of interest for a reanalysis of the constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model from proton-decay searches within an EFT framework at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Operation of a dual-phase xenon detector with wavelength sensitivity from ultraviolet to infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Xenon, in both its gaseous and liquid phase, offers excellent scintillation and ionization properties, making it an ideal target medium for rare event searches. We report on measurements performed with a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber sensitive to wavelengths from 170 nm to 1700 nm. In addition to the well-established ultraviolet (UV) scintillation, we observe coincident signals in a photomultiplier tube sensitive to infrared (IR) light, associated with both prompt scintillation in the liquid and electroluminescence in the gas. We study the time response of the IR signals and their dependence on the applied amplification field in the gas. Our findings support the observation of IR emission from electroluminescence and reveal a time response distinct from that previously reported for $\alpha$-particles in gas. The results suggest that IR scintillation could provide enhanced signal identification and background rejection in future xenon-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Lateral Amorphous Selenium Photodetectors for Low-Photon and VUV Detection at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of amorphous selenium (a-Se) as a cryogenic photodetector material is evaluated through a series of experiments using laterally structured devices operated in a custom optical test stand. These studies investigate the response of a-Se detectors to low-photon fluxes at high electric fields near avalanche conditions, the linearity of the photoconductive response over a wide dynamic range and the direct detection of narrowband 130 nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) illumination. At 87 K, matched-filter analysis shows reliable single-shot detection with efficiencies greater than or equal to 80 percent and area under the curve (AUC) greater than or equal to 0.85 using as few as approximately 6800 incident 401 nm photons, corresponding to approximately 3400 photons within field-active regions after accounting for geometric constraints. Measurements are performed at cryogenic temperatures using calibrated photon fluxes derived from a silicon photomultiplier reference and a characterized optical filter stack. Additional experiments using a tellurium-doped a-Se (a-SeTe) device explore the material's behavior under identical test conditions and demonstrate that avalanche is achievable in a-SeTe at cryogenic temperatures. The results demonstrate reproducible low-noise operation, VUV sensitivity and field-dependent gain behavior in a lateral a-Se architecture, representing the first reported observation of avalanche multiplication in laterally structured a-Se and a-SeTe devices at cryogenic temperatures. These findings support the potential integration of laterally structured a-Se devices into next-generation pixelated liquid-argon time projection chambers (TPCs) requiring scalable, high-field-compatible photon detection systems.</description>
