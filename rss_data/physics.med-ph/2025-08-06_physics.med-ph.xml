      <title>Mechanical characterization of pharmaceutical powders and correlation with their behavior during grinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the size of powder particles is pivotal in the design of many pharmaceutical forms and the related manufacturing processes and plants. One of the most common techniques for particle size reduction in process industry is powder milling, whose efficiency relates to the mechanical properties of powder particles themselves. In this work, we first characterize the elastic and plastic response of different pharmaceutical powders by measuring their Young modulus, the hardness and the brittleness index via nano-indentation. Subsequently, we analyze the behavior of those powder samples during comminution via jet-mill at different process conditions. Finally, the correlation between single particle mechanical properties and milling process results is illustrated; the possibility to build a predictive model for powder grindability, based on nano-indentation data, is critically discussed</description>

      <title>Optimal control driven functional electrical stimulation: A scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Rehabilitation after a neurological impairment can be supported by functional electrical stimulation (FES). However, FES is limited by early muscle fatigue, slowing down the recovery progress. The use of optimal control to reduce overstimulation and improve motion precision is gaining interest. This review aims to map the current literature state meanwhile clarifying the best practices, identifying persistent challenges, and outlining directions for future research. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted up to February 2024 using the combined keywords "FES", "optimal control" or "fatigue" across five databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Citation Index). Inclusion criteria included the use of optimal control with FES for healthy individuals and those with neuromuscular disorders. Results: Among the 44 included studies, half were in silico and half in vivo, involving 87 participants, predominantly healthy young men. Twelve different motor tasks were investigated, with a focus on single joint lower limb movements. These studies principally used simple FES models, modulating pulse width or intensity to track joint angle. Conclusions: Optimal control-driven FES can deliver precise motions and reduce fatigue. Yet clinical adoption is slowed down by the lack of consensus about modelling, inconvenient model identification protocol and limited validation. Additional barriers include insufficient open-science practices, computational performance reporting and the availability of customizable commercial hardware. Comparative FES model studies and longitudinal trials with large cohorts, among other efforts, are required to improve the technology readiness level. Such advances would help clinical adoption and improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Timing is everything: How subtle timing changes in MRI echo planar imaging can significantly alter mechanical vibrations and sound level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern MRI relies on the well-established Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) method for fast acquisition. EPI is the workhorse of diffusion and functional MRI in neuroscience as well as of many dynamic applications for clinical body imaging. Its speed stems from rapidly switching currents through the gradient coils responsible for spatial encoding. These quick changes, within a strong static magnetic field induce Lorentz forces that generate mechanical vibrations, leading to the loud, characteristic MRI noise. This acoustic noise is already a significant concern in standard clinical scanners, requiring hearing protection and risking image degradation or even hardware strain. In ultra-high-field systems, the issue is exacerbated due to stronger Lorentz forces. In this study, we introduce a novel model that characterizes the acoustic spectrum for a given EPI scan. The spectrum results from interference between multiple identical periods of alternating currents, making the relative timing between them a key factor. We show that even subtle timing changes significantly alter the sound level. Scans of either high spatial resolution or high temporal resolution, on clinical 7T and investigational 10.5T human scanners, corroborated the model and its predicted acoustics spectra. Acoustic energy changes of up to 47-fold were reached in close to mechanical resonances and up to 5-fold in other regions. Intriguingly, under certain conditions, doubling the acquisitions per unit time actually reduced the minimal acoustic energy two-fold. Not less important, ghosting-artifacts exhibit strong dependence on the scan's acoustic characteristics and the benefit of subtle time delays of internal correction-acquisitions (navigators) is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$--Based Radiation Detector for Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is an advanced cancer treatment modality that offers significant advantages over conventional X-ray therapies, particularly in its ability to minimize radiation dose beyond the tumor target. This reduction in unnecessary irradiation exposure significantly lowers the risk to surrounding healthy tissue and reduces side effects compared to conventional X-ray treatments. However, due to the high complexity of IMPT plans, each plan must be independently validated to ensure the safety and efficacy of the radiation exposure to the patient. While ion chambers are currently used for this purpose, their limitations-particularly in angled-beam measurements and multi-depth assessments-hinder their effectiveness. Silicon-based detectors, commonly used in X-ray therapy, are unsuitable for IMPT due to their rapid degradation under proton irradiation. In this study, a $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector was evaluated and compared with a commercial ion chamber using a MEVION S250i proton accelerator. The $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector demonstrated reliable detection of single-pulse proton doses as low as 0.26 MU and exhibited a linear charge-to-dose relationship across a wide range of irradiation conditions. Furthermore, its measurement variability was comparable to that of the ion chamber, with improved sensitivity observed at higher bias voltages. These results highlight the strong potential of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a radiation-hard detector material for accurate dose verification in IMPT.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Dynamic Full-Field Optical Coherence Microscopy: Illuminating Intracellular Activity in Deep Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic full-field optical coherence microscopy (d-FF-OCM) is a label-free imaging technique that captures intrinsic subcellular motions to generate functional contrast. This dynamic approach yields images with fluorescence-like contrast, highlighting active structures without the need for fluorescent labels. However, current d-FF-OCM implementations struggle to image deep within highly scattering tissues at high resolution. Here, we present a new high-resolution d-FF-OCM system that overcomes these limitations, enabling much deeper high-resolution imaging in such tissues. The setup uses 100x oil-immersion objectives (NA = 1.25) and a high-brightness, laser-pumped incoherent white light source to achieve nanometer-scale resolution at depths up to approximately 100 micrometers in highly scattering samples. We also incorporate real-time reference arm adjustment to maintain signal strength and contrast as the focus moves deeper into the sample. Using this system, we imaged fresh ex vivo mouse liver and small intestine with unprecedented depth and detail. In these tissues, the dynamic contrast clearly revealed fine structures not visible with conventional OCT-for example, the sinusoidal microvasculature and organized cell layers in the liver, as well as neural plexuses and crypts in the intestine-all visualized label-free. By bridging the gap between high-resolution and deep imaging in highly scattering tissue, this advance provides a powerful new tool for biological microscopy, with potential applications from fundamental research to rapid intraoperative pathology.</description>
