      <title>Self-modulated multimode silicon cavity optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode cavity optomechanics, where multiple mechanical degrees of freedom couple to optical cavity modes, provides a rich platform for exploring nonlinear dynamics and engineering complex interactions. In this work, we investigate the interplay between two mechanical modes with similar characteristics and a self-induced nonlinear modulation of intra-cavity power (self-pulsing) driven by free-carrier dispersion and thermo-optic effects in silicon. Notably, the self-pulsing dynamics adapts to the optomechanically induced perturbations from both mechanical modes, enabling simultaneous synchronous pumping and driving them into a stable state characterized by high-amplitude, self-sustained, and coherent oscillations. This result effectively overcomes the strong mode competition typically observed in modes with similar spatial distributions and frequency scales. Remarkably, this regime is achieved even when the mechanical frequencies do not satisfy a harmonic relation, leading to quasi-periodic or chaotic intra-cavity power dynamics, while the mechanical modes maintain coherent, high-amplitude oscillations. These results, supported by a numerical model that accurately predicts the dynamics of the system, open new pathways for the generation and control of multi-phonon coherent sources in chip-integrated silicon platforms.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dual cascade in gravitational wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate, in both the forced and decay regimes, a fourth-order nonlinear diffusion equation derived from the kinetic equation of gravitational wave turbulence in the limit of strongly local quartic interactions. When a forcing is applied to an intermediate wavenumber $k_i$, we observe a dual cascade of energy and wave action. In the stationary state, the associated flux ratio is proportional to $k_i$, and the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra are recovered. In decaying turbulence, the study reveals that the wave action spectrum can extend to wavenumbers greater than the initial excitation $k_i$ with constant negative flux, while the energy flux is positive with a power law dependence in $k$. This leads to an unexpected result: a single inertial range with a Kolmogorov-Zakharov wave action spectrum extending progressively to wavenumbers larger than $k_i$. We also observe a wave action decay in time in $t^{-1/3}$ while the front of the energy spectrum progresses according to a $t^{1/3}$ law. These properties can be understood with simple theoretical arguments.</description>

      <title>Robust methods to detect coupling among nonlinear time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two numerical methods are proposed for detection of coupling between multiple time series generated by deterministic nonlinear systems. The first detects interdependence or the existence of coupling between time series. The second ascertains directionality of coupling, or alternatively, latent coupling, the case when multiple series are driven by another, unobserved system. In either case, the driver and the recipients of the coupling may be periodic or aperiodic, and in particular may be chaotic. The only inputs to the method are two or more simultaneously recorded time series. The methods rely solely on ranking distances between states in time-delay reconstructions of the data, and for that reason tend to be robust to observational noise.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this paper, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we first show that almost all learned periods are unstable and each network has its characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). The latently acquired dynamics, which are unstable within the trained network, serve as a foundation for the diversity of characteristic attractors and may even lead to the emergence of attractors of all periods after learning. When the neural network interpolation is quadratic, a universal post-learning bifurcation scenario appears, which is consistent with a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map. In addition to universality, we explore specific properties of certain networks, including the singular behavior at the infinite scale of weights limit and the symmetry in learning period three.</description>
