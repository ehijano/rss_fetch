      <title>The method of $a$-contraction with shifts used for long-time behavior toward viscous shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the method of $a$-contraction with shifts used for long-time behavior of barotropic Navier-Stokes flows perturbed from a Riemann shock. For the usage of the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, we do not employ the effective velocity $h$ variable even for higher order estimates. This approach would be important when handling the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with other effects, for example, such as capillary effect and boundary effect.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation near the outflow boundary in the vanishing viscosity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes and Euler equations in a bounded domain with non-characteristic boundary condition, and study the energy dissipation near the outflow boundary in the zero-viscosity limit. We show that in a general setting, the energy dissipation rate is proportional to $\bar U \bar V ^2$, where $\bar U$ is the strength of the suction and $\bar V$ is the tangential component of the difference between Euler and Navier-Stokes on the outflow boundary. Moreover, we show that the enstrophy within a layer of order $\nu / \bar U$ is comparable with the total enstrophy. The rate of enstrophy production near the boundary is inversely proportional to $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear smoothing for the periodic dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equations with polynomial nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the periodic dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equations with polynomial nonlinearity. We establish the nonlinear smoothing properties of these equations, according to which the difference between the solution and the linear evolution is smoother than the initial data. In addition, we establish new local well-posedness results for these equations when the dispersion is sufficiently large. Our method also improves known local well-posedness results for a class of non-integrable fifth-order KdV equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff for soft potentials. For any given initial datum such that the mass, energy and entropy densities are bounded and the mass is away from vacuum, we establish the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of mild solutions, and further provide the first result on sharp smoothing effect in analytic space or Gevrey space for soft potentials.</description>

      <title>Global solvability and unboundedness in a fully parabolic quasilinear chemotaxis model with indirect signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a quasilinear chemotaxis model with indirect signal production, $u_t = \nabla\cdot(D(u)\nabla u - S(u)\nabla v)$, $v_t = \Delta v - v + w$ and $w_t = \Delta w - w + u$, posed on a bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, subjected to homogenerous Neumann boundary conditions, where nonlinear diffusion $D$ and sensitivity $S$ generalize the prototype $D(s) = (s+1)^{-\alpha}$ and $S(s) = (s+1)^{\beta-1}s$.
  Ding and Wang [M.Ding and W.Wang, Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. Ser. B, 24 (2019), 4665-4684.] showed that the system possesses a globally bounded classical solution if $\alpha + \beta &lt;\min\{1+2/n,4/n\}$. While for the J\"ager-Luckhaus variant of this model, namely the second equation replaced by $0=\Delta v - \int_\Omega w/|\Omega| + w$, Tao and Winkler [2023, preprint] announced that if $\alpha + \beta &gt; 4/n$ and $\beta&gt;2/n$ for $n\geq3$, with radial assumptions, the variant admits occurrence of finite-time blowup.
  We focus on the case $\beta&lt;2/n$, and prove that $\beta &lt; 2/n$ for $n\geq2$ is sufficient for global solvability of classical solutions; if $\alpha + \beta &gt; 4/n$ for $n\geq4$, then radially symmetric initial data with large negative energy enforce blowup happening in finite or infinite time, both of which imply that the system allows infinite-time blowup if $\alpha + \beta &gt; 4/n$ and $\beta &lt; 2/n$ for $n\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Singularities of solutions of nonlocal nonlinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local behavior of weak solutions, with possible singularities, of nonlocal nonlinear equations. We first prove that sets of capacity zero are removable for weak solutions under certain integrability conditions. We then characterize the asymptotic behavior of singular solutions near an isolated singularity in terms of the fundamental solution.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of critical orbits to nonlinear, strongly indefinite functionals with sign-changing nonlinear part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show an abstract critical point theorem about existence of infinitely many critical orbits to strongly indefinite functionals with sign-changing nonlinear part defined on a dislocation space with a discrete group action. We apply the abstract result to a Schr\"odinger equation $$ -\Delta u + V(x) u = f(u) - \lambda g(u) $$ with $0$ in the spectral gap of the Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta + V(x)$, that appears in nonlinear optics, as well as to the equations with singular potentials arising from the study of cylindrically symmetric, electromagnetic waves to the system of Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for a population model with growth, division and cross-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally motivated by the morphogenesis of bacterial microcolonies, the aim of this article is to explore models through different scales for a spatial population of interacting, growing and dividing particles. We start from a microscopic stochastic model, write the corresponding stochastic differential equation satisfied by the empirical measure, and rigorously derive its mesoscopic (mean-field) limit. Under smoothness and symmetry assumptions for the interaction kernel, we then obtain entropy estimates, which provide us with a localization limit at the macroscopic level. Finally, we perform a thorough numerical study in order to compare the three modeling scales.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the heat equation in an exterior domain with general boundary conditions II. The case of bounded and of $L^{p}$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the heat equation in exterior domains, i.e., domains which are the complement of a smooth compact set in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Different homogeneous boundary conditions are considered, including Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann ones. In this second part of our work, we consider the case of bounded initial data and prove that, after some correction term, the solutions become close to the solutions in the whole space and show how complex behaviours appear. We also analyse the case of initial data in $L^p$ with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ where all solutions essentially decay to $0$ and the convergence rate could be arbitrarily slow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour, as $p \to +\infty$, of the second eigenvalues of the $p$-Laplacian with Robin boundary conditions and the limit of the associated eigenfunctions. We prove that, up to some regularity of the set, the limit of the second eigenvalues is actually the second eigenvalue of the so-called $\infty$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the support of semiclassical measures for higher-dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cat maps are toy models in quantum chaos associated to hyperbolic symplectic matrices $A\in \operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{Z})$. The macroscopic limits of sequences of eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map are characterized by semiclassical measures on the torus $\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. We show that if the characteristic polynomial of every power $A^k$ is irreducible over the rationals, then every semiclassical measure has full support. The proof uses an earlier strategy of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] and the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen [arXiv:2305.05022]. Our irreducibility condition is generically true, in fact we show that asymptotically for $100\%$ of matrices $A$, the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $S_2 \wr S_n$.
  When the irreducibility condition does not hold, we show that a semiclassical measure cannot be supported on a finite union of parallel non-coisotropic subtori. On the other hand, we give examples of semiclassical measures supported on the union of two transversal symplectic subtori for $n=2$, inspired by the work of Faure-Nonnenmacher-De Bi\`evre [arXiv:nlin/0207060] in the case $n=1$. This is complementary to the examples by Kelmer [arXiv:math-ph/0510079] of semiclassical measures supported on a single coisotropic subtorus.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of compressible rotating Euler equations with low Mach and Rossby numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the low Mach and Rossby number singular limits and longtime existence of strong solution to the initial value problem of 3D compressible rotating Euler equations with ill-prepared initial data. We establish the Strichartz decay estimates that are uniform to the Mach number, the Rossby number, and the ratio of these two parameters for the associated linear propagator without any restrictions on the frequency. In particular, difficulties arisen from the degeneracy of the phase function and the vanishing of the ratio of the two parameters are addressed by elaborately designed splitting techniques and discussions for each frequencies. Using the decay estimates, we prove the longtime existence and obtain a rate of convergence to zero of strong solution to the compressible rotating Euler equations with initial data of finite energy in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>The Logarithmic Sobolev inequality on non-compact self-shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we establish an optimal logarithmic Sobolev inequality for complete, non-compact, properly embedded self-shrinkers in the Euclidean space, which generalizes a recent result of Brendle \cite{Brendle22} for closed self-shrinkers. We first provide a proof for the logarithmic Sobolev inequality in the Euclidean space by using the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) method. Then we use this approach to show an optimal logarithmic Sobolev inequality for complete, non-compact, properly embedded self-shrinkers in the Euclidean space, which is a sharp version of the result of Ecker in \cite{Ecker}. The proof is a noncompact modification of Brendle's proof for closed submanifolds and has a big potential to provide new inequalities in noncompact manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological localised interface modes to systems with damping. The spectral problem is formulated as a root-finding problem for the interface impedance function and Rouch\'e's theorem is used to track the zeros when damping is introduced. We show that the localised eigenfrequencies, corresponding to interface modes, remain for non-zero dampings. Using the transfer matrix method, we explicitly characterise the decay rate of the interface mode.</description>

      <title>A new framework for particle-wave interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In plasma physics, collisionless charged particles are transported following the dynamics of a meanfield Vlasov equation with a self-consistent electric field generated by the charge density. Due to the long range interaction between particles, the generating electric field oscillates and disperses like a Klein-Gordon dispersive wave, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves. The oscillatory electric field in turn drives particles. Despite its great physical importance, the question of whether such a nonlinear particle-wave interaction would remain regular globally and be damped in the large time has been an outstanding open problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework to resolve this exact nonlinear interaction. Specifically, we employ the framework to establish the large time behavior and scattering of solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Klein-Gordon system in the small initial data regime. The novelty of this work is to provide a detailed physical space description of particles moving in an oscillatory field and to resolve oscillations for the electric field generated by the collective interacting particles. This appears to be the first such a result analyzing oscillations in the physical phase space $\mathbb{R}^3_x\times \mathbb{R}_v^3$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of three-dimensional Damped Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical analysis of the evolution of a mixture of two incompressible, isothermal fluids flowing through a porous medium in a three dimensional bounded domain. The model is governed by a coupled system of convective Brinkman Forchheimer equations and the Cahn Hilliard equation, considering a regular potential and non degenerate mobility. We first establish the existence of a Leray Hopf weak solution for the coupled system when the absorption exponent r greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, we prove that every weak solution satisfies the energy equality for greater than 3. This further leads to the uniqueness of weak solutions in three-dimensional bounded domains, subject to certain restrictions on the viscosity and the Forchheimer coefficient in the critical case r=3. Moreover, we provide an alternative simplified proof for the uniqueness of weak solutions for r greater than or equal to 3 that holds without imposing any restrictions on viscosity or Forchheimer coefficient. Similar results are also obtained for the case of degenerate mobility and singular potential.</description>

      <title>Hardy's Uncertainty principle for Schr\"odinger equations with quadratic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardy's uncertainty principle is a classical result in harmonic analysis, stating that a function in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and its Fourier transform cannot both decay arbitrarily fast at infinity. In this paper, we extend this principle to the propagators of Schr\"odinger equations with quadratic Hamiltonians, known in the literature as metaplectic operators. These operators generalize the Fourier transform and have captured significant attention in recent years due to their wide-ranging applications in time-frequency analysis, quantum harmonic analysis, signal processing, and various other fields. However, the involved structure of these operators requires careful analysis, and most results obtained so far concern special propagators that can basically be reduced to rescaled Fourier transforms. The main contributions of this work are threefold: (1) we extend Hardy's uncertainty principle, covering all propagators of Schr\"odinger equations with quadratic Hamiltonians, (2) we provide concrete examples, such as fractional Fourier transforms, which arise when considering anisotropic harmonic oscillators, (3) we suggest Gaussian decay conditions in certain directions only, which are related to the structure of the corresponding symplectic projection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the existence of Brakke-type weak mean curvature flow satisfying the contact angle condition for general angle $ \theta \in ( 0 , \pi ) $ via Ilmanen's regularization. The main ingredients of the result are the establishment of a compactness theorem for varifolds with the contact angle and the extension of Ilmanen's regularization to the capillarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers large-data asymptotics for t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), a widely-used non-linear dimension reduction algorithm. We identify an appropriate continuum limit of the tSNE objective function, which can be viewed as a combination of a kernel-based repulsion and an asymptotically-vanishing Laplacian-type regularizer. As a consequence, we show that embeddings of the original tSNE algorithm cannot have any consistent limit as $n \to \infty$. We propose a rescaled model which mitigates the asymptotic decay of the attractive energy, and which does have a consistent limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Stochastic Modeling and Regularity in Turbulent Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations by integrating Sobolev-Besov hybrid spaces with fractional operators and quantum-inspired dynamics. We propose new regularity theorems that address the multiscale and chaotic nature of fluid flows, offering novel insights into energy dissipation mechanisms. The introduction of a Schr\"odinger-like operator into the fluid dynamics model captures quantum-scale turbulence effects, enhancing our understanding of energy redistribution across different scales. The results also include the development of anisotropic stochastic models that account for direction-dependent viscosity, improving the representation of real-world turbulent flows. These advances in stochastic modeling and regularity analysis provide a comprehensive toolset for tackling complex fluid dynamics problems. The findings are applicable to fields such as engineering, quantum turbulence, and environmental sciences. Future directions include the numerical implementation of the proposed models and the use of machine learning techniques to optimize parameters for enhanced simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Geometric spectral optimization on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of optimal metrics for a wide class of combinations of Laplace eigenvalues on closed orientable surfaces of any genus. The optimal metrics are explicitely related to Laplace minimal eigenmaps, defined as branched minimal immersions into ellipsoids parametrized by the eigenvalues of the critical metrics whose coordinates are eigenfunctions with respect to these eigenvalues. In particular, we prove existence of maximal metrics for the first Laplace eigenvalue on orientable surfaces of any genus. In this case, the target of eigenmaps are spheres. This completes a broad picture, first drawn by J. Hersch, 1970 (sphere), M. Berger 1973, N. Nadirashvili 1996 (tori). Our result is based on the combination of accurate constructions of Palais-Smale-like sequences for spectral functionals and on techniques by M. Karpukhin, R. Kusner, P. McGrath, D. Stern 2024, developped in the case of an equivariant optimization of the first Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues. Their result is significantly extended for two reasons: specific equivariant optimizations are not required anymore to obtain existence of maximizers of the first eigenvalue for any topology and our technique also holds for combinations of eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Phenotype structuring in collective cell migration:a tutorial of mathematical models and methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populations are heterogeneous, deviating in numerous ways. Phenotypic diversity refers to the range of traits or characteristics across a population, where for cells this could be the levels of signalling, movement and growth activity, etc. Clearly, the phenotypic distribution -- and how this changes over time and space -- could be a major determinant of population-level dynamics. For instance, across a cancerous population, variations in movement, growth, and ability to evade death may determine its growth trajectory and response to therapy. In this review, we discuss how classical partial differential equation (PDE) approaches for modelling cellular systems and collective cell migration can be extended to include phenotypic structuring. The resulting non-local models -- which we refer to as phenotype-structured partial integro-differential equations (PS-PIDEs) -- form a sophisticated class of models with rich dynamics. We set the scene through a brief history of structured population modelling, and then review the extension of several classic movement models -- including the Fisher-KPP and Keller-Segel equations -- into a PS-PIDE form. We proceed with a tutorial-style section on derivation, analysis, and simulation techniques. First, we show a method to formally derive these models from underlying agent-based models. Second, we recount travelling waves in PDE models of spatial spread dynamics and concentration phenomena in non-local PDE models of evolutionary dynamics, and combine the two to deduce phenotypic structuring across travelling waves in PS-PIDE models. Third, we discuss numerical methods to simulate PS-PIDEs, illustrating with a simple scheme based on the method of lines and noting the finer points of consideration. We conclude with a discussion of future modelling and mathematical challenges.</description>

      <title>Wigner Representation of Schr\"odinger Propagators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a Wigner analysis of Fourier integral operators (FIOs), whose main examples are Schr\"odinger propagators arising from quadratic Hamiltonians with bounded perturbations. The perturbation is given by a pseudodifferential operator $\sigma(x,D)$ with symbol in the H\"ormander class $S^0_{0,0}(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$. We compute and study the Wigner kernel of these operators. They are special instances of a more general class of FIOs named $FIO(S)$, with $S$ the symplectic matrix representing the classical symplectic map. We shall show the algebra and the Wiener's property of this class. The algebra will be the fundamental tool to represent the Wigner kernel of the Schr\"odinger propagator for every $t\in\mathbb{R}^d$, also in the caustic points. This outcome underlines the validity of the Wigner analysis for the study of Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of weak solutions of a class of multi-species cross-diffusion systems as well as the propagation of chaos result by means of nonlocal approximation of the nonlinear diffusion terms, coupling methods and compactness arguments. We also prove the uniqueness under further structural assumption on the mobilities by combining the uniqueness argument for viscous porous medium equations and linear Fokker-Planck equations. We show that these equations capture the macroscopic behavior of stochastic interacting particle systems if the localisation parameter is chosen logarithmically with respect to the number of particles.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the point-vortex dynamics with positive intensities. We show that in the half-plane and in a disk, collapses of point vortices with the boundary in finite time are impossible, hence the solution of the dynamics is global in time. We also give some necessary conditions for the existence of collapses with the boundary in general smooth bounded domains, in particular, that the trajectory of at least one point vortex has no limit. Some minor results are obtained with unsigned intensities.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of minimizers for classical capillarity problems in presence of nonlocal repulsion and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal interaction term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal interaction term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses and general nonlocal interaction terms, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at ``infinite distance'' one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>

Abstract: Global existence of very weak solutions to a non-local diffusion-advection-reaction equation is established under no-flux boundary conditions in higher dimensions. The equation features degenerate myopic diffusion and nonlocal adhesion and is an extension of a mass-conserving model recently derived in arXiv:2308.05676. The admissible degeneracy of the diffusion tensor is characterised in terms of the upper box fractal dimension.</description>

Abstract: In this note we study the well-posedness of two systems of Burgers type arising in nonlinear wave interactions. The first model describes the interaction of a Burger's bore with the classical Korteweg-de Vries equation while the second exemplify the interaction of weak sound waves and entropy waves with small amplitudes. For the former, we show the local existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces and Wiener-type spaces. For the latter, we provide an elementary proof of finite time singularity.</description>

      <title>Discretization of fractional fully nonlinear equations by powers of discrete Laplacians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discretizations of fractional fully nonlinear equations by powers of discrete Laplacians. Our problems are parabolic and of order $\sigma\in(0,2)$ since they involve fractional Laplace operators $(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$. They arise e.g. in control and game theory as dynamic programming equations -- HJB and Isaacs equation -- and solutions are non-smooth in general and should be interpreted as viscosity solutions. Our approximations are realized as finite-difference quadrature approximations and are 2nd order accurate for all values of $\sigma$. The accuracy of previous approximations of fractional fully nonlinear equations depend on $\sigma$ and are worse when $\sigma$ is close to $2$. We show that the schemes are monotone, consistent, $L^\infty$-stable, and convergent using a priori estimates, viscosity solutions theory, and the method of half-relaxed limits. We also prove a second order error bound for smooth solutions and present many numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d&gt;2$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge to the same limit in law. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to be valid throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>
