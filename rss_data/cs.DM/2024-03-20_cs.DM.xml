      <title>Resolving Sets in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $\textit{resolving set}$ $R$ in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is uniquely identified by its distances to the vertices of $R$. Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic point of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs, i.e., graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the $\textit{temporal distance}$ from $u$ to $v$ is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, i.e., the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A $\textit{temporal resolving set}$ of a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$.
  We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step 1 or 2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.</description>

      <title>Causal Graph Dynamics and Kan Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic.The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling.The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones.On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled.In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well.This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics.Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description>

      <title>String attractors and bi-infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String attractors are a combinatorial tool coming from the field of data compression. It is a set of positions within a word which intersects an occurrence of every factor. While one-sided infinite words admitting a finite string attractor are eventually periodic, the situation is different for two-sided infinite words. In this paper, we characterise the bi-infinite words admitting a finite string attractor as the characteristic Sturmian words and their morphic images. For words that do not admit finite string attractors, we study the structure and properties of their infinite string attractors.</description>

      <title>Towards the Characterization of Terminal Cut Functions: a Condition for Laminar Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the following characterization problem. Given a set $T$ of terminals and a $(2^{|T|}-2)$-dimensional vector $\pi$ whose coordinates are indexed by proper subsets of $T$, is there a graph $G$ that contains $T$, such that for all subsets $\emptyset\subsetneq S\subsetneq T$, $\pi_S$ equals the value of the min-cut in $G$ separating $S$ from $T\setminus S$? The only known necessary conditions are submodularity and a special class of linear inequalities given by Chaudhuri, Subrahmanyam, Wagner and Zaroliagis.
  Our main result is a new class of linear inequalities concerning laminar families, that generalize all previous ones. Using our new class of inequalities, we can generalize Karger's approximate min-cut counting result to graphs with terminals.</description>

      <title>Multispreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive one-weight codes over a finite field of non-prime order are equivalent to special subspace coverings of the points of projective space, which we call multispreads. The current paper is devoted to the characterization of the parameters of multispreads, which is equivalent to the characterization of the parameters of additive one-weight codes. We characterize these parameters for the case of the prime-square order of the field and make a partial characterization for the prime-cube case and the case of the fourth degree of a prime (including a complete characterization for orders 8, 27, and 16).</description>
