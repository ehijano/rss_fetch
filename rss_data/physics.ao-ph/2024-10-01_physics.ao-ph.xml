      <title>The ARP-GEM1 Global Atmosphere Model. Part I: Description and Speed-up Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of two articles describing the ARP-GEM global atmosphere model version 1 and its evaluation in simulations from 55 km to 6 km resolutions. This article provides a complete description of ARP-GEM1, focusing on its new physical parameterizations and acceleration factors aimed at improving computational efficiency. ARP-GEM1 is approximately 15 times faster than its base model version, ARPEGE-Climat v6.3, while maintaining accurate simulations and enhancing model performance, as shown in Part II.This significant acceleration results from a combination of optimizations, rather than a single factor, with each factor's contribution quantified. Additionally, a detailed decomposition of the model's speedup per component is presented. Streamlining the model reduces computational costs, enhances transparency and portability, and maximizes the benefits of future advanced computing technologies. The results presented here suggest that kilometer-scale global climate simulations should become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>The ARP-GEM1 Global Atmosphere Model. Part II: Multiscale Evaluation up to 6 km</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of a series of two articles focused on the development and evaluation of the ARP-GEM1 global atmosphere model. The first paper introduced the model's new physics and speedup improvements. In this second part, we evaluate ARP-GEM1 through a set of 30-year prescribed sea-surface-temperature simulations at 55, 25, 12.6, and 6.3 km resolutions. The model demonstrates reliability in representing global climate metrics, comparable to the top-performing CMIP6 models, while maintaining high computational efficiency at all resolutions. These simulations further demonstrate the feasibility of O(10)-km climate simulations, and highlight their added value, particularly for capturing phenomena such as cyclones. Ultimately, these exploratory simulations should be considered an intermediate step toward the development and tuning of even higher-resolution, convection-permitting kilometer-scale configurations.</description>

      <title>Inferring Thunderstorm Occurrence from Vertical Profiles of Convection-Permitting Simulations: Physical Insights from a Physical Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thunderstorms have significant social and economic impacts due to heavy precipitation, hail, lightning, and strong winds, necessitating reliable forecasts. Thunderstorm forecasts based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) often rely on single-level surrogate predictors, like convective available potential energy and precipitation rate, derived from vertical profiles of three-dimensional atmospheric variables. In this study, we develop SALAMA 1D, a deep neural network that directly infers the probability of thunderstorm occurrence from vertical profiles of ten atmospheric variables, bypassing single-level predictors. By training the model on convection-permitting NWP forecasts, we allow SALAMA 1D to flexibly identify convective patterns, with the goal of enhancing forecast accuracy. The model's architecture is physically motivated: sparse connections encourage interactions at similar height levels, while a shuffling mechanism prevents the model from learning non-physical patterns tied to the vertical grid. SALAMA 1D is trained over Central Europe with lightning observations as the ground truth. Comparative analysis against a baseline machine learning model that uses single-level predictors shows SALAMA 1D's superior skill across various metrics and lead times of up to at least 11 hours. Moreover, increasing the number of forecasts used to compile the training set improves skill, even when training set size is kept constant. Sensitivity analysis using saliency maps indicates that the model reconstructs environmental lapse rates and rediscovers patterns consistent with established theoretical understandings, such as positive buoyancy, convective inhibition, and ice particle formation near the tropopause, while ruling out thunderstorm occurrence based on the absence of mid-level graupel and cloud cover.</description>

      <title>Unravelling compound risks of hydrological extremes in a changing climate: Typology, methods and futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have witnessed and experienced increasing compound extreme events resulting from simultaneous or sequential occurrence of multiple events in a changing climate. In addition to a growing demand for a clearer explanation of compound risks from a hydrological perspective, there has been a lack of attention paid to socioeconomic factors driving and impacted by these risks. Through a critical review and co-production approaches, we identified four types of compound hydrological events based on autocorrelated, multivariate, and spatiotemporal patterns. A framework to quantify compound risks based on conditional probability is offered, including an argument on the potential use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for identifying emerging trends and patterns for climate change. Insights for practices are discussed, highlighting the implications for disaster risk reduction and knowledge co-production. Our argument centres on the importance of meaningfully considering the socioeconomic contexts in which compound risks may have impacts, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively translate climate science to climate actions.</description>

      <title>Torques on curved atmospheric fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small particles are transported over long distances in the atmosphere, with significant environmental impact. The transport of symmetric particles is well understood, but atmospheric particles, such as curved microplastic fibres or ash particles, are generally asymmetric. This makes the description of their transport properties uncertain. Here, we derive a model for how planar curved fibres settle in quiescent air. The model explains that fluid-inertia torques may align such fibres at oblique angles with gravity as seen in recent laboratory experiments, and shows that inertial alignment is a general and thus important factor for the transport of atmospheric particles.</description>

      <title>CLLMate: A Multimodal LLM for Weather and Climate Events Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting weather and climate events is crucial for making appropriate measures to mitigate environmental hazards and minimize associated losses. Previous research on environmental forecasting focuses on predicting numerical meteorological variables related to closed-set events rather than forecasting open-set events directly, which limits the comprehensiveness of event forecasting. We propose Weather and Climate Event Forecasting (WCEF), a new task that leverages meteorological raster data and textual event data to predict potential weather and climate events. However, due to difficulties in aligning multimodal data and the lack of sufficient supervised datasets, this task is challenging to accomplish. Therefore, we first propose a framework to align historical meteorological data with past weather and climate events using the large language model (LLM). In this framework, we construct a knowledge graph by using LLM to extract information about weather and climate events from a corpus of over 41k highly environment-focused news articles. Subsequently, we mapped these events with meteorological raster data, creating a supervised dataset, which is the largest and most novel for LLM tuning on the WCEF task. Finally, we introduced our aligned models, CLLMate (LLM for climate), a multimodal LLM to forecast weather and climate events using meteorological raster data. In evaluating CLLMate, we conducted extensive experiments. The results indicate that CLLMate surpasses both the baselines and other multimodal LLMs, showcasing the potential of utilizing LLM to align weather and climate events with meteorological data and highlighting the promising future for research on the WCEF task.</description>

      <title>An analysis on OpenMetBuoy-v2021 drifter in-situ data and Lagrangian trajectory simulations in the Agulhas Current System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to perform a sensitivity analysis of Lagrangian trajectory models, Lagrangian trajectory simulations have been compared to six OpenMetBuoy-v2021 drifter trajectories in the Agulhas Current System (Jan-Mar 2023). Three different Lagrangian trajectory simulations have been assessed: (1) two offline Lagrangian tracking tools, OpenDrift and Parcels, (2) three Eulerian ocean surface current products, HYCOM, Mercator and Globcurrent, and (3) the addition of wind and/or wave forcing parameterizations. The latter has also been evaluated by strong ocean current, high wind speed and Stokes drift regimes.
  Firstly, using the same time stepping scheme and linear interpolation methods, the different Lagrangian simulators OpenDrift and Parcels, performed identically. Secondly, the Globcurrent product showed the highest mean skill of the three ocean current products, although it underestimated the speed for strong ocean currents due to its spatial resolution. The HYCOM and Mercator model simulations showed, respectively, 40\% and 15\% lower skill than the Globcurrent simulations. Finally, the addition of the Stokes drift and a wind drift factor (WDF), improved the Lagrangian simulation performance in skill and speed, especially in high wind (&gt;10 m/s) and/or Stokes drift regimes (&gt;0.15 m/s). The optimal WDF for the OpenMetBuoy-v2021 is found to be ~1.8\% and ~2.3\% for simulations including and excluding Stokes drift forcing respectively. To further improve the incorporation of Stokes drift and direct wind drag on the trajectory simulations, a more physically based solution is advised as there are still numerous wind and wave related processes that remain unresolved, like wave-current interactions and vertical shear.
  To statistically strengthen the conclusions from this research, incorporating additional observed drifter trajectories would be highly favourable.</description>

      <title>SFY -- A lightweight, high-frequency and phase-resolving wave-buoy for coastal waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small lightweight wave buoys, SFYs, designed to operate near the coast, have been developed. The buoys are designed to record and transmit the full time series of surface acceleration at $52$ Hz. The buoy uses the cellular network to transfer data and position (up to $80$ km from the base station). This reduces costs and increases band-width. The low cost and low weight permits the buoys to be deployed easily, and in arrays in areas where satellite and wave models struggle to resolve wave and current interaction. The buoys are tested in a wave-flume, the open water and in the breaking waves of the surf. The conditions range from calm to significant wave heights exceeding $7$ m and crashing breakers with accelerations exceeding $10$ g. The high sample rate captures the impulse of breaking waves, and allows them to be studied in detail. Breaking waves are measured and quantified in the open water. We measure breaking waves in the surf and recover the trajectory of waves breaking in the field to a higher degree than previously done. The time series of surface elevation, and accurate positioning, permits the signal of adjacent buoys to be correlated in a coherent phase-resolved way. Finally, we offer an explanation and solution for the ubiquitous low-frequency noise in IMU-based buoys and discuss necessary sampling and design to measure in areas of breaking waves.</description>
