      <title>VAR-SLAM: Visual Adaptive and Robust SLAM for Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging, as several existing methods rely on semantic filtering that only handles known object classes, or use fixed robust kernels that cannot adapt to unknown moving objects, leading to degraded accuracy when they appear in the scene. We present VAR-SLAM (Visual Adaptive and Robust SLAM), an ORB-SLAM3-based system that combines a lightweight semantic keypoint filter to deal with known moving objects, with Barron's adaptive robust loss to handle unknown ones. The shape parameter of the robust kernel is estimated online from residuals, allowing the system to automatically adjust between Gaussian and heavy-tailed behavior. We evaluate VAR-SLAM on the TUM RGB-D, Bonn RGB-D Dynamic, and OpenLORIS datasets, which include both known and unknown moving objects. Results show improved trajectory accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 25% lower ATE RMSE than NGD-SLAM on challenging sequences, while maintaining performance at 27 FPS on average.</description>

      <title>DeGrip: A Compact Cable-driven Robotic Gripper for Desktop Disassembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent robotic disassembly of end-of-life (EOL) products has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. While machine learning techniques have shown promise, the lack of specialized hardware limits their application in real-world scenarios. We introduce DeGrip, a customized gripper designed for the disassembly of EOL computer desktops. DeGrip provides three degrees of freedom (DOF), enabling arbitrary configurations within the disassembly environment when mounted on a robotic manipulator. It employs a cable-driven transmission mechanism that reduces its overall size and enables operation in confined spaces. The wrist is designed to decouple the actuation of wrist and jaw joints. We also developed an EOL desktop disassembly environment in Isaac Sim to evaluate the effectiveness of DeGrip. The tasks were designed to demonstrate its ability to operate in confined spaces and disassemble components in arbitrary configurations. The evaluation results confirm the capability of DeGrip for EOL desktop disassembly.</description>

      <title>Cosmos-Surg-dVRK: World Foundation Model-based Automated Online Evaluation of Surgical Robot Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of surgical robots and vision-language-action models has accelerated the development of autonomous surgical policies and efficient assessment strategies. However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution. World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation, with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA 2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential for more complex surgical procedures.</description>

      <title>NEBULA: Do We Evaluate Vision-Language-Action Agents Correctly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16263v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we introduce NEBULA, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained capability tests for precise skill diagnosis with systematic stress tests that measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Do What You Say: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models via Runtime Reasoning-Action Alignment Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

      <title>SPOT: Sensing-augmented Trajectory Planning via Obstacle Threat Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UAVs equipped with a single depth camera encounter significant challenges in dynamic obstacle avoidance due to limited field of view and inevitable blind spots. While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT (Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed) and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.</description>

      <title>Manual2Skill++: Connector-Aware General Robotic Assembly from Instruction Manuals via Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly hinges on reliably forming connections between parts; yet most robotic approaches plan assembly sequences and part poses while treating connectors as an afterthought. Connections represent the critical "last mile" of assembly execution, while task planning may sequence operations and motion plan may position parts, the precise establishment of physical connections ultimately determines assembly success or failure. In this paper, we consider connections as first-class primitives in assembly representation, including connector types, specifications, quantities, and placement locations. Drawing inspiration from how humans learn assembly tasks through step-by-step instruction manuals, we present Manual2Skill++, a vision-language framework that automatically extracts structured connection information from assembly manuals. We encode assembly tasks as hierarchical graphs where nodes represent parts and sub-assemblies, and edges explicitly model connection relationships between components. A large-scale vision-language model parses symbolic diagrams and annotations in manuals to instantiate these graphs, leveraging the rich connection knowledge embedded in human-designed instructions. We curate a dataset containing over 20 assembly tasks with diverse connector types to validate our representation extraction approach, and evaluate the complete task understanding-to-execution pipeline across four complex assembly scenarios in simulation, spanning furniture, toys, and manufacturing components with real-world correspondence.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimize Edge Robotics: A Fast Integrated Perception-Motion-Communication Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge robotics involves frequent exchanges of large-volume multi-modal data. Existing methods ignore the interdependency between robotic functionalities and communication conditions, leading to excessive communication overhead. This paper revolutionizes edge robotics systems through integrated perception, motion, and communication (IPMC). As such, robots can dynamically adapt their communication strategies (i.e., compression ratio, transmission frequency, transmit power) by leveraging the knowledge of robotic perception and motion dynamics, thus reducing the need for excessive sensor data uploads. Furthermore, by leveraging the learning to optimize (LTO) paradigm, an imitation learning neural network is designed and implemented, which reduces the computational complexity by over 10x compared to state-of-the art optimization solvers. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IPMC and the real-time execution capability of LTO.</description>

      <title>What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? A Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing use of large language models and conversational interfaces in human-robot interaction, robots' ability to answer user questions is more important than ever. We therefore introduce a dataset of 1,893 user questions for household robots, collected from 100 participants and organized into 12 categories and 70 subcategories. Most work in explainable robotics focuses on why-questions. In contrast, our dataset provides a wide variety of questions, from questions about simple execution details to questions about how the robot would act in hypothetical scenarios -- thus giving roboticists valuable insights into what questions their robot needs to be able to answer. To collect the dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots performing varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what questions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the final dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution details (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments (11.3%). Although questions about how robots would handle potentially difficult scenarios and ensure correct behavior are less frequent, users rank them as the most important for robots to be able to answer. Moreover, we find that users who identify as novices in robotics ask different questions than more experienced users. Novices are more likely to inquire about simple facts, such as what the robot did or the current state of the environment. As robots enter environments shared with humans and language becomes central to giving instructions and interaction, this dataset provides a valuable foundation for (i) identifying the information robots need to log and expose to conversational interfaces, (ii) benchmarking question-answering modules, and (iii) designing explanation strategies that align with user expectations.</description>

      <title>Advancing Off-Road Autonomous Driving: The Large-Scale ORAD-3D Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in off-road autonomous driving research lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest dataset specifically curated for off-road autonomous driving. ORAD-3D covers a wide spectrum of terrains, including woodlands, farmlands, grasslands, riversides, gravel roads, cement roads, and rural areas, while capturing diverse environmental variations across weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, and snowy) and illumination levels (bright daylight, daytime, twilight, and nighttime). Building upon this dataset, we establish a comprehensive suite of benchmark evaluations spanning five fundamental tasks: 2D free-space detection, 3D occupancy prediction, rough GPS-guided path planning, vision-language model-driven autonomous driving, and world model for off-road environments. Together, the dataset and benchmarks provide a unified and robust resource for advancing perception and planning in challenging off-road scenarios. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/ORAD-3D.</description>

      <title>A Novel Gripper with Semi-Peaucellier Linkage and Idle-Stroke Mechanism for Linear Pinching and Self-Adaptive Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robotic gripper, named as the SPD gripper. It features a palm and two mechanically identical and symmetrically arranged fingers, which can be driven independently or by a single motor. The fingertips of the fingers follow a linear motion trajectory, facilitating the grasping of objects of various sizes on a tabletop without the need to adjust the overall height of the gripper. Traditional industrial grippers with parallel gripping capabilities often exhibit an arcuate motion at the fingertips, requiring the entire robotic arm to adjust its height to avoid collisions with the tabletop. The SPD gripper, with its linear parallel gripping mechanism, effectively addresses this issue. Furthermore, the SPD gripper possesses adaptive capabilities, accommodating objects of different shapes and sizes. This paper presents the design philosophy, fundamental composition principles, and optimization analysis theory of the SPD gripper. Based on the design theory, a robotic gripper prototype was developed and tested. The experimental results demonstrate that the robotic gripper successfully achieves linear parallel gripping functionality and exhibits good adaptability. In the context of the ongoing development of embodied intelligence technologies, this robotic gripper can assist various robots in achieving effective grasping, laying a solid foundation for collecting data to enhance deep learning training.</description>

      <title>DIV-Nav: Open-Vocabulary Spatial Relationships for Multi-Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in open-vocabulary semantic mapping and object navigation have enabled robots to perform an informed search of their environment for an arbitrary object. However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i) Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original, complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX.

      <title>Semi-Peaucellier Linkage and Differential Mechanism for Linear Pinching and Self-Adaptive Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the SP-Diff parallel gripper system, addressing the limited adaptability of conventional end-effectors in intelligent industrial automation. The proposed design employs an innovative differential linkage mechanism with a modular symmetric dual-finger configuration to achieve linear-parallel grasping. By integrating a planetary gear transmission, the system enables synchronized linear motion and independent finger pose adjustment while maintaining structural rigidity, reducing Z-axis recalibration requirements by 30% compared to arc-trajectory grippers. The compact palm architecture incorporates a kinematically optimized parallelogram linkage and Differential mechanism, demonstrating adaptive grasping capabilities for diverse industrial workpieces and deformable objects such as citrus fruits. Future-ready interfaces are embedded for potential force/vision sensor integration to facilitate multimodal data acquisition (e.g., trajectory planning and object deformation) in digital twin frameworks. Designed as a flexible manufacturing solution, SP-Diff advances robotic end-effector intelligence through its adaptive architecture, showing promising applications in collaborative robotics, logistics automation, and specialized operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>MoS-VLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model with One-Shot Skill Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained on large robot datasets promise general-purpose, robust control across diverse domains and embodiments. However, existing approaches often fail out-of-the-box when deployed in novel environments, embodiments, or tasks. We introduce Mixture of Skills VLA (MoS-VLA), a framework that represents robot manipulation policies as linear combinations of a finite set of learned basis functions. During pretraining, MoS-VLA jointly learns these basis functions across datasets from the Open X-Embodiment project, producing a structured skill space. At test time, adapting to a new task requires only a single expert demonstration. The corresponding skill representation is then inferred via a lightweight convex optimization problem that minimizes the L1 action error, without requiring gradient updates. This gradient-free adaptation incurs minimal overhead while enabling rapid instantiation of new skills. Empirically, MoS-VLA achieves lower action-prediction error on five out of five unseen datasets and succeeds in both simulation and real-robot tasks where a pretrained VLA model fails outright.

      <title>First Responders' Perceptions of Semantic Information for Situational Awareness in Robot-Assisted Emergency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates First Responders' (FRs) attitudes toward the use of semantic information and Situational Awareness (SA) in robotic systems during emergency operations. A structured questionnaire was administered to 22 FRs across eight countries, capturing their demographic profiles, general attitudes toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Results show that most FRs expressed positive attitudes toward robots, and rated the usefulness of semantic information for building SA at an average of 3.6 out of 5. Semantic information was also valued for its role in predicting unforeseen emergencies (mean 3.9). Participants reported requiring an average of 74.6\% accuracy to trust semantic outputs and 67.8\% for them to be considered useful, revealing a willingness to use imperfect but informative AI support tools.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study offers novel insights by being one of the first to directly survey FRs on semantic-based SA in a cross-national context. It reveals the types of semantic information most valued in the field, such as object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context-and connects these preferences to the respondents' roles, experience, and education levels. The findings also expose a critical gap between lab-based robotics capabilities and the realities of field deployment, highlighting the need for more meaningful collaboration between FRs and robotics researchers. These insights contribute to the development of more user-aligned and situationally aware robotic systems for emergency response.</description>

      <title>Towards Active Excitation-Based Dynamic Inertia Identification in Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how excitation design influences the identification of the inertia properties of rigid nano- and micro-satellites. We simulate nonlinear attitude dynamics with reaction-wheel coupling, actuator limits, and external disturbances, and excite the system using eight torque profiles of varying spectral richness. Two estimators are compared, a batch Least Squares method and an Extended Kalman Filter, across three satellite configurations and time-varying inertia scenarios. Results show that excitation frequency content and estimator assumptions jointly determine estimation accuracy and robustness, offering practical guidance for in-orbit adaptive inertia identification by outlining the conditions under which each method performs best. The code is provided as open-source .</description>

      <title>Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Legged Robot State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation is crucial for legged robots as it directly affects control performance and locomotion stability. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter to improve proprioceptive state estimation for legged robots. The proposed method adaptively adjusts the noise level of the contact foot model based on online covariance estimation, leading to improved state estimation under varying contact conditions. It effectively handles small slips that traditional slip rejection fails to address, as overly sensitive slip rejection settings risk causing filter divergence. Our approach employs a contact detection algorithm instead of contact sensors, reducing the reliance on additional hardware. The proposed method is validated through real-world experiments on the quadruped robot LeoQuad, demonstrating enhanced state estimation performance in dynamic locomotion scenarios.</description>

      <title>T3 Planner: A Self-Correcting LLM Framework for Robotic Motion Planning with Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3 Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

      <title>A Preliminary Exploration of the Differences and Conjunction of Traditional PNT and Brain-inspired PNT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing universal Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) is our enduring goal. Today's complex environments demand PNT that is more resilient, energy-efficient and cognitively capable. This paper asks how we can endow unmanned systems with brain-inspired spatial cognition navigation while exploiting the high precision of machine PNT to advance universal PNT. We provide a new perspective and roadmap for shifting PNT from "tool-oriented" to "cognition-driven". Contributions: (1) multi-level dissection of differences among traditional PNT, biological brain PNT and brain-inspired PNT; (2) a four-layer (observation-capability-decision-hardware) fusion framework that unites numerical precision and brain-inspired intelligence; (3) forward-looking recommendations for future development of brain-inspired PNT.</description>

      <title>C-Free-Uniform: A Map-Conditioned Trajectory Sampler for Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory sampling is a key component of sampling-based control mechanisms. Trajectory samplers rely on control input samplers, which generate control inputs u from a distribution p(u | x) where x is the current state. We introduce the notion of Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform for short) which has two key features: (i) it generates a control input distribution so as to uniformly sample the free configuration space, and (ii) in contrast to previously introduced trajectory sampling mechanisms where the distribution p(u | x) is independent of the environment, C-Free-Uniform is explicitly conditioned on the current local map. Next, we integrate this sampler into a new Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller, CFU-MPPI. Experiments show that CFU-MPPI outperforms existing methods in terms of success rate in challenging navigation tasks in cluttered polygonal environments while requiring a much smaller sampling budget.</description>

      <title>RAPID Hand Prototype: Design of an Affordable, Fully-Actuated Biomimetic Hand for Dexterous Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16931v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the scarcity of affordable, fully-actuated five-fingered hands for dexterous teleoperation, which is crucial for collecting large-scale real-robot data within the "Learning from Demonstrations" paradigm. We introduce the prototype version of the RAPID Hand, the first low-cost, 20-degree-of-actuation (DoA) dexterous hand that integrates a novel anthropomorphic actuation and transmission scheme with an optimized motor layout and structural design to enhance dexterity. Specifically, the RAPID Hand features a universal phalangeal transmission scheme for the non-thumb fingers and an omnidirectional thumb actuation mechanism. Prioritizing affordability, the hand employs 3D-printed parts combined with custom gears for easier replacement and repair. We assess the RAPID Hand's performance through quantitative metrics and qualitative testing in a dexterous teleoperation system, which is evaluated on three challenging tasks: multi-finger retrieval, ladle handling, and human-like piano playing. The results indicate that the RAPID Hand's fully actuated 20-DoF design holds significant promise for dexterous teleoperation.</description>

      <title>DINO-CVA: A Multimodal Goal-Conditioned Vision-to-Action Model for Autonomous Catheter Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac catheterization remains a cornerstone of minimally invasive interventions, yet it continues to rely heavily on manual operation. Despite advances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader in nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent autonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation exposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased therapies.</description>

      <title>Learning to Design Soft Hands using Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotic hands promise to provide compliant and safe interaction with objects and environments. However, designing soft hands to be both compliant and functional across diverse use cases remains challenging. Although co-design of hardware and control better couples morphology to behavior, the resulting search space is high-dimensional, and even simulation-based evaluation is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Entropy Method with Reward Model (CEM-RM) framework that efficiently optimizes tendon-driven soft robotic hands based on teleoperation control policy, reducing design evaluations by more than half compared to pure optimization while learning a distribution of optimized hand designs from pre-collected teleoperation data. We derive a design space for a soft robotic hand composed of flexural soft fingers and implement parallelized training in simulation. The optimized hands are then 3D-printed and deployed in the real world using both teleoperation data and real-time teleoperation. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our optimized design significantly outperforms baseline hands in grasping success rates across a diverse set of challenging objects.</description>

      <title>Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied Manipulation: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models extend vision-language models to embodied control by mapping natural-language instructions and visual observations to robot actions. Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture, perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies, summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing efficient embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Real-Time Planning for Multi-UAV Cooperative Manipulation via Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches for transporting and manipulating cable-suspended loads using multiple UAVs along reference trajectories typically rely on either centralized control architectures or reliable inter-agent communication. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based method for decentralized kinodynamic planning that operates effectively under partial observability and without inter-agent communication. Our method leverages imitation learning to train a decentralized student policy for each UAV by imitating a centralized kinodynamic motion planner with access to privileged global observations. The student policy generates smooth trajectories using physics-informed neural networks that respect the derivative relationships in motion. During training, the student policies utilize the full trajectory generated by the teacher policy, leading to improved sample efficiency. Moreover, each student policy can be trained in under two hours on a standard laptop. We validate our method in both simulation and real-world environments to follow an agile reference trajectory, demonstrating performance comparable to that of centralized approaches.</description>

      <title>DiffVLA++: Bridging Cognitive Reasoning and End-to-End Driving through Metric-Guided Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17148v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.</description>

      <title>OmniVIC: A Self-Improving Variable Impedance Controller with Vision-Language In-Context Learning for Safe Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OmniVIC, a universal variable impedance controller (VIC) enhanced by a vision language model (VLM), which improves safety and adaptation in any contact-rich robotic manipulation task to enhance safe physical interaction. Traditional VIC have shown advantages when the robot physically interacts with the environment, but lack generalization in unseen, complex, and unstructured safe interactions in universal task scenarios involving contact or uncertainty. To this end, the proposed OmniVIC interprets task context derived reasoning from images and natural language and generates adaptive impedance parameters for a VIC controller. Specifically, the core of OmniVIC is a self-improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and in-context learning (ICL), where RAG retrieves relevant prior experiences from a structured memory bank to inform the controller about similar past tasks, and ICL leverages these retrieved examples and the prompt of current task to query the VLM for generating context-aware and adaptive impedance parameters for the current manipulation scenario. Therefore, a self-improved RAG and ICL guarantee OmniVIC works in universal task scenarios. The impedance parameter regulation is further informed by real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real-world robotic tasks, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. OmniVIC takes a step towards bridging high-level semantic reasoning and low-level compliant control, enabling safer and more generalizable manipulation. Overall, the average success rate increases from 27% (baseline) to 61.4% (OmniVIC).</description>

      <title>SimpleVSF: VLM-Scoring Fusion for Trajectory Prediction of End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving robust and intelligent driving policies. However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of an Integrated System for Visible Light Communication and Positioning Using an Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras, featuring high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, offer visual sensing capabilities comparable to conventional image sensors while capturing fast-moving objects and handling scenes with extreme lighting contrasts such as tunnel exits. Leveraging these properties, this study proposes a novel self-localization system that integrates visible light communication (VLC) and visible light positioning (VLP) within a single event camera. The system enables a vehicle to estimate its position even in GPS-denied environments, such as tunnels, by using VLC to obtain coordinate information from LED transmitters and VLP to estimate the distance to each transmitter.
  Multiple LEDs are installed on the transmitter side, each assigned a unique pilot sequence based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. The event camera identifies individual LEDs within its field of view by correlating the received signal with these codes, allowing clear separation and recognition of each light source. This mechanism enables simultaneous high-capacity MISO (multi-input single-output) communication through VLC and precise distance estimation via phase-only correlation (POC) between multiple LED pairs.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first vehicle-mounted system to achieve simultaneous VLC and VLP functionalities using a single event camera. Field experiments were conducted by mounting the system on a vehicle traveling at 30 km/h (8.3 m/s). The results demonstrated robust real-world performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of distance estimation within 0.75 m for ranges up to 100 m and a bit error rate (BER) below 0.01 across the same range.</description>

      <title>Pole-Image: A Self-Supervised Pole-Anchored Descriptor for Long-Term LiDAR Localization and Map Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term autonomy for mobile robots requires both robust self-localization and reliable map maintenance. Conventional landmark-based methods face a fundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low distinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult stable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the challenge of descriptively identifying a unique "signature" (local point cloud) by leveraging a detectable, high-precision "anchor" (like a pole). To solve this, we propose a novel canonical representation, "Pole-Image," as a hybrid method that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding 3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding environment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image with the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's nature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the "relative geometry" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The key advantage of pole landmarks is that "detection" is extremely easy. This ease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the automatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive pairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes "Contrastive Learning (CL)" applicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly discriminative descriptor. The contributions are twofold: 1) The descriptor overcomes perceptual aliasing, enabling robust self-localization. 2) The high-precision encoding enables high-sensitivity change detection, contributing to map maintenance.</description>

      <title>An adaptive hierarchical control framework for quadrupedal robots in planetary exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary exploration missions require robots capable of navigating extreme and unknown environments. While wheeled rovers have dominated past missions, their mobility is limited to traversable surfaces. Legged robots, especially quadrupeds, can overcome these limitations by handling uneven, obstacle-rich, and deformable terrains. However, deploying such robots in unknown conditions is challenging due to the need for environment-specific control, which is infeasible when terrain and robot parameters are uncertain. This work presents a modular control framework that combines model-based dynamic control with online model adaptation and adaptive footstep planning to address uncertainties in both robot and terrain properties. The framework includes state estimation for quadrupeds with and without contact sensing, supports runtime reconfiguration, and is integrated into ROS 2 with open-source availability. Its performance was validated on two quadruped platforms, multiple hardware architectures, and in a volcano field test, where the robot walked over 700 m.</description>

      <title>High-Level Multi-Robot Trajectory Planning And Spurious Behavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable execution of high-level missions in multi-robot systems with heterogeneous agents, requires robust methods for detecting spurious behaviors. In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN) paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi- mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs better than simpler representations.</description>

      <title>Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with physics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of floating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models ignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is not only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input independence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base inherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this includes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational inertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of floating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that satisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN), we train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that minimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we collected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these experiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly competitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing greater physical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Implicit State Estimation via Video Replanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based representations have gained prominence in planning and decision-making due to their ability to encode rich spatiotemporal dynamics and geometric relationships. These representations enable flexible and generalizable solutions for complex tasks such as object manipulation and navigation. However, existing video planning frameworks often struggle to adapt to failures at interaction time due to their inability to reason about uncertainties in partially observed environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that integrates interaction-time data into the planning process. Our approach updates model parameters online and filters out previously failed plans during generation. This enables implicit state estimation, allowing the system to adapt dynamically without explicitly modeling unknown state variables. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on a new simulated manipulation benchmark, demonstrating its ability to improve replanning performance and advance the field of video-based decision-making.</description>

      <title>DDBot: Differentiable Physics-based Digging Robot for Unknown Granular Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17335v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties, and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil.
  Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent.
  Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.</description>

      <title>Interactive Force-Impedance Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human collaboration with robots requires flexible role adaptation, enabling robot to switch between active leader and passive follower. Effective role switching depends on accurately estimating human intention, which is typically achieved through external force analysis, nominal robot dynamics, or data-driven approaches. However, these methods are primarily effective in contact-sparse environments. When robots under hybrid or unified force-impedance control physically interact with active humans or non-passive environments, the robotic system may lose passivity and thus compromise safety. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the unified Interactive Force-Impedance Control (IFIC) framework that adapts to the interaction power flow, ensuring effortless and safe interaction in contact-rich environments. The proposed control architecture is formulated within a port-Hamiltonian framework, incorporating both interaction and task control ports, through which system passivity is guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Bridging Embodiment Gaps: Deploying Vision-Language-Action Models on Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered, unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology that integrates trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) with an energy-efficient robotic arm for intelligent waste classification and sorting. By utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) enhanced through transfer learning with MobileNetV2, the system accurately classifies waste into six categories: plastic, glass, metal, paper, cardboard, and trash. The model achieved a high training accuracy of 99.8% and a validation accuracy of 80.5%, demonstrating strong learning and generalization. A robotic arm simulator is implemented to perform virtual sorting, calculating the energy cost for each action using Euclidean distance to ensure optimal and efficient movement. The framework incorporates key elements of trustworthy AI, such as transparency, robustness, fairness, and safety, making it a reliable and scalable solution for smart waste management systems in urban settings.</description>

      <title>From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Input-Output Linearization via Dynamic Switching Between Melds of Output Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a systematic framework for switching between different sets of outputs for the control of nonlinear systems via feedback linearization. We introduce the concept of a meld to formally define a valid, feedback-linearizable subset of outputs that can be selected from a larger deck of possible outputs. The main contribution is a formal proof establishing that under suitable dwell-time and compatibility conditions, it is possible to switch between different melds while guaranteeing the uniform boundedness of the system state. We further show that the error dynamics of the active outputs remain exponentially stable within each switching interval and that outputs common to consecutive melds are tracked seamlessly through transitions. The proposed theory is valid for any feedback linearizable nonlinear system, such as, e.g., robots, aerial and terrestrial vehicles, etc.. We demonstrate it on a simple numerical simulation of a robotic manipulator.</description>

      <title>HumanMPC - Safe and Efficient MAV Navigation among Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe and efficient robotic navigation among humans is essential for integrating robots into everyday environments. Most existing approaches focus on simplified 2D crowd navigation and fail to account for the full complexity of human body dynamics beyond root motion. We present HumanMPC, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for 3D Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) navigation among humans that combines theoretical safety guarantees with data-driven models for realistic human motion forecasting. Our approach introduces a novel twist to reachability-based safety formulation that constrains only the initial control input for safety while modeling its effects over the entire planning horizon, enabling safe yet efficient navigation. We validate HumanMPC in both simulated experiments using real human trajectories and in the real-world, demonstrating its effectiveness across tasks ranging from goal-directed navigation to visual servoing for human tracking. While we apply our method to MAVs in this work, it is generic and can be adapted by other platforms. Our results show that the method ensures safety without excessive conservatism and outperforms baseline approaches in both efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <title>Distributed Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Optimization for Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Intent-Driven LLM Ensemble Planning for Flexible Multi-Robot Disassembly: Demonstration on EV Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.</description>

      <title>Learned Inertial Odometry for Cycling Based on Mixture of Experts Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of bike sharing and the increasing diversity of cycling applications, accurate bicycle localization has become essential. traditional GNSS-based methods suffer from multipath effects, while existing inertial navigation approaches rely on precise modeling and show limited robustness. Tight Learned Inertial Odometry (TLIO) achieves low position drift by combining raw IMU data with predicted displacements by neural networks, but its high computational cost restricts deployment on mobile devices. To overcome this, we extend TLIO to bicycle localization and introduce an improved Mixture-of Experts (MoE) model that reduces both training and inference costs. Experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLIO framework, our method achieves comparable accuracy while reducing parameters by 64.7% and computational cost by 81.8%.</description>

      <title>RESample: A Robust Data Augmentation Framework via Exploratory Sampling for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.</description>

      <title>Botany-Bot: Digital Twin Monitoring of Occluded and Underleaf Plant Structures with Gaussian Splats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial plant phenotyping systems using fixed cameras cannot perceive many plant details due to leaf occlusion. In this paper, we present Botany-Bot, a system for building detailed "annotated digital twins" of living plants using two stereo cameras, a digital turntable inside a lightbox, an industrial robot arm, and 3D segmentated Gaussian Splat models. We also present robot algorithms for manipulating leaves to take high-resolution indexable images of occluded details such as stem buds and the underside/topside of leaves. Results from experiments suggest that Botany-Bot can segment leaves with 90.8% accuracy, detect leaves with 86.2% accuracy, lift/push leaves with 77.9% accuracy, and take detailed overside/underside images with 77.3% accuracy. Code, videos, and datasets are available at https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/Botany-Bot/.</description>

      <title>SoftMimic: Learning Compliant Whole-body Control from Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SoftMimic, a framework for learning compliant whole-body control policies for humanoid robots from example motions. Imitating human motions with reinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but existing methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects deviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when the robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.</description>

      <title>Robobench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models as Embodied Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System 1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects, and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework, MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in https://robo-bench.github.io.</description>

      <title>InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans, and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection, highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city wide deployments.</description>

Abstract: The Aria Gen 2 Pilot Dataset (A2PD) is an egocentric multimodal open dataset captured using the state-of-the-art Aria Gen 2 glasses. To facilitate timely access, A2PD is released incrementally with ongoing dataset enhancements. The initial release features Dia'ane, our primary subject, who records her daily activities alongside friends, each equipped with Aria Gen 2 glasses. It encompasses five primary scenarios: cleaning, cooking, eating, playing, and outdoor walking. In each of the scenarios, we provide comprehensive raw sensor data and output data from various machine perception algorithms. These data illustrate the device's ability to perceive the wearer, the surrounding environment, and interactions between the wearer and the environment, while maintaining robust performance across diverse users and conditions. The A2PD is publicly available at projectaria.com, with open-source tools and usage examples provided in Project Aria Tools.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Coordination in Ad Hoc Teams with Generalized Policy Improvement and Difference Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world multi-agent systems may require ad hoc teaming, where an agent must coordinate with other previously unseen teammates to solve a task in a zero-shot manner. Prior work often either selects a pretrained policy based on an inferred model of the new teammates or pretrains a single policy that is robust to potential teammates. Instead, we propose to leverage all pretrained policies in a zero-shot transfer setting. We formalize this problem as an ad hoc multi-agent Markov decision process and present a solution that uses two key ideas, generalized policy improvement and difference rewards, for efficient and effective knowledge transfer between different teams. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm, Generalized Policy improvement for Ad hoc Teaming (GPAT), successfully enables zero-shot transfer to new teams in three simulated environments: cooperative foraging, predator-prey, and Overcooked. We also demonstrate our algorithm in a real-world multi-robot setting.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.</description>

      <title>RefAtomNet++: Advancing Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition using Semantic Retrieval based Multi-Trajectory Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises &gt;2.9 million frames and &gt;75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.</description>

      <title>NavQ: Learning a Q-Model for Foresighted Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning to Fly using Efficient Semantic Segmentation and Metric Depth Estimation for Low-Cost Autonomous UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance, scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of 14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments, demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.</description>

      <title>Structured Interfaces for Automated Reasoning with 3D Scene Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially reducing the token count of the scene graph content.

      <title>End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act), which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>An RGB-D Image Dataset for Lychee Detection and Maturity Classification for Robotic Harvesting</title>

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images, consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly available for academic</description>

      <title>DiRAC - Distributed Robot Awareness and Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DiRAC is a scalable, distributed framework designed to enable efficient task assignment and path planning in very large robotic swarms. It introduces a novel zone-partitioned architecture with dynamically elected leaders and a tick-synchronized consensus protocol that yields strong consistency and deterministic outcomes. For path planning, DiRAC uses a novel algorithm, a force-based decentralized planner for real-time collision resolution. Validated within ROS 2 middleware through preliminary simulation, DiRAC demonstrates architectural scalability and modular efficiency in simulated warehouse environments, laying the groundwork for real-world deployment in large-scale industrial and logistics domains.</description>

      <title>Safe Payload Transfer with Ship-Mounted Cranes: A Robust Model Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe real-time control of ship-mounted cranes in unstructured transportation environments requires handling multiple safety constraints while maintaining effective payload transfer performance. Unlike traditional crane systems, ship-mounted cranes are consistently subjected to significant external disturbances affecting underactuated crane dynamics due to the ship's dynamic motion response to harsh sea conditions, which can lead to robustness issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and safe model predictive control (MPC) framework and demonstrate it on a 5-DOF crane system, where a Stewart platform simulates the external disturbances that ocean surface motions would have on the supporting ship. The crane payload transfer operation must avoid obstacles and accurately place the payload within a designated target area. We use a robust zero-order control barrier function (R-ZOCBF)-based safety constraint in the nonlinear MPC to ensure safe payload positioning, while time-varying bounding boxes are utilized for collision avoidance. We introduce a new optimization-based online robustness parameter adaptation scheme to reduce the conservativeness of R-ZOCBFs. Experimental trials on a crane prototype demonstrate the overall performance of our safe control approach under significant perturbing motions of the crane base. While our focus is on crane-facilitated transfer, the methods more generally apply to safe robotically-assisted parts mating and parts insertion.</description>

      <title>M2H: Multi-Task Learning with Efficient Window-Based Cross-Task Attention for Monocular Spatial Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth, edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments. Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality in spatial perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention-Guided Search for Dense Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners. To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed. In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent coordination problems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control of Muscle Force Sharing During Pathological Gait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides, possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Lagrangian Methods in Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems, constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at https://github.com/lindsayspoor/Lagrangian_SafeRL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensory substitution enables biological systems to perceive stimuli typically obtained by another organ, which is inspirational for physical agents. Multi-modal perception of intrinsic and extrinsic interactions is critical in building an intelligent robot that learns. This study presents a Vision-based See-Through Perception (VBSeeThruP) architecture that simultaneously perceives multiple intrinsic and extrinsic modalities via a single visual input in a markerless way, all packed within a soft robotic finger using the Soft Polyhedral Network design. It is generally applicable to miniature vision systems placed underneath deformable networks with a see-through design, capturing real-time images of the network's physical interactions induced by contact-based events overlayed on top of the visual scene of the external environment, as demonstrated in the ablation study. We present the VBSeeThruP's capability for learning reactive grasping without using external cameras or dedicated force and torque sensors on the fingertips. Using the inpainted scene and the deformation mask, we further demonstrate the multi-modal performance of the VBSeeThruP architecture to simultaneously achieve various perceptions, including but not limited to scene inpainting, object detection, depth sensing, scene segmentation, masked deformation tracking, 6D force/torque sensing, and contact event detection, all within a single sensory input from the in-finger vision markerlessly.</description>

      <title>Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Behavior-Based Cooperative Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of behavior-based cooperative navigation of mobile robots using safe multi-agent reinforcement learning~(MARL). Our work is the first to focus on cooperative navigation without individual reference targets for the robots, using a single target for the formation's centroid. This eliminates the complexities involved in having several path planners to control a team of robots. To ensure safety, our MARL framework uses model predictive control (MPC) to prevent actions that could lead to collisions during training and execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulation and on real robots, achieving safe behavior-based cooperative navigation without using individual reference targets, with zero collisions, and faster target reaching compared to baselines. Finally, we study the impact of MPC safety filters on the learning process, revealing that we achieve faster convergence during training and we show that our approach can be safely deployed on real robots, even during early stages of the training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04857v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference-aligned robot navigation in human environments is typically achieved through learning-based approaches, utilizing user feedback or demonstrations for personalization. However, personal preferences are subject to change and might even be context-dependent. Yet traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches with static reward functions often fall short in adapting to evolving user preferences, inevitably reflecting demonstrations once training is completed. This paper introduces a structured framework that combines demonstration-based learning with multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). To ensure real-world applicability, our approach allows for dynamic adaptation of the robot navigation policy to changing user preferences without retraining. It fluently modulates the amount of demonstration data reflection and other preference-related objectives. Through rigorous evaluations, including a baseline comparison and sim-to-real transfer on two robots, we demonstrate our framework's capability to adapt to user preferences accurately while achieving high navigational performance in terms of collision avoidance and goal pursuance.</description>

      <title>Learn2Decompose: Learning Problem Decomposition for Efficient Sequential Multi-object Manipulation Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06843v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient task and motion replanning approach for sequential multi-object manipulation in dynamic environments. Conventional Task And Motion Planning (TAMP) solvers experience an exponential increase in planning time as the planning horizon and number of objects grow, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose learning problem decompositions from demonstrations to accelerate TAMP solvers. Our approach consists of three key components: goal decomposition learning, computational distance learning, and object reduction. Goal decomposition identifies the necessary sequences of states that the system must pass through before reaching the final goal, treating them as subgoal sequences. Computational distance learning predicts the computational complexity between two states, enabling the system to identify the temporally closest subgoal from a disturbed state. Object reduction minimizes the set of active objects considered during replanning, further improving efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving replanning efficiency for sequential multi-object manipulation tasks in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Context-Based Meta Reinforcement Learning for Robust and Adaptable Peg-in-Hole Assembly Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous assembly is an essential capability for industrial and service robots, with Peg-in-Hole (PiH) insertion being one of the core tasks. However, PiH assembly in unknown environments is still challenging due to uncertainty in task parameters, such as the hole position and orientation, resulting from sensor noise. Although context-based meta reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been previously presented to adapt to unknown task parameters in PiH assembly tasks, the performance depends on a sample-inefficient procedure or human demonstrations. Thus, to enhance the applicability of meta RL in real-world PiH assembly tasks, we propose to train the agent to use information from the robot's forward kinematics and an uncalibrated camera. Furthermore, we improve the performance by efficiently adapting the meta-trained agent to use data from force/torque sensor. Finally, we propose an adaptation procedure for out-of-distribution tasks whose parameters are different from the training tasks. Experiments on simulated and real robots prove that our modifications enhance the sample efficiency during meta training, real-world adaptation performance, and generalization of the context-based meta RL agent in PiH assembly tasks compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>ETA-IK: Execution-Time-Aware Inverse Kinematics for Dual-Arm Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents ETA-IK, a novel Execution-Time-Aware Inverse Kinematics method tailored for dual-arm robotic systems. The primary goal is to optimize motion execution time by leveraging the redundancy of both arms, specifically in tasks where only the relative pose of the robots is constrained, such as dual-arm scanning of unknown objects. Unlike traditional inverse kinematics methods that use surrogate metrics such as joint configuration distance, our method incorporates direct motion execution time and implicit collisions into the optimization process, thereby finding target joints that allow subsequent trajectory generation to get more efficient and collision-free motion. A neural network based execution time approximator is employed to predict time-efficient joint configurations while accounting for potential collisions. Through experimental evaluation on a system composed of a UR5 and a KUKA iiwa robot, we demonstrate significant reductions in execution time. The proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, showing improved motion efficiency without sacrificing positioning accuracy. These results highlight the potential of ETA-IK to improve the performance of dual-arm systems in applications, where efficiency and safety are paramount.</description>

      <title>4D Radar-Inertial Odometry based on Gaussian Modeling and Multi-Hypothesis Scan Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are sensors that provide robustness against adverse weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, etc.), and as such they are increasingly used for odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping). However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing registration algorithms, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Following the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting for vision, in this paper we propose a summarized representation for radar scenes based on global simultaneous optimization of 3D Gaussians as opposed to voxel-based approaches, and leveraging its inherent probability distribution function for registration. Moreover, we propose tackling the problem of radar noise by optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, following existing practice we implement an Extended Kalman Filter-based Radar-Inertial Odometry pipeline in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experiments using publicly available 4D radar datasets show that our Gaussian approach is comparable to existing registration algorithms, outperforming them in several sequences.</description>

Abstract: Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative reinforcement learning (RL), multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy RL methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves 69.5% win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, demonstrating its potential for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy. To highlight VolleyBots' sim-to-real potential, we further demonstrate the zero-shot deployment of a policy trained entirely in simulation on real-world drones.</description>

Abstract: Humans possess an extraordinary ability to understand and execute complex manipulation tasks by interpreting abstract instruction manuals. For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human capabilities.Project Page: https://owensun2004.github.io/Furniture-Assembly-Web/</description>

      <title>Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient for Disturbance Attenuation and Its Application to Quadrotor Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21057v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal control policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external disturbances. While $H_\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design robust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called robust deterministic policy gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\infty$ control problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one player (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the adversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient (DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control policy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical implementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic policy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and integrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with following a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other control approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling precise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance conditions.</description>

      <title>Real-time Spatial-temporal Traversability Assessment via Feature-based Sparse Gaussian Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terrain analysis is critical for the practical ap- plication of ground mobile robots in real-world tasks, espe- cially in outdoor unstructured environments. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high- resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial- temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outper- forms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework integrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential driven vehicle in complex outdoor envi- ronments. Our code will be open-source for further research and development by the community, https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK.</description>

      <title>EvidMTL: Evidential Multi-Task Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Surface Mapping from Monocular RGB Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For scene understanding in unstructured environments, an accurate and uncertainty-aware metric-semantic mapping is required to enable informed action selection by autonomous systems. Existing mapping methods often suffer from overconfident semantic predictions, and sparse and noisy depth sensing, leading to inconsistent map representations. In this paper, we therefore introduce EvidMTL, a multi-task learning framework that uses evidential heads for depth estimation and semantic segmentation, enabling uncertainty-aware inference from monocular RGB images. To enable uncertainty-calibrated evidential multi-task learning, we propose a novel evidential depth loss function that jointly optimizes the belief strength of the depth prediction in conjunction with evidential segmentation loss. Building on this, we present EvidKimera, an uncertainty-aware semantic surface mapping framework, which uses evidential depth and semantics prediction for improved 3D metric-semantic consistency. We train and evaluate EvidMTL on the NYUDepthV2 and assess its zero-shot performance on ScanNetV2, demonstrating superior uncertainty estimation compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable depth estimation and semantic segmentation. In zero-shot mapping tests on ScanNetV2, EvidKimera outperforms Kimera in semantic surface mapping accuracy and consistency, highlighting the benefits of uncertainty-aware mapping and underscoring its potential for real-world robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Whole-Body Model-Predictive Control of Legged Robots with MuJoCo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the surprising real-world effectiveness of a very simple approach to whole-body model-predictive control (MPC) of quadruped and humanoid robots: the iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm with MuJoCo dynamics and finite-difference approximated derivatives. Building upon the previous success of model-based behavior synthesis and control of locomotion and manipulation tasks with MuJoCo in simulation, we show that these policies can easily generalize to the real world with few sim-to-real considerations. Our baseline method achieves real-time whole-body MPC on a variety of hardware experiments, including dynamic quadruped locomotion, quadruped walking on two legs, and full-sized humanoid bipedal locomotion. We hope this easy-to-reproduce hardware baseline lowers the barrier to entry for real-world whole-body MPC research and contributes to accelerating research velocity in the community. Our code and experiment videos will be available online at:https://johnzhang3.github.io/mujoco_ilqr</description>

      <title>Safe, Task-Consistent Manipulation with Operational Space Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe real-time control of robotic manipulators in unstructured environments requires handling numerous safety constraints without compromising task performance. Traditional approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APFs), suffer from local minima, oscillations, and limited scalability, while model predictive control (MPC) can be computationally expensive. Control barrier functions (CBFs) offer a promising alternative due to their high level of robustness and low computational cost, but these safety filters must be carefully designed to avoid significant reductions in the overall performance of the manipulator. In this work, we introduce an Operational Space Control Barrier Function (OSCBF) framework that integrates safety constraints while preserving task-consistent behavior. Our approach scales to hundreds of simultaneous constraints while retaining real-time control rates, ensuring collision avoidance, singularity prevention, and workspace containment even in highly cluttered settings or during dynamic motions. By explicitly accounting for the task hierarchy in the CBF objective, we prevent degraded performance across both joint-space and operational-space tasks, when at the limit of safety. We validate performance in both simulation and hardware, and release our open-source high-performance code and media on our project webpage, https://stanfordasl.github.io/oscbf/</description>

      <title>Immersive Explainability: Visualizing Robot Navigation Decisions through XAI Semantic Scene Projections in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end robot policies achieve high performance through neural networks trained via reinforcement learning (RL). Yet, their black box nature and abstract reasoning pose challenges for human-robot interaction (HRI), because humans may experience difficulty in understanding and predicting the robot's navigation decisions, hindering trust development. We present a virtual reality (VR) interface that visualizes explainable AI (XAI) outputs and the robot's lidar perception to support intuitive interpretation of RL-based navigation behavior. By visually highlighting objects based on their attribution scores, the interface grounds abstract policy explanations in the scene context. This XAI visualization bridges the gap between obscure numerical XAI attribution scores and a human-centric semantic level of explanation. A within-subjects study with 24 participants evaluated the effectiveness of our interface for four visualization conditions combining XAI and lidar. Participants ranked scene objects across navigation scenarios based on their importance to the robot, followed by a questionnaire assessing subjective understanding and predictability. Results show that semantic projection of attributions significantly enhances non-expert users' objective understanding and subjective awareness of robot behavior. In addition, lidar visualization further improves perceived predictability, underscoring the value of integrating XAI and sensor for transparent, trustworthy HRI.</description>

      <title>Auditory Localization and Assessment of Consequential Robot Sounds: A Multi-Method Study in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans but are often out of sight, so that humans need to rely on the sounds of the robots to recognize their presence. For successful human-robot interaction (HRI), it is therefore crucial to understand how humans perceive robots by their consequential sounds, i.e., operating noise. Prior research suggests that the sound of a quadruped Go1 is more detectable than that of a wheeled Turtlebot. This study builds on this and examines the human ability to localize consequential sounds of three robots (quadruped Go1, wheeled Turtlebot 2i, wheeled HSR) in Virtual Reality. In a within-subjects design, we assessed participants' localization performance for the robots with and without an acoustic vehicle alerting system (AVAS) for two velocities (0.3, 0.8 m/s) and two trajectories (head-on, radial). In each trial, participants were presented with the sound of a moving robot for 3~s and were tasked to point at its final position (localization task). Localization errors were measured as the absolute angular difference between the participants' estimated and the actual robot position. Results showed that the robot type significantly influenced the localization accuracy and precision, with the sound of the wheeled HSR (especially without AVAS) performing worst under all experimental conditions. Surprisingly, participants rated the HSR sound as more positive, less annoying, and more trustworthy than the Turtlebot and Go1 sound. This reveals a tension between subjective evaluation and objective auditory localization performance. Our findings highlight consequential robot sounds as a critical factor for designing intuitive and effective HRI, with implications for human-centered robot design and social navigation.</description>

      <title>Policy Contrastive Decoding for Robotic Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic foundation models, or generalist robot policies, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $\pi_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $\pi_0$ by 8.9% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment. Code and demos are publicly available at: https://Koorye.github.io/proj/PCD.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Limits of Vision-Language-Action Manipulations in Cross-task Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

      <title>EDEN: Efficient Dual-Layer Exploration Planning for Fast UAV Autonomous Exploration in Large 3-D Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient autonomous exploration in large-scale environments remains challenging due to the high planning computational cost and low-speed maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a fast and computationally efficient dual-layer exploration planning method. The insight of our dual-layer method is efficiently finding an acceptable long-term region routing and greedily exploring the target in the region of the first routing area with high speed. Specifically, the proposed method finds the long-term area routing through an approximate algorithm to ensure real-time planning in large-scale environments. Then, the viewpoint in the first routing region with the lowest curvature-penalized cost, which can effectively reduce decelerations caused by sharp turn motions, will be chosen as the next exploration target. To further speed up the exploration, we adopt an aggressive and safe exploration-oriented trajectory to enhance exploration continuity. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art methods in challenging simulation environments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of exploration efficiency, computational cost, and trajectory speed. We also conduct real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>From Perception Logs to Failure Modes: Language-Driven Semantic Clustering of Failures for Robot Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world environments -- ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants -- they inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to failures. While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also provide rich perceptual data for improving future performance. However, manually analyzing large-scale failure datasets is impractical. In this work, we present a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure data into semantically meaningful failure clusters, enabling scalable learning from failure without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on internet-scale data, to infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual trajectories and discover interpretable structure within uncurated failure logs. These semantic clusters reveal patterns and hypothesized causes of failure, enabling scalable learning from experience. We demonstrate that the discovered failure modes can guide targeted data collection for policy refinement, accelerating iterative improvement in agent policies and overall safety. Additionally, we show that these semantic clusters can benefit online failure monitoring systems, offering a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for real-time operation. We demonstrate that this framework enhances robot learning and robustness by transforming real-world failures into actionable and interpretable signals for adaptation.</description>

      <title>GeNIE: A Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable navigation in unstructured, real-world environments remains a significant challenge for embodied agents, especially when operating across diverse terrains, weather conditions, and sensor configurations. In this paper, we introduce GeNIE (Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments), a robust navigation framework designed for global deployment. GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2 with a novel path fusion strategy that enhances planning stability in noisy and ambiguous settings. We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support future research in real-world navigation.</description>

      <title>ADA-DPM: A Neural Descriptors-based Adaptive Noise Filtering Strategy for SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lidar SLAM plays a significant role in mobile robot navigation and high-definition map construction. However, existing methods often face a trade-off between localization accuracy and system robustness in scenarios with a high proportion of dynamic objects, point cloud distortion, and unstructured environments. To address this issue, we propose a neural descriptors-based adaptive noise filtering strategy for SLAM, named ADA-DPM, which improves the performance of localization and mapping tasks through three key technical innovations. Firstly, to tackle dynamic object interference, we design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict and filter out dynamic feature points, eliminating the ego-motion interference caused by dynamic objects. Secondly, to mitigate the impact of noise and unstructured feature points, we propose the Global Importance Scoring Head that adaptively selects high-contribution feature points while suppressing the influence of noise and unstructured feature points. Moreover, we introduce the Cross-Layer Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to construct multi-scale neighborhood graphs, fusing local structural information across different scales and improving the discriminative power of overlapping features. Finally, experimental validations on multiple public datasets confirm the effectiveness of ADA-DPM.</description>

      <title>MoRe-ERL: Learning Motion Residuals using Episodic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories. This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.</description>

      <title>ZeST: an LLM-based Zero-Shot Traversability Navigation for Unknown Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution. To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art methods, constantly reaching the final goal.</description>

      <title>Kinetostatics and Particle-Swarm Optimization of Vehicle-Mounted Underactuated Metamorphic Loading Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed, and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust performance.</description>

      <title>LIPM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Perceptive Locomotion in Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Data-driven Controller Tuning with Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a \textit{guided multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization} framework for data-efficient controller tuning that integrates corrected digital twin simulations with real-world measurements. The method targets closed-loop systems with limited-fidelity simulations or inexpensive approximations. To address model mismatch, we build a multi-fidelity surrogate with a learned correction model that refines digital twin estimates using real data. An adaptive cost-aware acquisition function balances expected improvement, fidelity, and sampling cost. Our method ensures adaptability as new measurements arrive. The digital twin accuracy is re-estimated, dynamically adapting both cross-source correlations and the acquisition function. This ensures that accurate simulations are used more frequently, while inaccurate simulation data are appropriately downweighted. Experiments on robotic drive hardware and supporting numerical studies demonstrate that our method enhances tuning efficiency compared to standard Bayesian optimization and multi-fidelity methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal swimming with body compliance in an overdamped medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elongate animals and robots use undulatory body waves to locomote through diverse environments. Geometric mechanics provides a framework to model and optimize such systems in highly damped environments, connecting a prescribed shape change pattern (gait) with locomotion displacement. However, the practical applicability of controlling compliant physical robots remains to be demonstrated. In this work, we develop a framework based on geometric mechanics to predict locomotor performance and search for optimal swimming strategies of compliant swimmers. We introduce a compliant extension of Purcell's three-link swimmer by incorporating series-connected springs at the joints. Body dynamics are derived using resistive force theory. Geometric mechanics is incorporated into movement prediction and into an optimization framework that identifies strategies for controlling compliant swimmers to achieve maximal displacement. We validate our framework on a physical cable-driven three-link limbless robot and demonstrate accurate prediction and optimization of locomotor performance under varied programmed, state-dependent compliance in a granular medium. Our results establish a systematic, physics-based approach for modeling and controlling compliant swimming locomotion, highlighting compliance as a design feature that can be exploited for robust movement in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.</description>

Abstract: Our recently introduced self-organizing nervous system (SoNS) provides robot swarms with 1) ease of behavior design and 2) global estimation of the swarm configuration and its collective environment, facilitating the implementation of online automatic code generation for robot swarms.

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM) for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel manipulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity, mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations, however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed, experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a 6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot manipulation, and contact mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback -- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

      <description>arXiv:2510.14947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.</description>

      <title>CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed online via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs in training. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</description>

      <title>The Impact of VR and 2D Interfaces on Human Feedback in Preference-Based Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning robot navigation with human preferences is essential for ensuring comfortable, and predictable robot movement in shared spaces. While preference-based learning methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), enable this alignment, the choice of the preference collection interface may influence the process. Traditional 2D interfaces provide structured views but lack spatial depth, whereas immersive VR offers richer perception, potentially affecting preference articulation. This study systematically examines how the interface modality impacts human preference collection and navigation policy alignment. We introduce a novel dataset of 2,325 human preference queries collected through both VR and 2D interfaces, revealing significant differences in user experience, preference consistency, and policy outcomes. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between immersion, perception, and preference reliability, emphasizing the importance of interface selection in preference-based robot learning. The dataset is available to support future research.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in visual understanding but often lack reliable grounding capabilities and actionable inference rates. Integrating them with open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), instance segmentation, and tracking leverages their strengths while mitigating these drawbacks. We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing segmentation masks and tracking. Once initialized, this model directly extracts segmentation masks, processing image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation. Our evaluation across datasets and robotics platforms demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, showcasing its ability to extract task-specific attributes from non-standard objects in dynamic environments.

      <title>Unseen from Seen: Rewriting Observation-Instruction Using Foundation Models for Augmenting Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

      <title>LANGTRAJ: Diffusion Model and Dataset for Language-Conditioned Trajectory Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating autonomous vehicles with controllability enables scalable testing in counterfactual or structured settings, enhancing both efficiency and safety. We introduce LangTraj, a language-conditioned scene-diffusion model that simulates the joint behavior of all agents in traffic scenarios. By conditioning on natural language inputs, LangTraj provides flexible and intuitive control over interactive behaviors, generating nuanced and realistic scenarios. Unlike prior approaches that depend on domain-specific guidance functions, LangTraj incorporates language conditioning during training, facilitating more intuitive traffic simulation control. We propose a novel closed-loop training strategy for diffusion models, explicitly tailored to enhance stability and realism during closed-loop simulation. To support language-conditioned simulation, we develop Inter-Drive, a large-scale dataset with diverse and interactive labels for training language-conditioned diffusion models. Our dataset is built upon a scalable pipeline for annotating agent-agent interactions and single-agent behaviors, ensuring rich and varied supervision. Validated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, LangTraj demonstrates strong performance in realism, language controllability, and language-conditioned safety-critical simulation, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and scalable autonomous vehicle testing.

      <title>DISCOVER: Automated Curricula for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise, requiring efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment, and overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with superhuman ability. Prior work commonly explores with the objective of solving many sparse-reward tasks, making exploration of individual high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We argue that solving such challenging tasks requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task, i.e., whose achieval will teach the agent skills required for solving the target task. We demonstrate that this sense of direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing RL algorithms, without leveraging any prior information. To this end, we propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the space of all tasks. We then perform a thorough evaluation in high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.</description>

      <title>General agents contain world models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01622v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</description>

      <title>AGENTSAFE: Benchmarking the Safety of Embodied Agents on Hazardous Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of vision-language models (VLMs) is driving a new generation of embodied agents capable of operating in human-centered environments. However, as deployment expands, these systems face growing safety risks, particularly when executing hazardous instructions. Current safety evaluation benchmarks remain limited: they cover only narrow scopes of hazards and focus primarily on final outcomes, neglecting the agent's full perception-planning-execution process and thereby obscuring critical failure modes. Therefore, we present SAFE, a benchmark for systematically assessing the safety of embodied VLM agents on hazardous instructions. SAFE comprises three components: SAFE-THOR, an extensible adversarial simulation sandbox with a universal adapter that maps high-level VLM outputs to low-level embodied controls, supporting diverse agent workflow integration; SAFE-VERSE, a risk-aware task suite inspired by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, comprising 45 adversarial scenarios, 1,350 hazardous tasks, and 9,900 instructions that span risks to humans, environments, and agents; and SAFE-DIAGNOSE, a multi-level and fine-grained evaluation protocol measuring agent performance across perception, planning, and execution. Applying SAFE to nine state-of-the-art VLMs and two embodied agent workflows, we uncover systematic failures in translating hazard recognition into safe planning and execution. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in current safety alignment and demonstrate the necessity of a comprehensive, multi-stage evaluation for developing safer embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>COMPASS: Cooperative Multi-Agent Persistent Monitoring using Spatio-Temporal Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent monitoring of dynamic targets is essential in real-world applications such as disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife conservation, where mobile agents must continuously gather information under uncertainty. We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</description>

      <title>SegDAC: Improving Visual Reinforcement Learning by Extracting Dynamic Objectc-Centric Representations from Pretrained Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to extract useful representations from high-dimensional inputs while learning effective control from sparse and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains difficult. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground the image segmentation process via text inputs. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Decision-Making for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.</description>

      <title>MoReFlow: Motion Retargeting Learning through Unsupervised Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion retargeting holds a premise of offering a larger set of motion data for characters and robots with different morphologies. Many prior works have approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data. Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability, generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines.</description>
