      <title>On Regular Negative Mass Black Holes Under Unitary Time and Proper Antichronous Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-singular black hole solution is briefly presented which violates energy conditions only at its interior by postulating a consistent shift to negative energies and gravitationally repulsive negative masses at the event horizon. This shift is the unitary parity-time $PT$ transformation of relativistic quantum mechanics and the proper antichronous transformation of the full Lorentz group. The transformation at the event horizon respects Einstein's equivalence principle, and the considered negative mass interaction does not result in the runaway motion paradox or vacuum instability. The correspondence of these regular black holes with observed ones is studied by proposing another mechanism of black hole growth independent of accretion and merging due to interior increasing entropy, which attempts to solve the unexplained size and formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes, the intermediate mass gap, and the information paradox.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle on the surface of a spherocylindrical capsule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spinless nonrelativistic quantum particle on the curved surface of a homogeneous spherocylindrical capsule is considered. We apply Costa's formalism to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with only a confined potential forcing the particle to remain on the surface and be free to move. It is shown that while a quantum particle with zero tangential/local energy can exist on the surface of a spherical shell with an arbitrary radius, it exists on a spherocylinder capsule only with a quantized length-to-radius ratio. In other words, if and only if the length-to-radius ratio of the capsule is an even multiplication of $\pi $, the wave function on the surface interferes with itself constructively such that the wave function survives. This hypothetical phenomenon may lead to applications in nanoscale measurements.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal mass creation by metricized accelerations in Euclidean matterspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic four-acceleration in metrically organized motions can introduce the nonlocal mechanism for the local generation of active and reactive mass densities in the monistic geometrodynamics of correlated matterspace. Four Hilbert variations for geometrized matterspace with Euclidean subgeometry maintain the universal equivalence of active and reactive mass densities. The vector counterbalance in the contracted Bianchi identities with the acceleration-based curvatures prevents the gravitational collapse of non-local self-organizations.</description>

      <title>Advanced Mathematical Techniques in Renormalization of Elastic Models: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we delve into the intricate mathematical frameworks essential for the renormalization of effective elastic models within complex physical systems. By integrating advanced tools such as Laurent series, residue theorem, winding numbers, and path integrals, we systematically address divergent loop integrals encountered in renormalization group analyses. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to higher-order physical models, incorporating techniques from quantum field theory and exploring quantum coherent states in complex systems. This comprehensive approach not only enhances the precision of calculating elastic anomalous exponents but also provides deeper insights into the topological structures underlying phase transitions and fixed-point behaviors. The methodologies developed herein pave the way for future explorations into more intricate many-body systems.This paper presents an extensive mathematical framework aimed at enhancing the complexity and extending the theory of Fermi condensates to high-temperature regimes. By incorporating a range of mathematical formulations from thermodynamics, statistical physics, and quantum field theory, we derive key equations and their high-temperature modifications. The study encompasses corrections to the Fermi-Dirac distribution, thermodynamic quantities of Fermi condensates, pairing gap equations within the BCS theory, correlation functions, modified Hamiltonians, path integral representations, and hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>MSSM Based Theory for Planck Precision Results (2018), Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Solution of Cosmological Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that precision measurements of cosmological parameters from the Planck Satellite Observatory (2018) can be accurately reproduced by calculating the masses of gauge bosons and their superpartners within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Our approach utilizes combined decay product equations from these gauge supermultiplets. These results strongly support the Lambda-CDM cosmological standard model. Moreover, our equations predict the masses of the ordinary nucleon, a proposed anti-supersymmetric nucleon (as a dark matter candidate), and the Higgs boson in agreement with experimental values. Our theory addresses baryon number violation, lepton number violation, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. We anticipate that the masses of winos and anti-supersymmetric nucleons will be verified through Higgs boson decay in top-anti-top quark interactions at future high-energy hadron collider experiments.</description>

      <title>The fundamental difference between logical and thermodynamic irreversibilities, or, Why Landauer's result cannot be a physical principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landauer's "principle" claims that erasing one bit of information necessarily dissipates at least Tln2 of heat into the surroundings, making a possibly logically irreversible operation also thermodynamically irreversible. It is commonly accepted that this result is a fundamental principle of physics that definitively establishes the link between information and energy. Here we show that this result cannot be general. In fact it comes: 1) from a confusion between logical and thermodynamic irreversibilities and between logical and thermodynamic states, which is reminiscent of the classic Gibbs' paradox about the joining of two volumes of the same gas; and 2) from two unnecessary constraints imposed on the erase procedure. Clarifying these points permits: to dissociate the notions of logical and thermodynamic irreversibilities; to invalidate Landauer's result as being a general physical principle; and to open the door to hardware implementations allowing erasure to follow a thermodynamically reversible, or at least quasistatic, path.</description>

      <title>Strong Perturbations in Crystalline Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiscale expansion procedure reveals a crystalline vacuum state arising as a result of resonant interactions among weak Planck-scale waves on spinor and cospinor manifolds. Quarks are presented as elastic modulations of the vacuum crystal. The complementing modes are identified with colors, and distinctions between flavors are attributed to asymmetries of the vacuum lattice. Repercussion of the theory include insights into the nature of quantum uncertainty and dark matter and energy.</description>
