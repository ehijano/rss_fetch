      <title>A method for finding distribution of metabolic energy between organismal functions: application to birds' energy expenditures to counteract gravity and to support steady and short flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production of energy (metabolism) and its distribution is vital for living organisms, both at individual level - between different functions of an organism, as well as between species of communities at different organizational levels, including food chains. Here, a new general method for finding distribution of metabolic energy between different organismal functions is proposed. The method is based on earlier discoveries (in two independent studies, for multicellular and unicellular organisms) that metabolic allometric scaling is the result of natural selection guided by optimization of distribution of common resources between the species of a food chain. This distribution is established in such a way that it secures amount of resources for each species to reproduce in sufficient quantities (sufficient for preservation of a food chain), while not allowing some species acquiring too many resources to jeopardize existence of other species they prey on or share common resources with. The introduced method was applied to birds, including both steady and short flights modes. Birds' metabolism has specifics, because besides other functions, it has to compensate force of gravity during the flight. However, this parameter is difficult to find, while such data is important for ecological studies at population and individual levels. We discovered increase of fraction of metabolic power required to compensate force of gravity with mass increase, which is a principal factor, restricting maximum possible mass of flying animals. The obtained results show efficiency of a proposed method for detailed studies of animals' metabolism, physiology, and of population ecology.</description>

      <title>Metabolic Allometric Scaling of Unicellular Organisms as a Product of Selection Guided by Optimization of Nutrients Distribution in Food Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:1612.04695v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major characteristics of living organisms is metabolic rate, which is the amount of energy produced per unit of time. When the mass of organisms increases, the metabolic rate also increases (usually as a power function of mass), but usually slower than mass. This effect is called metabolic allometric scaling. Its causes are considered unknown. The effect has important implications for individual and population organismal development. It was shown in the first part of this study, presented in a separate paper, that in the case of multicellular organisms, this effect is a consequence of natural selection and optimization of nutrient distribution between the species of a food chain, sharing resources of a common habitat. Here, in the second part that studies unicellular organisms, we discover that the same principle of natural selection guided by optimization of nutrient distribution between the species of a food chain defines also metabolic allometric scaling of unicellular organisms. To find that, we consider the metabolic properties of Amoeba proteus, fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus. The sharing of nutrients is optimized in such a way that bigger microorganisms have progressively bigger nutrient influx per unit of surface. This evolutionary arrangement secures the stability of a food chain by providing certain metabolic advantages for bigger organisms. Accounting for this regular increase of nutrient influx with mass increase, we obtained allometric exponents and their ranges close to experimental values, thus proving that metabolic allometric scaling of both multicellular and unicellular organisms is defined by the same fundamental evolutionary principle of optimized sharing of nutrients between the species of a food chain.</description>

      <title>How quantum computing can enhance biomarker discovery for multi-factorial diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, particularly for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging. Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types - multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.</description>
