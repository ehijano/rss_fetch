      <title>Mixing Times and Privacy Analysis for the Projected Langevin Algorithm under a Modulus of Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of the projected Langevin algorithm (LA) and the privacy curve of noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), beyond nonexpansive iterations. Specifically, we derive new mixing time bounds for the projected LA which are, in some important cases, dimension-free and poly-logarithmic on the accuracy, closely matching the existing results in the smooth convex case. Additionally, we establish new upper bounds for the privacy curve of the subsampled noisy SGD algorithm. These bounds show a crucial dependency on the regularity of gradients, and are useful for a wide range of convex losses beyond the smooth case. Our analysis relies on a suitable extension of the Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI) framework (Feldman et al., 2018; Altschuler and Talwar, 2022, 2023) to noisy iterations whose gradient map is not necessarily nonexpansive. This extension is achieved by designing an optimization problem which accounts for the best possible R\'enyi divergence bound obtained by an application of PABI, where the tractability of the problem is crucially related to the modulus of continuity of the associated gradient mapping. We show that, in several interesting cases -- including the nonsmooth convex, weakly smooth and (strongly) dissipative -- such optimization problem can be solved exactly and explicitly. This yields the tightest possible PABI-based bounds, where our results are either new or substantially sharper than those in previous works.</description>

      <title>Generation from Noisy Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to study the learning-theoretic foundations of generation by extending the results from Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] and Li et al. [2024] to account for noisy example streams. In the noiseless setting of Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] and Li et al. [2024], an adversary picks a hypothesis from a binary hypothesis class and provides a generator with a sequence of its positive examples. The goal of the generator is to eventually output new, unseen positive examples. In the noisy setting, an adversary still picks a hypothesis and a sequence of its positive examples. But, before presenting the stream to the generator, the adversary inserts a finite number of negative examples. Unaware of which examples are noisy, the goal of the generator is to still eventually output new, unseen positive examples. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when a binary hypothesis class can be noisily generatable. We provide such conditions with respect to various constraints on the number of distinct examples that need to be seen before perfect generation of positive examples. Interestingly, for finite and countable classes we show that generatability is largely unaffected by the presence of a finite number of noisy examples.</description>

      <title>Statistical Uncertainty Quantification for Aggregate Performance Metrics in Machine Learning Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence is supported by machine learning models (e.g., foundation models) that are pretrained on a massive data corpus and then adapted to solve a variety of downstream tasks. To summarize performance across multiple tasks, evaluation metrics are often aggregated into a summary metric, e.g., average accuracy across 10 question-answering tasks. When aggregating evaluation metrics, it is useful to incorporate uncertainty in the aggregate metric in order to gain a more realistic understanding of model performance. Our objective in this work is to demonstrate how statistical methodology can be used for quantifying uncertainty in metrics that have been aggregated across multiple tasks. The methods we emphasize are bootstrapping, Bayesian hierarchical (i.e., multilevel) modeling, and the visualization of task weightings that consider standard errors. These techniques reveal insights such as the dominance of a specific model for certain types of tasks despite an overall poor performance. We use a popular ML benchmark, the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB), to demonstrate the usefulness of our approaches.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of weight uncertainty proposed by [Blundell et al. (2015). Weight uncertainty in neural network. In International conference on machine learning, 1613-1622, PMLR.] in neural networks {(NNs)} specialized for regression tasks. {We further} investigate the effect of variance uncertainty in {their model}.

      <title>Circuit Complexity Bounds for Visual Autoregressive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the expressive ability of a specific model is essential for grasping its capacity limitations. Recently, several studies have established circuit complexity bounds for Transformer architecture. Besides, the Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) model has risen to be a prominent method in the field of image generation, outperforming previous techniques, such as Diffusion Transformers, in generating high-quality images. We investigate the circuit complexity of the VAR model and establish a bound in this study. Our primary result demonstrates that the VAR model is equivalent to a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold circuit with hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ precision. This is the first study to rigorously highlight the limitations in the expressive power of VAR models despite their impressive performance. We believe our findings will offer valuable insights into the inherent constraints of these models and guide the development of more efficient and expressive architectures in the future.</description>

      <title>DCIts -- Deep Convolutional Interpreter for time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an interpretable deep learning model for multivariate time series forecasting that prioritizes both predictive performance and interpretability - key requirements for understanding complex physical phenomena. Our model not only matches but often surpasses existing interpretability methods, achieving this without compromising accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate its ability to identify the most relevant time series and lags that contribute to forecasting future values, providing intuitive and transparent explanations for its predictions. To minimize the need for manual supervision, the model is designed so one can robustly determine the optimal window size that captures all necessary interactions within the smallest possible time frame. Additionally, it effectively identifies the optimal model order, balancing complexity when incorporating higher-order terms. These advancements hold significant implications for modeling and understanding dynamic systems, making the model a valuable tool for applied and computational physicists.</description>

      <title>Natural Variational Annealing for Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new multimodal optimization approach called Natural Variational Annealing (NVA) that combines the strengths of three foundational concepts to simultaneously search for multiple global and local modes of black-box nonconvex objectives. First, it implements a simultaneous search by using variational posteriors, such as, mixtures of Gaussians. Second, it applies annealing to gradually trade off exploration for exploitation. Finally, it learns the variational search distribution using natural-gradient learning where updates resemble well-known and easy-to-implement algorithms. The three concepts come together in NVA giving rise to new algorithms and also allowing us to incorporate "fitness shaping", a core concept from evolutionary algorithms. We assess the quality of search on simulations and compare them to methods using gradient descent and evolution strategies. We also provide an application to a real-world inverse problem in planetary science.</description>

      <title>Toward Sufficient Statistical Power in Algorithmic Bias Assessment: A Test for ABROCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic bias is a pressing concern in educational data mining (EDM), as it risks amplifying inequities in learning outcomes. The Area Between ROC Curves (ABROCA) metric is frequently used to measure discrepancies in model performance across demographic groups to quantify overall model fairness. However, its skewed distribution--especially when class or group imbalances exist--makes significance testing challenging. This study investigates ABROCA's distributional properties and contributes robust methods for its significance testing. Specifically, we address (1) whether ABROCA follows any known distribution, (2) how to reliably test for algorithmic bias using ABROCA, and (3) the statistical power achievable with ABROCA-based bias assessments under typical EDM sample specifications. Simulation results confirm that ABROCA does not match standard distributions, including those suited to accommodate skewness. We propose nonparametric randomization tests for ABROCA and demonstrate that reliably detecting bias with ABROCA requires large sample sizes or substantial effect sizes, particularly in imbalanced settings. Findings suggest that ABROCA-based bias evaluation based on sample sizes common in EDM tends to be underpowered, undermining the reliability of conclusions about model fairness. By offering open-source code to simulate power and statistically test ABROCA, this paper aims to foster more reliable statistical testing in EDM research. It supports broader efforts toward replicability and equity in educational modeling.</description>

      <title>Multi-SpaCE: Multi-Objective Subsequence-based Sparse Counterfactual Explanations for Multivariate Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning systems excel in complex tasks but often lack transparency, limiting their use in critical applications. Counterfactual explanations, a core tool within eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), offer insights into model decisions by identifying minimal changes to an input to alter its predicted outcome. However, existing methods for time series data are limited by univariate assumptions, rigid constraints on modifications, or lack of validity guarantees. This paper introduces Multi-SpaCE, a multi-objective counterfactual explanation method for multivariate time series. Using non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-SpaCE balances proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and contiguity. Unlike most methods, it ensures perfect validity, supports multivariate data and provides a Pareto front of solutions, enabling flexibility to different end-user needs. Comprehensive experiments in diverse datasets demonstrate the ability of Multi-SpaCE to consistently achieve perfect validity and deliver superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates in Fr\'echet Metrics: Barron Spaces, Paley-Wiener Spaces, and Fourier Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning is a recent development in the simulation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by means of neural networks. The idea behind this approach is to learn the behavior of an operator, such that the resulting neural network is an (approximate) mapping in infinite-dimensional spaces that is capable of (approximately) simulating the solution operator governed by the PDE. In our work, we study some general approximation capabilities for linear differential operators by approximating the corresponding symbol in the Fourier domain. Analogous to the structure of the class of H\"ormander-Symbols, we consider the approximation with respect to a topology that is induced by a sequence of semi-norms. In that sense, we measure the approximation error in terms of a Fr\'echet metric, and our main result identifies sufficient conditions for achieving a predefined approximation error. Secondly, we then focus on a natural extension of our main theorem, in which we manage to reduce the assumptions on the sequence of semi-norms. Based on some existing approximation result for the exponential spectral Barron space, we then present a concrete example of symbols that can be approximated well, and we also show the analogy of this approximation to the design of digital filters in Signal Processing.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of data driven low-rank matrix factorization for accelerated solutions of the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank methods have shown success in accelerating simulations of a collisionless plasma described by the Vlasov equation, but still rely on computationally costly linear algebra every time step. We propose a data-driven factorization method using artificial neural networks, specifically with convolutional layer architecture, that trains on existing simulation data. At inference time, the model outputs a low-rank decomposition of the distribution field of the charged particles, and we demonstrate that this step is faster than the standard linear algebra technique. Numerical experiments show that the method effectively interpolates time-series data, generalizing to unseen test data in a manner beyond just memorizing training data; patterns in factorization also inherently followed the same numerical trend as those within algebraic methods (e.g., truncated singular-value decomposition). However, when training on the first 70% of a time-series data and testing on the remaining 30%, the method fails to meaningfully extrapolate. Despite this limiting result, the technique may have benefits for simulations in a statistical steady-state or otherwise showing temporal stability.</description>

      <title>Neural Parameter Estimation with Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have led to neural networks being used to generate lightning-speed answers to complex questions, to paint like Monet, or to write like Proust. Leveraging their computational speed and flexibility, neural networks are also being used to facilitate fast, likelihood-free statistical inference. However, it is not straightforward to use neural networks with data that for various reasons are incomplete, which precludes their use in many applications. A recently proposed approach to remedy this issue inputs an appropriately padded data vector and a vector that encodes the missingness pattern to a neural network. While computationally efficient, this "masking" approach can result in statistically inefficient inferences. Here, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Our EM approach is likelihood-free, substantially faster than the conventional EM algorithm as it does not require numerical optimization at each iteration, and more statistically efficient than the masking approach. This research represents a prototype problem that indicates how improvements could be made in AI by introducing Bayesian statistical thinking. We compare the two approaches to missingness using simulated incomplete data from two models: a spatial Gaussian process model, and a spatial Potts model. The utility of the methodology is shown on Arctic sea-ice data and cryptocurrency data.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Extragradient-Type Methods -- Part 2: Generalization and Sublinear Convergence Rates under Co-Hypomonotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the first part of our project, this paper comprehensively studies two types of extragradient-based methods: anchored extragradient and Nesterov's accelerated extragradient for solving [non]linear inclusions (and, in particular, equations), primarily under the Lipschitz continuity and the co-hypomonotonicity assumptions. We unify and generalize a class of anchored extragradient methods for monotone inclusions to a wider range of schemes encompassing existing algorithms as special cases. We establish $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates on the residual norm of the underlying mapping for this general framework and then specialize it to obtain convergence guarantees for specific instances, where $k$ denotes the iteration counter. We extend our approach to a class of anchored Tseng's forward-backward-forward splitting methods to obtain a broader class of algorithms for solving co-hypomonotone inclusions. Again, we analyze $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates for this general scheme and specialize it to obtain convergence results for existing and new variants. We generalize and unify Nesterov's accelerated extra-gradient method to a new class of algorithms that covers existing schemes as special instances while generating new variants. For these schemes, we can prove $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates for the residual norm under co-hypomonotonicity, covering a class of nonmonotone problems. We propose another novel class of Nesterov's accelerated extragradient methods to solve inclusions. Interestingly, these algorithms achieve both $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ and $o(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates, and also the convergence of iterate sequences under co-hypomonotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we provide a set of numerical experiments encompassing different scenarios to validate our algorithms and theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Theory of Contrastive Pre-training and Multimodal Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal generative AI systems, such as those combining vision and language, rely on contrastive pre-training to learn representations across different modalities. While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</description>

      <title>Grokking at the Edge of Numerical Stability</title>

Abstract: Grokking, the sudden generalization that occurs after prolonged overfitting, is a surprising phenomenon challenging our understanding of deep learning. Although significant progress has been made in understanding grokking, the reasons behind the delayed generalization and its dependence on regularization remain unclear. In this work, we argue that without regularization, grokking tasks push models to the edge of numerical stability, introducing floating point errors in the Softmax function, which we refer to as Softmax Collapse (SC). We demonstrate that SC prevents grokking and that mitigating SC enables grokking without regularization. Investigating the root cause of SC, we find that beyond the point of overfitting, the gradients strongly align with what we call the na\"ive loss minimization (NLM) direction. This component of the gradient does not alter the model's predictions but decreases the loss by scaling the logits, typically by scaling the weights along their current direction. We show that this scaling of the logits explains the delay in generalization characteristic of grokking and eventually leads to SC, halting further learning. To validate our hypotheses, we introduce two key contributions that address the challenges in grokking tasks: StableMax, a new activation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without regularization, and $\perp$Grad, a training algorithm that promotes quick generalization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether. These contributions provide new insights into grokking, elucidating its delayed generalization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of existing grokking-inducing methods.

      <title>Asymptotic Inference for Multi-Stage Stationary Treatment Policy with Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes or policies are a sequence of decision functions over multiple stages that are tailored to individual features. One important class of treatment policies in practice, namely multi-stage stationary treatment policies, prescribes treatment assignment probabilities using the same decision function across stages, where the decision is based on the same set of features consisting of time-evolving variables (e.g., routinely collected disease biomarkers). Although there has been extensive literature on constructing valid inference for the value function associated with dynamic treatment policies, little work has focused on the policies themselves, especially in the presence of high-dimensional feature variables. We aim to fill the gap in this work. Specifically, we first estimate the multi-stage stationary treatment policy using an augmented inverse probability weighted estimator for the value function to increase asymptotic efficiency, and further apply a penalty to select important feature variables. We then construct one-step improvements of the policy parameter estimators for valid inference. Theoretically, we show that the improved estimators are asymptotically normal, even if nuisance parameters are estimated at a slow convergence rate and the dimension of the feature variables increases with the sample size. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method estimates a sparse policy with a near-optimal value function and conducts valid inference for the policy parameters.</description>

      <title>MOCK: an Algorithm for Learning Nonparametric Differential Equations via Multivariate Occupation Kernel Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning a nonparametric system of ordinary differential equations from trajectories in a $d$-dimensional state space requires learning $d$ functions of $d$ variables. Explicit formulations often scale quadratically in $d$ unless additional knowledge about system properties, such as sparsity and symmetries, is available. In this work, we propose a linear approach, the multivariate occupation kernel method (MOCK), using the implicit formulation provided by vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The solution for the vector field relies on multivariate occupation kernel functions associated with the trajectories and scales linearly with the dimension of the state space. We validate through experiments on a variety of simulated and real datasets ranging from 2 to 1024 dimensions. MOCK outperforms all other comparators on 3 of the 9 datasets on full trajectory prediction and 4 out of the 9 datasets on next-point prediction.</description>

      <title>Manifold Filter-Combine Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04056v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to better understand manifold neural networks (MNNs), we introduce Manifold Filter-Combine Networks (MFCNs). Our filter-combine framework parallels the popular aggregate-combine paradigm for graph neural networks (GNNs) and naturally suggests many interesting families of MNNs which can be interpreted as manifold analogues of various popular GNNs. We propose a method for implementing MFCNs on high-dimensional point clouds that relies on approximating an underlying manifold by a sparse graph. We then prove that our method is consistent in the sense that it converges to a continuum limit as the number of data points tends to infinity, and we numerically demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world and synthetic data sets.</description>

      <title>A Two-Scale Complexity Measure for Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel capacity measure 2sED for statistical models based on the effective dimension. The new quantity provably bounds the generalization error under mild assumptions on the model. Furthermore, simulations on standard data sets and popular model architectures show that 2sED correlates well with the training error. For Markovian models, we show how to efficiently approximate 2sED from below through a layerwise iterative approach, which allows us to tackle deep learning models with a large number of parameters. Simulation results suggest that the approximation is good for different prominent models and data sets.</description>

      <title>Manifolds, Random Matrices and Spectral Gaps: The geometric phases of generative diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05898v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. For this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning via Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear discriminant analysis is a widely used method for classification. However, the high dimensionality of predictors combined with small sample sizes often results in large classification errors. To address this challenge, it is crucial to leverage data from related source models to enhance the classification performance of a target model. We propose to address this problem in the framework of transfer learning.
  In this paper, we present novel transfer learning methods via regularized random-effects linear discriminant analysis, where the discriminant direction is estimated as a weighted combination of ridge estimates obtained from both the target and source models. Multiple strategies for determining these weights are introduced and evaluated, including one that minimizes the estimation risk of the discriminant vector and another that minimizes the classification error. Utilizing results from random matrix theory, we explicitly derive the asymptotic values of these weights and the associated classification error rates in the high-dimensional setting, where $p/n \rightarrow \gamma$, with $p$ representing the predictor dimension and $n$ the sample size. We also provide geometric interpretations of various weights and a guidance on which weights to choose. Extensive numerical studies, including simulations and analysis of proteomics-based 10-year cardiovascular disease risk classification, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Linear Discriminant Analysis with the Randomized Kaczmarz Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a randomized Kaczmarz method for linear discriminant analysis (rkLDA), an iterative randomized approach to binary-class Gaussian model linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for very large data. We harness a least squares formulation and mobilize the stochastic gradient descent framework to obtain a randomized classifier with performance that can achieve comparable accuracy to that of full data LDA. We present analysis for the expected change in the LDA discriminant function if one employs the randomized Kaczmarz solution in lieu of the full data least squares solution that accounts for both the Gaussian modeling assumptions on the data and algorithmic randomness. Our analysis shows how the expected change depends on quantities inherent in the data such as the scaled condition number and Frobenius norm of the input data, how well the linear model fits the data, and choices from the randomized algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that rkLDA can offer a viable alternative to full data LDA on a range of step-sizes and numbers of iterations.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Learning Fixed Parities with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning parity functions is a canonical problem in learning theory, which although computationally tractable, is not amenable to standard learning algorithms such as gradient-based methods. This hardness is usually explained via statistical query lower bounds [Kearns, 1998]. However, these bounds only imply that for any given algorithm, there is some worst-case parity function that will be hard to learn. Thus, they do not explain why fixed parities - say, the full parity function over all coordinates - are difficult to learn in practice, at least with standard predictors and gradient-based methods [Abbe and Boix-Adsera, 2022]. In this paper, we address this open problem, by showing that for any fixed parity of some minimal size, using it as a target function to train one-hidden-layer ReLU networks with perturbed gradient descent will fail to produce anything meaningful. To establish this, we prove a new result about the decay of the Fourier coefficients of linear threshold (or weighted majority) functions, which may be of independent interest.</description>
