      <title>MolTRES: Improving Chemical Language Representation Learning for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical representation learning has gained increasing interest due to the limited availability of supervised data in fields such as drug and materials design. This interest particularly extends to chemical language representation learning, which involves pre-training Transformers on SMILES sequences -- textual descriptors of molecules. Despite its success in molecular property prediction, current practices often lead to overfitting and limited scalability due to early convergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel chemical language representation learning framework, called MolTRES, to address these issues. MolTRES incorporates generator-discriminator training, allowing the model to learn from more challenging examples that require structural understanding. In addition, we enrich molecular representations by transferring knowledge from scientific literature by integrating external materials embedding. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on popular molecular property prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>A Structured Framework for Predicting Sustainable Aviation Fuel Properties using Liquid-Phase FTIR and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable aviation fuels have the potential for reducing emissions and environmental impact. To help identify viable sustainable aviation fuels and accelerate research, several machine learning models have been developed to predict relevant physiochemical properties. However, many of the models have limited applicability, leverage data from complex analytical techniques with confined spectral ranges, or use feature decomposition methods that have limited interpretability. Using liquid-phase Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra, this study presents a structured method for creating accurate and interpretable property prediction models for neat molecules, aviation fuels, and blends. Liquid-phase FTIR spectra measurements can be collected quickly and consistently, offering high reliability, sensitivity, and component specificity using less than 2 mL of sample. The method first decomposes FTIR spectra into fundamental building blocks using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to enable scientific analysis of FTIR spectra attributes and fuel properties. The NMF features are then used to create five ensemble models for predicting final boiling point, flash point, freezing point, density at 15C, and kinematic viscosity at -20C. All models were trained using experimental property data from neat molecules, aviation fuels, and blends. The models accurately predict properties while enabling interpretation of relationships between compositional elements of a fuel, such as functional groups or chemical classes, and its properties. To support sustainable aviation fuel research and development, the models and data are available on an interactive web tool.</description>

      <title>Properties of promising cartilage implants based on cellulose-polyacrylamide composite hydrogels: results of in vivo tests carried out over a period of 90-120 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-strength composite hydrogels cellulose-polyacrylamide were synthesized by free-radical polymerization of acrylamide conducted inside the previously formed physical network of regenerated plant cellulose. Partial hydrolysis of the amide groups of these hydrogels yielded their ionic forms with a degree of hydrolysis of 0.1 and 0.25. The cylindrical hydrogel samples of three compositions were implanted in the preformed osteochondral defects of the rabbit's femoral knee joints. No signs of migration or disintegration of the tested implants were revealed in the course of in vivo tests as long as 90 and 120 days after the implantation. The mechanical behavior of both the virgin hydrogels-implants and the implants extracted from the joints after in vivo experiments was studied in detail. The morphology and chemical composition of the extracted implants were studied by SEM combined with the EDX method. The results obtained were shown that the mechanical characteristics of hydrogel implants remained practically unchanged after in vivo tests. The extracted implants, as well as the initial hydrogels, endured cyclic compression loading at the amplitude up to 50 %. Compression stresses up to 3-10 MPa were recorded in these tests, which is close to the data obtained by several authors for natural articular cartilages in the same conditions of loading. The principal differences in the chemical composition and morphology of the implant area adjacent to the subchondral bone for non-ionic and ionic types of implants have been revealed. If for non-ionic types of implants in this area intensive mineralization with formation of calcium phosphates inside the polymeric hydrogel network is observed, the border area of ionic implants practically does not undergo mineralization.</description>

      <title>Investigating the hyperparameter space of deep neural network models for reaction coordinate optimization: Application to alanine dipeptide in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) from many collective variable candidates have been of great challenge in understanding reaction mechanisms in complex systems. Machine learning approaches, especially the deep neural network (DNN), have become a powerful tool and are actively applied. On the other hand, selecting the hyperparameters that define the DNN model structure remains to be a nontrivial and tedious task. Here we develop the hyperparameter tuning approach to determine the parameters in an automatic fashion from the trajectory data. The DNN models are constructed to obtain a RC from many collective variables that can adequately describe the changes of the committor from the reactant to product. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water. We find that multiple DNN models with similar accuracy can be obtained, indicating that hyperparameter space is multimodal. Nevertheless, despite the differences in the DNN model structure, the key features extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools show that all RC share the same character. In particular, the reaction in vacuum is characterized by the dihedral angles $\phi$ and $\theta$. The reaction in water also involves these dihedral angles as key features, and in addition, the electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen (H${}_{18}$) plays a role at about the transition state. The current study thus shows that, in contrast to the diversity in the DNN models, suitably optimized DNN models share the same features and share the common mechanism for the reaction of interest.</description>

      <title>The Role of Superlattice Phonons in Charge Localization Across Quantum Dot Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies are utilized in solar cells and light-harvesting devices because of their distinct physical and optical properties. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies with precision by directly attaching QDs. These systems demonstrate high carrier mobility while preserving the optical properties of the individual QD components. However, despite advancements in fabricating these superstructures, a comprehensive understanding of the charge transfer process at the microscopic level is still lacking. Here, we theoretically investigated the electron transfer dynamics across finite 1-dimensional CdSe-CdS core-shell QD arrays, with $N_{\rm dot}=2,3, \cdots$ QDs. The electronic and vibronic properties of the QD arrays were calculated using a semiempirical pseudopotential method and the electron transfer dynamics were studied using a mixed quantum-classical mapping approach. We find that as $N_{\rm dot}$ increases, the superlattice bending and the symmetric stretch modes can significantly localize electron transfer in the nonadiabatic regime, particularly when the connecting neck between the QDs is narrow, resulting in charge localization for large values of $N_{\rm dot}$. This behavior is quite different in the adiabatic limit when the neck connecting the QDs is wide, where such modes can facilitate electron transfer, partially governed by decoherence times. The interplay between electronic and super-lattice couplings is thus crucial for designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices and avoiding charge localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) nonlinear nonperturbative response of the molecular system is studied for photoisomerization reaction. The 1,3-cyclohexadiene photoisomerization is probed by the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process induced by the ultrashort few femtosecond intense laser pulse. For each of the long-lived or stable isomers, we present results for HHG spectra and HHG ellipticities, as well as multi-photon ionization. Moreover, the laser-induced electronic excitations are calculated and the effect of excitations on HHG spectra is discussed. We describe the characteristic properties of the nonlinear response for each of the isomers that can be used for ultrafast detection of the isomers by tracking the specific changes in HHG response.</description>

      <title>Accelerating inverse Kohn-Sham calculations using reduced density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ryabinkin-Kohut-Staroverov (RKS) and Kanungo-Zimmerman-Gavini (KZG) methods offer two approaches to find exchange-correlation (XC) potentials from ground state densities. The RKS method utilizes the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices to alleviate any numerical artifacts stemming from a finite basis (e.g., Gaussian- or Slater-type orbitals). The KZG approach relies solely on the density to find the XC potential, by combining a systematically convergent finite-element basis with appropriate asymptotic correction on the target density. The RKS method, being designed for a finite basis, offers computational efficiency. The KZG method, using a complete basis, provides higher accuracy. In this work, we combine both the methods to simultaneously afford accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we use the RKS solution as initial guess to the KZG method to attain a significant $3-11\times$ speedup. This work also presents a direct comparison of the XC potentials from the RKS and the KZG method and their relative accuracy on various weakly and strongly correlated molecules, using their ground state solutions from accurate configuration interaction calculations solved in a Slater orbital basis.</description>

      <title>Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Sugarcoated Haws-like AgNWs/ZIF-8/Pd for Plasmon-Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of biomass-derived materials into value-added products via photocatalysis holds significant promise in driving the development of renewable resources. However, since catalytic processes often require high temperatures and pressures, most catalysts are quite difficult to meet the requirements of high selectivity and high activity simultaneously. Herein, a plasmon-promoted photocatalyst, integrating Ag nanowires with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-confined Pd nanoparticles, is rationally designed to afford AgNWs/ZIF-8/Pd which achieve highly selective and efficient catalytic hydrogenation toward 2(5H)-Furanone under mild conditions. The plasmonic AgNWs/ZIF-8/Pd exhibited much stronger photocatalytic activity and higher selectivity compared with AgNWS/ZIF-8 and ZIF-8/Pd. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the synergistic coupling between Pd nanoparticles and AgNWs, and the possible reaction mechanism is proposed. This work provides a new approach to constructing efficient photocatalysts and offers new insights into the understanding of the influence of the plasmonic effect on photocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.</description>

      <title>A Reverse Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (RNEMD) Algorithm for Coupled Mass and Heat Transport in Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for introducing stable non-equilibrium concentration gradients in molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures. This method extends earlier Reverse Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (RNEMD) methods which use kinetic energy scaling moves to create temperature or velocity gradients. In the new scaled particle flux (SPF-RNEMD) algorithm, energies and forces are computed simultaneously for a molecule existing in two non-adjacent regions of a simulation box, and the system evolves under a linear combination of these interactions. A continuously increasing particle scaling variable is responsible for migration of the molecule between the regions as the simulation progresses, allowing for simulations under an applied particle flux. To test the method, we investigate diffusivity in mixtures of identical, but distinguishable particles, and in a simple mixture of multiple Lennard-Jones particles. The resulting concentration gradients provide Fick diffusion constants for mixtures. We also discuss using the new method to obtain coupled transport properties using simultaneous particle and thermal fluxes to compute the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and activation energies for diffusion from a single simulation. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of this new method in interfacial systems by computing the diffusive permeability for a molecular fluid moving through a nanoporous graphene membrane.</description>

      <title>Exchange-correlation potential built on the derivative discontinuity of electron density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structures are fully determined by the exchange-correlation (XC) potential. In this work, we develop a new method to construct reliable XC potentials by properly mixing the exact exchange and the local density approximation potentials in real space. The spatially dependent mixing parameter is derived based on the derivative discontinuity of electron density and is first-principle. We derived the equations for solving the mixing parameter and proposed an approximation to simplify these equations. Based on this approximation, this new method gives reasonable predictions for the ionization energies, fundamental gaps, and singlet-triplet energy differences for various molecular systems. The impact of the approximation on the constructed XC potentials is examined, and it is found that the quality of the XC potentials can be further improved by removing the approximation. This work demonstrates that the derivative discontinuity of electron density is a promising constraint for constructing high-quality XC potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01829v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling atmospheric chemistry is complex and computationally intense. Given the recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we propose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We consider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential Equation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future time evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator (NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To efficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time embedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we use the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient computation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the training optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical dataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature optical spin polarization of an electron spin qudit in a vanadyl -- free base porphyrin dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to molecular qubits can serve as a source of spin initialization or multi-level qudit generation for quantum information applications. So far, this approach has been primarily investigated in chromophore/stable radical systems. Here, we extend this concept to a meso-meso linked oxovanadium(IV) porphyrin - free base porphyrin dimer. Femtosecond transient absorption experiments reveal that photoexcitation of the free base porphyrin leads to picosecond triplet state formation via enhanced intersystem crossing. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) experiments carried out at both 85 K and room temperature reveal the formation of a long-lived spin-polarized quartet state through triplet-doublet spin mixing. Notably, a distinct hyperfine structure arising from the interaction between the electron spin quartet state and the vanadyl nucleus (51V, I=7/2) is evident, with the quartet state exhibiting long-lived spin polarization even at room temperature. Theoretical simulations of the TREPR spectra confirm the photogenerated quartet state and provide insights into the non-Boltzmann spin populations. Exploit-ing this phenomenon affords the possibility of using photoinduced triplet states in porphyrins for quantum information as a resource to polarize and magnetically couple molecular electronic or nuclear spin qubits and qudits.</description>

      <title>Microscale chemical imaging to characterize and quantify corrosion processes at the metal-electrolyte interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an experimental setup to chemically image corrosion processes at metal-electrolyte interfaces under stagnant, confined conditions relevant in a wide range of situations. The setup is based on a glass capillary, in which precipitation of corrosion products in the interfacial aqueous phase can be monitored over time with optical microscopy, and chemically and structurally characterized with microscopic synchrotron-based techniques (X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy). Moreover, quantification of precipitates through X-ray transmission measurements provides in-situ corrosion rates. We illustrate this setup for iron corrosion in a pH 8 electrolyte, revealing the critical role of O2 and iron diffusion in governing the precipitation of ferrihydrite and its transformation to goethite. Corrosion and coupled reactive transport processes can thus be monitored and fundamentally investigated at the metal-electrolyte interface, with micrometer-scale resolution. This capillary setup has potential applications for in-situ corrosion studies of various metals and environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field (FF) methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network FF models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface (PES) instead of the complex physical PES. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical FFs, equivariant neural network FFs trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their energies.</description>

      <title>High repetition rate ultrafast electron diffraction with direct electron detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) instruments typically operate at kHz or lower repetition rates and rely on indirect detection of electrons. However, these experiments encounter limitations because they are required to use electron beams containing a relatively large number of electrons (&gt;&gt;100 electrons/pulse), leading to severe space-charge effects. Consequently, electron pulses with long durations and large transverse diameters are used to interrogate the sample. Here, we introduce a novel UED instrument operating at a high repetition rate and employing direct electron detection. We operate significantly below the severe space-charge regime by using electron beams containing 1 to 140 electrons per pulse at 30-kHz. We demonstrate the ability to detect time-resolved signals from thin film solid samples with a difference contrast signal, ${\Delta}I/I_0$, and an instrument response function as low as $10^{-5}$ and 184-fs (FWHM), respectively, without temporal compression. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of increasing the repetition rate of UED experiments and adopting a direct electron detection scheme, which will be particularly impactful for gas-phase UED. Our newly developed scheme enables more efficient and sensitive investigations of ultrafast dynamics in photoexcited samples using ultrashort electron beams.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>
