      <title>Ontological models cannot adequately represent state update for sequential measurement of incompatible observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontological models (as used in the generalized contextuality literature) play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, serving as a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and even examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we analyse the quantum state update rule in these models and argue that incompatibility -- or, equivalently, order-dependent theoretical predictions of sequential measurements -- is sufficient to stop them from being able to adequately represent a scenario. This is because, as we argue, the quantum state update rule requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given the quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour. Building on this, we argue that classical wave theory is equally incompatible with ontological models, challenging the notion that generalized contextuality serves as a signature of classicality.</description>

      <title>Promising Stabs in the Dark: Theory Virtues and Pursuit-Worthiness in the Dark Energy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that we ought to conceive of the Dark Energy problem -- the question of how to account for observational data, naturally interpreted as accelerated expansion of the universe -- as a crisis of underdetermined pursuit-worthiness. Not only are the various approaches to the Dark Energy problem evidentially underdetermined; at present, no compelling reasons single out any of them as more likely to be true than the other. More vexingly for working scientists, none of the approaches stands out as uncontroversially preferable over its rivals in terms of its rationally warranted promise, i.e.~the reasons to further work on, explore, and develop it. We demonstrate this claim by applying a Peircean economic model of pursuit-worthiness in terms of a cognitive cost/benefit estimate -- with the instantiation of theory virtues as key indicators of cognitive gains -- to the four main Dark Energy proposals (the cosmological constant approach, modified gravity, quintessence, and inhomogeneous cosmologies). According to our analysis, these approaches do not admit of an unambiguous, or uncontroversial, ranking with respect to which ansatz deserves distinguished attention and research efforts. The overall methodological counsel that our analysis underwrites recommends a pragmatic double research strategy forward: to encourage and foster theory pluralism and the search for tests -- with the goal of enhancing the testability of the $\Lambda$CDM model and ``testing it to destruction".</description>
