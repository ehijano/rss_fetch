      <title>Generalising the Central Dogma as a cross-hierarchical principle of biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Dogma of molecular biology, as originally proposed by Crick, asserts that information passed into protein cannot flow back out. This principle has been interpreted as underpinning modern understandings of heredity and evolution, implying the unidirectionality of information flow from nucleic acids to proteins. Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central Dogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of information: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across generations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to facilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information. We argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a unifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of labour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular organisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a theoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution. Specifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma originates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary conflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma as an informational relationship between components of a system, this generalisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological hierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected edge oscillations in nonlinear dynamical units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many examples from quantum and classical physics are known where topological protection is responsible for the robustness of the dynamics. Less explored is the role of topological protection in the context of classical oscillatory systems. As on-site dynamics, we consider prototypical oscillator models with possible applications in biochemical systems. However, our choice of coupling geometry is inspired by models from condensed matter physics which -- in isolation -- guarantee non-trivial topology in momentum space. We choose directed couplings between units on a two-dimensional grid, alternating between weak and strong values, such that oscillations become localized at the edges of the grid while bulk units transition to oscillation-death states, resulting in a frequency chimera-like state. These patterns are resilient to parameter mismatches, additive noise, and structural defects. To explain the robustness of these edge oscillations we use topological characteristics and calculate Zak phases. As it turns out, the edge-localized oscillations result from a bulk-boundary correspondence that applies to our system even though our derived effective Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian. By appropriately tuning the system parameters, it is possible to control which regions of the two-dimensional grid are in an oscillatory state and which settle to oscillation-death states.</description>

      <title>Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.</description>
