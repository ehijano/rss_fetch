      <title>mpbn: a simple tool for efficient edition and analysis of elementary properties of Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tool mpbn offers a Python programming interface for an easy interactive editing of Boolean networks and the efficient computation of elementary properties of their dynamics, including fixed points, trap spaces, and reachability properties under the Most Permissive update mode. Relying on Answer-Set Programming logical framework, we show that mpbn is scalable to models with several thousands of nodes and is one of the best-performing tool for computing minimal and maximal trap spaces of Boolean networks, a key feature for understanding and controling their stable behaviors. The tool is available at https://github.com/bnediction/mpbn.</description>

      <title>Automated Importance Sampling via Optimal Control for Stochastic Reaction Networks: A Markovian Projection-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel alternative approach to our previous work (Ben Hammouda et al., 2023) to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) estimators for rare event probabilities for stochastic reaction networks (SRNs). In the same spirit of (Ben Hammouda et al., 2023), an efficient path-dependent measure change is derived based on a connection between determining optimal importance sampling (IS) parameters within a class of probability measures and a stochastic optimal control formulation, corresponding to solving a variance minimization problem. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the encountered curse of dimensionality by mapping the problem to a significantly lower-dimensional space via a Markovian projection (MP) idea. The output of this model reduction technique is a low-dimensional SRN (potentially even one dimensional) that preserves the marginal distribution of the original high-dimensional SRN system. The dynamics of the projected process are obtained by solving a related optimization problem via a discrete $L^2$ regression. By solving the resulting projected Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations for the reduced-dimensional SRN, we obtain projected IS parameters, which are then mapped back to the original full-dimensional SRN system, resulting in an efficient IS-MC estimator for rare events probabilities of the full-dimensional SRN. Our analysis and numerical experiments reveal that the proposed MP-HJB-IS approach substantially reduces the MC estimator variance, resulting in a lower computational complexity in the rare event regime than standard MC estimators.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for large-scale multi-agent molecular communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is recently featured as a novel communication tool to connect individual biological nanorobots. It is expected that a large number of nanorobots can form large multi-agent MC systems through MC to accomplish complex and large-scale tasks that cannot be achieved by a single nanorobot. However, most previous models for MC systems assume a unidirectional diffusion communication channel and cannot capture the feedback between each nanorobot, which is important for multi-agent MC systems. In this paper, we introduce a system theoretic model for large-scale multi-agent MC systems using transfer functions, and then propose a method to analyze the stability for multi-agent MC systems. The proposed method decomposes the multi-agent MC system into multiple single-input and single-output (SISO) systems, which facilitates the application of simple analysis technique for SISO systems to the large-scale multi-agent MC system. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method by analyzing the stability of a specific large-scale multi-agent MC system and clarify a parameter region to synchronize the states of nanorobots, which is important to make cooperative behaviors at a population level.</description>
