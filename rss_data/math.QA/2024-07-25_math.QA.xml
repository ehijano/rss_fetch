      <title>On the acyclic quantum cluster algebras with principle coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a new lower bound quantum cluster algebra which is generated by the initial quantum cluster variables and the quantum projective cluster variables of an acyclic quantum cluster algebra with principle coefficients. We show that the new lower bound quantum cluster algebra coincides with the corresponding acyclic quantum cluster algebra. Moreover, we establish a class of formulas between these generators, and obtain the dual PBW basis of this algebra.</description>

      <title>Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras and Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Li, Sheng and Tang introduced post-Hopf algebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators (on cocommutative Hopf algebras), providing an adjunction between the respective categories under the assumption that the structures involved are cocommutative. We introduce Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras, which become usual post-Hopf algebras in the cocommutative setting. In analogy with the correspondence between cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and cocommutative Hopf braces, the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is isomorphic to the category of Yetter-Drinfeld braces introduced by the author in a joint work with D. Ferri. This allows to explore the connection with matched pairs of actions and provide examples of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras. Moreover, we prove that the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is equivalent to a subcategory of Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter structures coincide with the inverse maps of Yetter-Drinfeld 1-cocycles introduced by the author and D. Ferri, and generalise bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras. Hence the previous equivalence passes to cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators. Once the surjectivity of the Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators is removed, the equivalence is replaced by an adjunction and one can recover the result of Li, Sheng and Tang in the cocommutative case.</description>

      <title>Khovanov-Rozansky homology of Coxeter knots and Schr\"oder polynomials for paths under any line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Schr\"oder polynomials $S_\tau(q,t,a)$, indexed by triangular partitions $\tau$ and prove that $S_\tau(q,t,a)$ agrees with the Poincar\'e series of the triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology of the Coxeter knot $K_\tau$ associated to $\tau$. For all integers $m,n,d\geq 1$ with $m,n$ relatively prime, the $(d,mnd+1)$-cable of the torus knot $T(m,n)$ appears as a special case. It is known that these knots are algebraic, and as a result we obtain a proof of the $q=1$ specialization of the Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende conjecture for these knots. Finally, we show that our Schr\"oder polynomial computes the hook components in the Schur expansion of the symmetric function appearing in the shuffle theorem under any line, thus proving a triangular version of the $(q,t)$-Schr\"oder theorem.</description>

      <title>Algebras over not too little discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for unitary full vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full Vertex Operator Algebras (full VOA) are extensions of two commuting Vertex Operator Algebras, introduced to formulate compact two-dimensional conformal field theory. We define unitarity, polynomial energy bounds and polynomial spectral density for full VOA. Under these conditions and local $C_1$-cofiniteness of the simple full VOA, we show that the correlation functions of quasi-primary fields define tempered distributions and satisfy a conformal version of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, including the linear growth condition.
  As an example, we show that a family of full extensions of the Heisenberg VOA satisfies all these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fusion Categories over Non-Algebraically Closed Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several complications arise when attempting to work with fusion categories over arbitrary fields. Here we describe some of the new phenomena that occur when the field is not algebraically closed, and we adapt tools such as the Frobenius-Perron dimension in order to accommodate these new effects.</description>

      <title>Into Multiplier Hopf ($*$-)Graph Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the structures introduced recently by the authors of the current paper concerning the multiplier Hopf $*$-graph algebras and also the Cuntz-Krieger algebras and their relations with the $C^*$-graph algebras, and once again by using the $C^*$-graph algebra constructions associated to our toy example, to initiate our first class of examples concerning the multiplier Hopf $*$-graph algebras.
  At the final part of the paper, we apply our study to the $SL(n)$ case over the field of complex numbers, and prove that $(\mathcal{O}(SL(n),\Delta)$ possesses the initial requirements of being a discrete quantum group in the sense of Van Daele, and propose a direction in approaching one step further to the problem raised by Wang, asking ``if finite groups of Lie type have an analogue of $q$-deformations into finite quantum groups?''.</description>

      <title>Highest-weight vectors and three-point functions in GKO coset decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT correspondence, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>
