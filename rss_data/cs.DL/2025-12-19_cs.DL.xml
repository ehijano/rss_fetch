      <title>Beyond openness: Inclusiveness and usability of Chinese scholarly data in OpenAlex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenAlex, launched in 2022 as a fully open scholarly data source, promises greater inclusiveness compared to traditional proprietary databases. This study evaluates whether OpenAlex delivers on that promise by examining its coverage and metadata quality for Chinese-language journals and their articles. Using the 2023 edition of A Guide to the Core Journals of China (GCJC) and Wanfang Data as a benchmark, we analyze three aspects: (1) journal-level coverage, (2) article-level coverage, and (3) completeness and accuracy of metadata fields. Results show that OpenAlex indexes only 37% of GCJC journals and 24% of their articles, with substantial disciplinary and temporal variation. Metadata quality is uneven: while basic fields such as title and publication year are complete, bibliographic details, author affiliations, and cited references are frequently missing or inaccurate. DOI coverage is limited, and language information is often incorrect, with most Chinese-language articles labeled as English. These findings highlight significant challenges for achieving full inclusiveness and usability in research evaluation and related activities. We conclude with recommendations for improving data aggregation strategies, DOI registration practices, and metadata standardization to enhance the integration of local scholarly outputs into global open infrastructures.</description>

      <title>OpenAlex: Features, advantages and limitations of an open database for retrieving and analysing scholarly outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenAlex is an open bibliographic database that has been proposed as an alternative to commercial platforms in a context defined by the aim of transforming science evaluation systems into more transparent sources based on open data. This paper analyses its features, information sources, entities, advantages and limitations. The results reveal numerous records lacking abstracts, affiliations and references; deficiencies in identifying document types and languages; and issues with authority control and versioning. Although OpenAlex has been adopted in important initiatives and has yielded results comparable to those obtained with commercial databases, gaps in its metadata and a lack of consistency point to a need for intensive data cleaning, suggesting it should be used with caution. The study concludes by identifying three lines of action to improve data quality: increasing publishers' commitment to completing metadata in primary sources; creating coordination structures to channel the contributions of institutional users; and endowing the project with sufficient human resources and reliable procedures to address internal quality control tasks and user support requests.</description>

      <title>Rxiv-Maker: an automated template engine for streamlined scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00836v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of preprint servers has accelerated scientific dissemination but has also shifted the technical burden of manuscript preparation to authors. This challenge is particularly acute in computational research, where manuscripts must remain synchronised with evolving data and code. We present Rxiv-Maker, a framework that resolves this by converting simple Markdown files into professionally typeset, publication-ready PDFs. Its core feature is the ability to execute embedded code, creating a self-updating manuscript where figures and statistical values are generated directly from source data during compilation. This ensures that the final document is always current and fully reproducible. By integrating with standard tools like Git and Visual Studio (VS) Code, Rxiv-Maker provides an efficient, transparent, and collaborative authoring experience, applying principles of software engineering to academic writing to foster open and verifiable science.</description>

      <title>LitFM: A Retrieval Augmented Structure-aware Foundation Model For Citation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), managing scientific literature via LLMs has become a promising direction of research. However, existing approaches often overlook the rich structural and semantic relevance among scientific literature, limiting their ability to discern the relationships between pieces of scientific knowledge, and suffer from various types of hallucinations. These methods also focus narrowly on individual downstream tasks, limiting their applicability across use cases. Here we propose LitFM, the first literature foundation model designed for a wide variety of practical downstream tasks on domain-specific literature, with a focus on citation information. At its core, LitFM contains a novel graph retriever to integrate graph structure by navigating citation graphs and extracting relevant literature, thereby enhancing model reliability. LitFM also leverages a knowledge-infused LLM, fine-tuned through a well-developed instruction paradigm. It enables LitFM to extract domain-specific knowledge from literature and reason relationships among them. By integrating citation graphs during both training and inference, LitFM can generalize to unseen papers and accurately assess their relevance within existing literature. Additionally, we introduce new large-scale literature citation benchmark datasets on three academic fields, featuring sentence-level citation information and local context. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of LitFM, achieving 28.1% improvement on retrieval task in precision, and an average improvement of 7.52% over state-of-the-art across six downstream literature-related tasks</description>
