      <title>The Cyclic and Modular Microcosm Principle in Quantum Topology</title>

Abstract: Monoidal categories with additional structure such as a braiding or some form of duality abound in quantum topology. They often appear in tandem with Frobenius algebras inside them. Motivations for this range from the theory of module categories to the construction of correlators in conformal field theory. We generalize the Baez-Dolan microcosm principle to consistently describe all these types of algebras by extending it to cyclic and modular algebras in the sense of Getzler-Kapranov. Our main result links the microcosm principle for cyclic algebras to the one for modular algebras via Costello's modular envelope. The result can be understood as a local-to-global construction for various flavors of Frobenius algebras that substantially generalizes and unifies the available, and often intrinsically semisimple methods using for example triangulations, state-sum constructions or skein theory. Several applications of the main result in conformal field theory are presented: We classify consistent systems of correlators for open conformal field theories and show that the genus zero correlators for logarithmic conformal field theories constructed by Fuchs-Schweigert can be uniquely extended to handlebodies. This establishes a very general correspondence between full genus zero conformal field theory in dimension two and skein theory in dimension three.</description>

      <title>The left heart and exact hull of an additive regular category</title>

Abstract: Quasi-abelian categories are abundant in functional analysis and representation theory. It is known that a quasi-abelian category $\mathcal{E}$ is a cotilting torsionfree class of an abelian category. In fact, this property characterizes quasi-abelian categories. This ambient abelian category is derived equivalent to the category $\mathcal{E}$, and can be constructed as the heart $\mathcal{LH}(\mathcal{E})$ of a $\operatorname{t}$-structure on the bounded derived category $\operatorname{D^b}(\mathcal{E})$ or as the localization of the category of monomorphisms in $\mathcal{E}.$
  However, there are natural examples of categories in functional analysis which are not quasi-abelian, but merely one-sided quasi-abelian or even weaker. Examples are the category of $\operatorname{LB}$-spaces or the category of complete Hausdorff locally convex spaces. In this paper, we consider additive regular categories as a generalization of quasi-abelian categories that covers the aforementioned examples. Additive regular categories can be characterized as those subcategories of abelian categories which are closed under subobjects.
  As for quasi-abelian categories, we show that such an ambient abelian category of an additive regular category $\mathcal{E}$ can be found as the heart of a $\operatorname{t}$-structure on the bounded derived category $\operatorname{D^b}(\mathcal{E})$, or as the localization of the category of monomorphisms of $\mathcal{E}$. In our proof of this last construction, we formulate and prove a version of Auslander's formula for additive regular categories.
  Whereas a quasi-abelian category is an exact category in a natural way, an additive regular category has a natural one-sided exact structure. Such a one-sided exact category can be 2-universally embedded into its exact hull. We show that the exact hull of an additive regular category is again an additive regular category.</description>

      <title>Skolem, G\"odel, and Hilbert fibrations</title>

Abstract: Grothendieck fibrations are fundamental in capturing the concept of dependency, notably in categorical semantics of type theory and programming languages. A relevant instance are Dialectica fibrations which generalise G\"odel's Dialectica proof interpretation and have been widely studied in recent years.
  We characterise when a given fibration is a generalised, dependent Dialectica fibration, namely an iterated completion of a fibration by dependent products and sums (along a given class of display maps). From a technical perspective, we complement the work of Hofstra on Dialectica fibrations by an internal viewpoint, categorifying the classical notion of quantifier-freeness. We also generalise both Hofstra's and Trotta et al.'s work on G\"odel fibrations to the dependent case, replacing the class of cartesian projections in the base category by arbitrary display maps. We discuss how this recovers a range of relevant examples in categorical logic and proof theory. Moreover, as another instance, we introduce Hilbert fibrations, providing a categorical understanding of Hilbert's $\epsilon$- and $\tau$-operators well-known from proof theory.</description>

      <title>Vertex operator algebra and parenthesized braid operad</title>

Abstract: Conformal blocks, physical quantities of chiral 2d conformal field theory, are sheaves on the configuration spaces of the complex plane, which are mathematically formulated in terms of a vertex operator algebra, its modules and associated D-modules. We show that the operad of fundamental groupoids of the configuration spaces, the parenthesized braid operad, acts on the conformal blocks by the monodromy representation.
  More precisely, let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra with $V=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} V_n$, $\dim V_n &lt;\infty$, $V_0=\mathbb{C}\bf{1}$ and $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ the category of $V$-modules $M$ such that $M$ is $C_1$-cofinite and the dual module $M^\vee$ is a finitely generated $V$-module. We show that the parenthesized braid operad weakly 2-categorically acts on $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$, and consequently $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ has a structure of the (unital) pseudo-braided category. Moreover, if $V$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite, then $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ is a balanced braided tensor category, which gives an alternative proof of a result of Huang and Lepowsky.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld Centers and Morita Equivalence Classes of Fusion 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Drinfeld center of a fusion 2-category is invariant under Morita equivalence. We go on to show that the concept of Morita equivalence between connected fusion 2-categories recovers exactly the notion of Witt equivalence between braided fusion 1-categories. A strongly fusion 2-category is a fusion 2-category whose braided fusion 1-category of endomorphisms of the monoidal unit is $\mathbf{Vect}$ or $\mathbf{SVect}$. We prove that every fusion 2-category is Morita equivalent to the 2-Deligne tensor product of a strongly fusion 2-category and an invertible fusion 2-category. We proceed to show that every fusion 2-category is Morita equivalent to a connected fusion 2-category. As a consequence, we find that every rigid algebra in a fusion 2-category is separable. This implies in particular that every fusion 2-category is separable. Conjecturally, separability ensures that a fusion 2-category is 4-dualizable. We define the dimension of a fusion 2-category, and prove that it is always non-zero. Finally, we show that the Drinfeld center of any fusion 2-category is a finite semisimple 2-category.</description>

      <title>Singular homology of roots of unity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend some basic results from the singular homology theory of topological spaces to the setting of \v{C}ech's closure spaces. We prove analogues of the excision and Mayer-Vietoris theorems and the Hurewicz theorem in dimension one. We use these results to calculate examples of singular homology groups of spaces that are not topological but are often encountered in applied topology, such as simple undirected graphs. We focus on the singular homology of roots of unity with closure structures arising from considering nearest neighbors. These examples can then serve as building blocks along with our Mayer-Vietoris and excision theorems for computing the singular homology of more complex closure spaces.</description>

      <title>Cartesian closed varieties II: links to algebra and self-similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series investigating cartesian closed varieties. In first of these, we showed that every non-degenerate finitary cartesian variety is a variety of sets equipped with an action by a Boolean algebra B and a monoid M which interact to form what we call a matched pair [B|M]. In this paper, we show that such pairs [B|M] are equivalent to Boolean restriction monoids and also to ample source-\'etale topological categories; these are generalisations of the Boolean inverse monoids and ample \'etale topological groupoids used to encode self-similar structures such as Cuntz and Cuntz--Krieger $C^\ast$-algebras, Leavitt path algebras and the $C^\ast$-algebras associated to self-similar group actions. We explain and illustrate these links, and begin the programme of understanding how topological and algebraic properties of such groupoids can be understood from the logical perspective of the associated varieties.</description>

      <title>Derived Complete Complexes at Weakly Proregular Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01687v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak proregularity of an ideal in a commutative ring is a subtle generalization of the noetherian property of the ring. Weak proregularity is of special importance for the study of derived completion, and it occurs quite often in non-noetherian rings arising in Hochschild and prismatic cohomologies.
  This paper is about several related topics: adically flat modules, recognizing derived complete complexes, the structure of the category of derived complete complexes, and a derived complete Nakayama theorem - all with respect to a weakly proregular ideal; and the preservation of weak proregularity under completion of the ring.</description>
