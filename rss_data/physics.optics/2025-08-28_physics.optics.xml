      <title>Exploiting nonlinear incoherent image formation through linear volume metaoptics for inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We showed that a 2D depth map representing an incoherent 3D opaque scene is directly encoded in the response function of an imaging optics. As a result, the optics creates an image that depends nonlinearly on the depth map. Furthermore, strong spatio-spectral dispersions in volume metaoptics can be engineered to create a complex image in response to a depth map. We hypothesize that this complexity will allow the linear volume metaoptics to nonlinearly sense and process 3D opaque scenes.</description>

      <title>Sensing with Twisted Light: Precision Measurement of Fractional Azimuthal Index to Determine Refractive Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light beams possessing orbital angular momentum (OAM) have gained significant interest in areas such as optical manipulation, quantum entanglement, and super-resolved imaging. In itself, the OAM for a Laguerre-Gaussian beam is proportional to the azimuthal index of the light field, $l$. It is in fact continuous in nature and a non-trivial parameter to measure. The ability to determine $l$ precisely would broaden the use of such beams for new applications. In this study, we generate Laguerre-Gaussian beams of differing $l$ through mode conversion using microscopic spiral phase plates (SPPs). The exact value of $l$ imparted for a given incident wavelength is dependant upon the refractive index of the media within which the SPP is immersed. Here, we show an ultra-precise approach based on laser speckle to measure the azimuthal index of these generated beams to a precision of $2\,{\times}\,10^{-5}$. This is an improvement of three orders of magnitude over previous studies. In turn, this leverages an ultra-precise measurement of the refractive index of the medium surrounding the SPP, with a best measured precision of $6.4\,{\times}\,10^{-7}$\,refractive index units. This is confirmed to be at the shot-noise limit of the system. Our study interrogates samples of sucrose and haemoglobin, only 300\,pL in volume, within a microfluidic channel. This demonstration of an original form of microfluidic refractive index sensor, based on mode conversion to light fields with OAM, may be multiplexed to measure spatio-temporal variations and gradients within biological samples.</description>

      <title>Modelling Purcell enhancement of metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) exhibit extremely high quality factors due to the lack of radiation loss and thus are widely studied for Purcell enhancement. However, a closer examination reveals that the enhancement is absent at the BIC due to the lack of out-coupling capability, but the strong enhancement is only observed at nearby configuration, namely quasi-BIC. To study this unique behavior of the Purcell enhancement near BIC, we built an analytically model with spectral parameters to analyze the Purcell enhancement on metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC. Our analytical model predicts the average Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces coupled to a luminescent medium, utilizing parameters that are formulated through the temporal coupled-mode theory and can be derived from measured spectra such as transmissivity and reflectivity. We analyzed several metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC numerically and experimentally to study the behavior of the spectral parameters as well as the resultant Purcell enhancement. We formulated the interdependence between the quality factor and the out-coupling efficiency, and revealed the existence of optimal detuning from the BIC. We also discovered that our findings are general and applicable towards realistic metasurfaces that are lossy and/or asymmetric. This discovery provides an intuitive model to understand the modal qualities of quasi-BIC and will facilitate optimization of quasi-BIC for luminescence enhancement applications.</description>

      <title>Inferring geometry and material properties from Mueller matrices with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mueller matrices (MMs) encode information on geometry and material properties, but recovering both simultaneously is an ill-posed problem. We explore whether MMs contain sufficient information to infer surface geometry and material properties with machine learning. We use a dataset of spheres of various isotropic materials, with MMs captured over the full angular domain at five visible wavelengths (450-650 nm). We train machine learning models to predict material properties and surface normals using only these MMs as input. We demonstrate that, even when the material type is unknown, surface normals can be predicted and object geometry reconstructed. Moreover, MMs allow models to identify material types correctly. Further analyses show that diagonal elements are key for material characterization, and off-diagonal elements are decisive for normal estimation.</description>

      <title>Fourier Feature Networks for High-Fidelity Prediction of Perturbed Optical Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the effects of perturbations on optical fields often requires learning highly oscillatory complex-valued functions. Standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) struggle with this task due to an inherent spectral bias, preventing them from fitting high-frequency sinusoids. To overcome this, we incorporate Fourier features - a set of predefined sinusoids dependent on the perturbation - as an additional network input. This reframes the learning problem from approximating a complex function to finding a linear combination of basis functions. We demonstrate this method by training a Fourier Feature Network to predict the transmission matrix of a multimode fibre under mechanical compression. Compared to a standard MLP, our network reduces prediction error in the output field's amplitude and phase by an order of magnitude, achieving a mean complex correlation of 0.995 with the ground truth, despite using 85% fewer parameters. This approach offers a general and robust method for accurately modelling a wide class of oscillatory physical systems.</description>

      <title>Clean few-cycle blue soliton self-compressed pulses generation in hollow-core fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue pulses with few-cycle temporal durations hold significant value in attosecond science and ultrafast spectroscopy. In this work, we combine efficient broadband frequency doubling, multiplate continuum (MPC) post-compression and blue soliton self-compression in hollow-core fibers (HCF), experimentally demonstrating HCF-based 4.4 fs clean blue soliton self-compressed pulse. Our scheme offers three-fold advantages: (1) prevention of excessive dispersion accumulation by gradually suppressing dispersion through multi-stage design; (2) enhanced overall efficiency for self-compression-based ultrashort blue pulse generation; and (3) elimination of dispersion compensation components for the final spectral broadening stage compared to post-compression schemes. This work extends HCF-based self-compression soliton to the blue spectral region and paves the way for generating energetic ultrashort blue pulses.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Deep Strong Coupling in a Multi Quantum Well Fabry-Perot Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple experimental platform to achieve deep-strong coupling using a multi-quantum well ($N = 166$) heterostructure. The heterostructure itself acts as a Fabry-P\'erot cavity, such that the photonic modes strongly couple to the cyclotron resonance to form Landau polaritons. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy reveals vacuum Rabi splitting larger than the mode spacing, resulting in a rich multi-mode polaritonic spectra which is accurately reproduced by an "all-to-all" multi-photonic, multi-electronic Hopfield coupling model. In addition, modeling of the electromagnetic field distribution inside the cavity reveals evidence of light-matter decoupling, even in the asymptotic limit of zero frequency. The system demonstrates a robust platform for exploring extreme coupling regimes and its chiral nature holds potential for chiral cavity and chiral mirror applications.</description>

      <title>Gadget to realize arbitrary polarization transformation on a higher order Poincar\'e sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a single element for all polarization transformations on a Poincar\'e sphere is impossible due to practical limitations and hence a combination of few standard wave-plates are used to construct a gadget. With this gadget it is possible to realize a polarization transformation between any two points on the Poincar\'e sphere. There is no such gadget available to perform arbitrary polarization transformation on a higher order Poincar\'e sphere. We present one gadget here in which the nature of polarization transformations by its elements is a mixture of holonomic and non-holonomic, since the elements belong to two different polarization topological index spaces.</description>

      <title>On-chip wave chaos for photonic extreme learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in demand for scalable and energy efficient artificial neural networks has put the focus on novel hardware solutions. Integrated photonics offers a compact, parallel and ultra-fast information processing platform, specially suited for extreme learning machine (ELM) architectures. Here we experimentally demonstrate a chip-scale photonic ELM based on wave chaos interference in a stadium microcavity. By encoding the input information in the wavelength of an external single-frequency tunable laser source, we leverage the high sensitivity to wavelength of injection in such photonic resonators. We fabricate the microcavity with direct laser writing of SU-8 polymer on glass. A scattering wall surrounding the stadium operates as readout layer, collecting the light associated with the cavity's leaky modes. We report uncorrelated and aperiodic behavior in the speckles of the scattering barrier from a high resolution scan of the input wavelength. Finally, we characterize the system's performance at classification in four qualitatively different benchmark tasks. As we can control the number of output nodes of our ELM by measuring different parts of the scattering barrier, we demonstrate the capability to optimize our photonic ELM's readout size to the performance required for each task.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced transient opacity in helium nanodroplets probed by single-shot coherent diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) with intense short-wavelength light pulses enables the structural characterization of individual nanoparticles in free flight with high spatial and temporal resolution. Conventional CDI assumes that the target object exhibits a linear scattering response and static electronic properties. Here, we extend this approach to investigate transient laser-driven modifications of the electronic structure in individual nanoparticles, imprinted in their time-resolved diffraction patterns. In the presence of a near-infrared laser pulse, we observe a pronounced reduction in the diffraction signal from helium nanodroplets when probed with ultrashort extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses. This effect is attributed to a light-field-induced modification of the electronic structure of the droplets, which substantially increases their XUV absorption. Our results demonstrate that single-particle diffraction can capture ultrafast light-driven electron dynamics in nanoscale systems. This paves the way for the spatiotemporal tracking of reversible changes in the electronic properties of nanoscale structures with potential applications in ultrafast X-ray optics, materials science, and all-optical signal processing.</description>

      <title>1000-Channel Integrated Optical Phased Array with 180{\deg} Field of View, High Resolution and High Scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical phased array (OPA) is a promising technology for compact, solid-state beam steering, with applications ranging from free-space optical communication to LiDAR. However, simultaneously achieving a large field of view (FOV), high resolution, and low side-lobe level (SLL) remains a major challenge. Traditional OPAs face inherent limitations: they exhibit grating lobes when emitter spacing exceeds half the operating wavelength, while at half-wavelength spacing, significant crosstalk issues persist. Previously, we demonstrated a small-scale OPA that harnesses near-field interference and beamforming via a trapezoidal slab grating and a half-wavelength-pitch waveguide array to achieve a 180{\deg} FOV. However, its resolution was limited by the small channel count. In this work, we present a 1000-channel OPA that scales this architecture while addressing key challenges in waveguide crosstalk and control complexity. By optimizing waveguide routing, we minimize inter-channel coupling in the dense waveguide array. Additionally, we propose and demonstrate a passive matrix control scheme using 20 row and 50 column pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals to arbitrarily control 1000 thermo-optic phase shifters, significantly simplifying the electronic control and packaging. Our OPA achieves grating-lobe-free beam steering across a full 180{\deg} FOV, with a high resolution of 0.07{\deg} * 0.17{\deg} and a minimum SLL of -18.7 dB at 0{\deg}. This large-scale, cost-effective chip-based OPA paves the way for next-generation high-resolution, wide-angle beam steering systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Color X-Ray Coherent Diffraction Imaging of Helium Nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-color X-ray imaging with Free Electron Laser pulses offers a powerful approach for probing ultrafast structural dynamics in nanoscale systems, combining (near-)atomic spatial resolution with femtosecond temporal precision. The first X-ray pulse captures the object's initial state, while the time-delayed second pulse records its subsequent evolution. A key challenge lies in disentangling the two views simultaneously recorded by the same detector. We demonstrate the realization of this approach on structurally varying nanoscale particles using two X-ray pulses of different photon energies, 1 and 1.2~keV. Sub-micrometer helium nanodroplets generated in vacuum are irradiated by the two X-ray pulses separated in time by up to 750 femtoseconds. Taking advantage of the high energy sensitivity of the imaging detector, we separate the overlapping images by analyzing individual pixel counts and applying pattern recognition. The helium nanodroplets' spherical shape allows us to cross-validate this approach by fitting the radial scattering profiles with Mie solutions for a bichromatic field. The excellent agreement between the two methods, particularly in the sparsely illuminated outer regions of the diffraction images where fine structural information is encoded, highlights the quality of this approach and its potential for future advanced X-ray movie techniques.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal decomposition of unitary matrices using phase masks and the discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal multiport interferometers (UMIs) have emerged as a key tool for performing arbitrary linear transformations on optical modes, enabling precise control over the state of light in essential applications of classical and quantum information processing such as neural networks and boson sampling. While UMI architectures based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks are well established, alternative approaches that involve interleaving fixed multichannel mixing layers and phase masks have recently gained interest due to their high robustness to losses and fabrication errors. However, these approaches currently lack optimal analytical methods to compute design parameters with low optical depth. In this work, we introduce a constructive decomposition of unitary matrices using a sequence of $2N+5$ phase masks interleaved with $2N+4$ discrete Fourier transform matrices. This decomposition can be leveraged to design universal interferometers based on phase masks and multimode interference couplers, implementing a discrete Fourier transform, offering an analytical alternative to conventional numerical optimization-based designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-sorting is a procedure that decomposes a light field into a basis of transverse modes, directing each mode into a separate spatial location, allowing the constituent mode intensities to be measured simultaneously. We demonstrate a mode-sorter based on a diffractive optical neural network and show that it is advantageous to include the output detection regions into the trainable set of parameters of that network. This approach outperforms traditional mode-sorting methods, achieving higher efficiency for the same crosstalk levels.</description>

      <title>Stages of commissioning alignment for three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable, autonomously, deployment of telescopes enables a wide range of possible science cases. In this paper, we present a method for multi-stage telescope alignment with a simple commercial imaging sensor. For these studies, we use a design of an example three mirror anastigmat telescope and consider how the average spot size across the detector changes as a function of primary and secondary mirror positioning. This multi-stage alignment procedure will consist of three subprocesses, starting with a coarse alignment and converging down to a finer alignment before moving on to a stage where the telescope will refine its misalignments for data acquisition. This alignment strategy has been tested and meets diffraction limited requirements on a subset of misalignment cases from a statistical Monte Carlo simulation given misalignment tolerances on the telescope.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Jaynes-Cummings model with time-dependent coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model stands as a fully quantized, fundamental framework for exploring light-matter interactions, a timely reflection on a century of quantum theory. The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</description>

      <title>From \'Etendue to the Lowest Fundamental SNR: Pixel \'Etendue (Optogeometric Factor) Interpreted as Mode Count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optogeometric factor, recently introduced as a pixel level form of \'etendue, quantifies the spatial angular throughput of a detector element. In this work its interpretation is extended by identifying optogeometric factor with the number of accessible optical modes per pixel. This mode based perspective establishes a direct link between radiometric throughput and quantum photon statistics.
  By combining optogeometric factor with the Bose Einstein distribution, an estimate of the lowest achievable signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the pixel level is derived.
  Explicit formulas are presented in both scene-based and sensor based forms, showing how the minimal SNR depends on aperture geometry, pixel pitch, f-number, wavelength, and source temperature. This formulation provides a compact and physically transparent benchmark for evaluating imaging sensors against the lowest expected quantum noise limit.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals and higher-order topological insulators represent two fundamental yet distinct classes of topological matter. While both have been extensively studied in classical-wave systems, their coexistence and controllable transition within a single platform remain largely unexplored. Meanwhile, implementing three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings, which is crucial for realizing a broad class of higher-dimensional topological phases, continues to pose significant experimental challenges. Here, we experimentally realize three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings and demonstrate that tuning the dimerized spin-orbit coupling strength enables both the coexistence of and a controllable switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases. By engineering a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial, we synthesize the required spin-orbit interactions and observe hallmark signatures of both phases: frequency spectroscopy reveals the Fermi arcs, while local density of states measurements identify the topological corner modes. Interestingly, the corner mode degeneracy doubles compared to that in the canonical Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, signaling an enriched topological structure. Our study establishes a fundamental connection between two paradigmatic topological phases and paves the way for further exploring spin-orbit-coupling induced exotic higher-dimensional topological phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Process Tomography of a Room-Temperature Alkali-Metal Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a technique for reconstructing the dynamics of open quantum systems under the Born-Markov approximation, as described by a Liouvillian superoperator, capturing both coherent and dissipative processes. While QPT is well established for qubits, it presents significant experimental challenges in multi-level qudits. In room-temperature atomic vapors, these difficulties arise from complex interactions, residual fields present in the system, environmental noise, and inhomogeneities in the medium. Overcoming these limitations is essential for accurate modeling and precise control of such systems--a critical step toward practical usage of the QPT. We present a QPT method that we experimentally validate on a room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor ensemble, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians. Our approach establishes a computationally efficient framework for characterizing open quantum systems, enabling the study of non-unitary dynamics, efficient benchmarking of quantum sensors, and data-driven identification of environmental noise correlations.</description>

Abstract: In 1962, Belarusian physicist A. P. Khapalyuk has published the paper [Doklady Akademii nauk BSSR, volume 6, issue 5, pages 301-304] devoted to the effect of resonant absorption of light in a layer of matter. This work can be considered as a first study of the phenomenon known today as coherent perfect absorption (CPA). Unfortunately, the paper by A. P. Khapalyuk was published in a local journal in Russian and is almost unknown to the English-language scientific community. Here, we give the first translation of this paper into English, accompany it with the introductory remarks including some biographical information on A. P. Khapalyuk and put it in the context of modern CPA studies.</description>

      <title>Selective Preparation of Collective States in Coupled Quantum Emitters Using the SUPER Excitation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient preparation of collective eigenstates of subwavelength-spaced optical dipoles is a prerequisite for observing their signature radiative properties and for their applications in quantum information processing. We theoretically investigate the deterministic preparation of superradiant and subradiant states of two dipole-coupled two-level quantum emitters at deep-subwavelength separation using the Swing-UP of Quantum Emitter Population (SUPER) excitation scheme. Utilizing suitable pulse parameters for two red-detuned, time-overlapping Gaussian pulses, the SUPER scheme enables close-to-unity population inversion in the targeted collective eigenstates. Furthermore, a tunable optical phase in the SUPER scheme enables the simultaneous inversions in both pure super- and subradiant states with finite populations, thereby resulting in the preparation of hybrid collective states. These results are possible to realize with or without an optical cavity. Our approach to populating the collective eigenstates in a cavity environment paves the way for the efficient preparation of these states in the presence of environmental decoherence. Our scheme enables single-photon generation, which is measured using the second-order correlation function. We also discuss in detail possible experimental realizations, in particular using solid-state emitters and molecules.</description>

      <title>Testing a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer for Earth Observations on the HEIMDAL Stratospheric Balloon Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratospheric High Altitude Balloons (HABs) have great potential as a remote sensing platform for Earth Observations that complements orbiting satellites and low flying drones. At altitudes between 20-35 kms, HABs operate significantly closer to ground than orbiting satellites, but significantly higher than most drones. HABs therefore offer a unique potential to deliver high spatial resolution imaging with large area coverage. Another two imaging parameters that are important for Earth Observation applications are spectral resolution and spectral range. In this paper, we therefore present the development and testing of a hyperspectral imaging system, able to record near-video-rate images in narrow contiguous spectral bands, from a HAB platform. In particular, we present the first stratospheric environmental tests and HAB flight of a snapshot hyperspectral camera, based on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS), which is well suited to cope with the challenges posed by the motion of the HAB platform and the stratospheric environment. We have successfully acquired images with the system under both simulated stratospheric conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory at Aarhus University and during a 5 hour HAB flight mission named HEIMDAL from Kiruna in October 2024 as part of the REXUS/BEXUS 34/35 2024 campaign organized by DLR-SNSA. The study represents a step towards deploying the HAB platform for high quality land cover classification.</description>

      <title>Conditional Normalizing Flow Surrogate for Monte Carlo Prediction of Radiative Properties in Nanoparticle-Embedded Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic, data-driven surrogate model for predicting the radiative properties of nanoparticle embedded scattering media. The model uses conditional normalizing flows, which learn the conditional distribution of optical outputs, including reflectance, absorbance, and transmittance, given input parameters such as the absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, anisotropy factor, and particle size distribution. We generate training data using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, with optical properties derived from Mie theory. Unlike conventional neural networks, the conditional normalizing flow model yields full posterior predictive distributions, enabling both accurate forecasts and principled uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate that this model achieves high predictive accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates, establishing it as a powerful and efficient surrogate for radiative transfer simulations.</description>

      <title>Hyper-spectral Imaging with Up-Converted Mid-Infrared Single-Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range provides unique molecular specificity by probing fundamental vibrational modes of molecular bonds, making it highly valuable for biomedical and biochemical applications. However, conventional MIR imaging techniques often rely on high-intensity illumination that can induce photodamage in sensitive biological tissues. Single-photon MIR imaging offers a label-free, non-invasive alternative, yet its adoption is hindered by the lack of efficient, room-temperature MIR single-photon detectors. We present a single-photon hyperspectral imaging platform that combines cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with nonlinear frequency up-conversion. This approach enables MIR spectral imaging using cost-effective, visible-wavelength silicon single-photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPADs), supporting room-temperature, low-noise, and high-efficiency operation. Time-correlated photon pairs generated via SPDC suppress classical intensity noise, enabling near shot-noise-limited hyperspectral imaging. We demonstrate chemically specific single-photon imaging across the \SIrange{2.9}{3.6}{\micro\meter} range on biological (egg yolk, yeast) and polymeric (polystyrene, polyethylene) samples. The system delivers high-contrast, label-free imaging at ultralow photon flux, overcoming key limitations of current MIR technologies. This platform paves the way toward scalable, quantum-enabled MIR imaging for applications in molecular diagnostics, environmental sensing, and biomedical research.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an experimental scheme for high-precision position measurements based on transverse-momentum-resolved two-photon interferometry with independent photons and SPAD arrays. Our scheme extends the operative range of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry beyond its intrinsic constraints due to photons indistinguishability, paving the way to applications in high-resolution imaging. We assess the experimental results against the ultimate precision bounds as determined by quantum estimation theory. Our experiment ultimately proves that transverse-momentum resolved measurements of fourth-order correlations in the fields can be employed to overcome spatial distiguishability between independent photons. The relevance of our results extends beyond sensing and imaging towards quantum information processing, as we show that partial photon distinguishability and entanglement impurity are not necessarily a nuisance in a technique that relies on two-photon interference.</description>

Abstract: Titania doped with tantala is the high index material (high n) for the optical coatings used in LIGO and Virgo and its thermal noise limits LIGO/Virgo observations of astrophysical sources. In this paper, we study temperature induced changes to optical scatter of a multilayer highly reflective coating comprised of silica (low n) and titania doped with germania (high n) as a potential candidate to reduce coating thermal noise in ground-based observatories operating at room temperature. We observe that the scatter measured at 8 degree in a small region is low, with a median starting BRDF of $1.1 \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ increasing to $1.2 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ through annealing. The results presented here show the potential of adopting titania doped with germania coatings for future upgrades to LIGO and Virgo and as a pathfinder coating for Cosmic Explorer, a next-generation detector.</description>

Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>

Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Non-classical optimization of entangled photons through complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24283</link>

Abstract: Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs -- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state. Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with multi-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum of entangled photons as a probe for relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. We show that the joint OAM spectrum from entangled states is modified by length contraction when measured by two observers moving relative to the entanglement source. This relative motion rescales the spatial dimensions, thus breaking the orthogonality of the OAM measurement process and resulting in a broadening of the joint OAM spectrum that can precisely determine the Lorentz factor. We experimentally simulate velocities up to $0.99c$, confirm the predicted broadening, and use the measurement outcomes to extract the Lorentz factor. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverage OAM structured light as a resource.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Probing the Linewidth of the 12.4-keV Solid-State $^{45}$Sc Isomeric Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</description>
