      <title>Correlation Clustering with Overlap: a Heuristic Graph Editing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation clustering seeks a partition of the vertex set of a given graph/network into groups of closely related, or just close enough, vertices so that elements of different groups are not close to each other. The problem has been previously modeled and studied as a graph editing problem, namely Cluster Editing, which assumes that closely related data elements must be adjacent. As such, the main objective (of the Cluster Editing problem) is to turn clusters into cliques as a way to identify them. This is to be obtained via two main edge editing operations: additions and deletions. There are two problems with the Cluster Editing model that we seek to address in this paper. First, ``closely'' related does not necessarily mean ``directly'' related. So closeness should be measured by relatively short distance. As such, we seek to turn clusters into (sub)graphs of small diameter. Second, in real applications, a data element can belong, or have roles, in multiple groups. In some cases, without allowing data elements to belong to more than one cluster each, makes it hard to achieve any clustering via classical partition-based methods. We address this latter problem by allowing vertex cloning, also known as vertex splitting. Heuristic methods for the introduced problem are presented along with experimental results showing the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithmic approach.</description>

      <title>Community Detection of Complex Network Based on Graph Convolution Iterative Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection can reveal the underlying structure and patterns of complex networks, identify sets of nodes with specific functions or similar characteristics, and study the evolution process and development trends of networks. Despite the myriad community detection methods that have been proposed, researchers continue to strive for ways to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of these methods. Graph convolutional neural networks can continuously aggregate the features of multiple neighboring nodes and have become an important tool in many fields. In view of this, this paper proposes a community detection method for complex networks based on graph convolution iteration algorithm. Firstly, the candidate community centers are determined by random sampling and the node attribute matrix is obtained based on the distances of nodes to community centers. Next, the graph convolution operation is implemented to obtain the convolutional node attribute matrix. Then, community partitioning method according to the convolutional node attribute matrix is presented and the effectiveness of community partitioning is measured through modularity. The method proposed in this paper is applied into to multiple random and real-world networks. The comparison results with some baseline methods demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Analyzing political stances on Twitter in the lead-up to the 2024 U.S. election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and amplifying political discourse, particularly during elections. However, the same dynamics that foster democratic engagement can also exacerbate polarization. To better understand these challenges, here, we investigate the ideological positioning of tweets related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. To this end, we analyze 1,235 tweets from key political figures and 63,322 replies, and classify ideological stances into Pro-Democrat, Anti-Republican, Pro-Republican, Anti-Democrat, and Neutral categories. Using a classification pipeline involving three large language models (LLMs)-GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Claude-Opus-and validated by human annotators, we explore how ideological alignment varies between candidates and constituents. We find that Republican candidates author significantly more tweets in criticism of the Democratic party and its candidates than vice versa, but this relationship does not hold for replies to candidate tweets. Furthermore, we highlight shifts in public discourse observed during key political events. By shedding light on the ideological dynamics of online political interactions, these results provide insights for policymakers and platforms seeking to address polarization and foster healthier political dialogue.</description>

      <title>Provably Extending PageRank-based Local Clustering Algorithm to Weighted Directed Graphs with Self-Loops and to Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local clustering aims to find a compact cluster near the given starting instances. This work focuses on graph local clustering, which has broad applications beyond graphs because of the internal connectivities within various modalities. While most existing studies on local graph clustering adopt the discrete graph setting (i.e., unweighted graphs without self-loops), real-world graphs can be more complex. In this paper, we extend the non-approximating Andersen-Chung-Lang ("ACL") algorithm beyond discrete graphs and generalize its quadratic optimality to a wider range of graphs, including weighted, directed, and self-looped graphs and hypergraphs. Specifically, leveraging PageRank, we propose two algorithms: GeneralACL for graphs and HyperACL for hypergraphs. We theoretically prove that, under two mild conditions, both algorithms can identify a quadratically optimal local cluster in terms of conductance with at least 1/2 probability. On the property of hypergraphs, we address a fundamental gap in the literature by defining conductance for hypergraphs from the perspective of hypergraph random walks. Additionally, we provide experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Topological Trajectory Classification and Landmark Inference on Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of classifying trajectories on a discrete or discretised 2-dimensional manifold modelled by a simplicial complex. Previous works have proposed to project the trajectories into the harmonic eigenspace of the Hodge Laplacian, and then cluster the resulting embeddings. However, if the considered space has vanishing homology (i.e., no "holes"), then the harmonic space of the 1-Hodge Laplacian is trivial and thus the approach fails. Here we propose to view this issue akin to a sensor placement problem and present an algorithm that aims to learn "optimal holes" to distinguish a set of given trajectory classes. Specifically, given a set of labelled trajectories, which we interpret as edge-flows on the underlying simplicial complex, we search for 2-simplices whose deletion results in an optimal separation of the trajectory labels according to the corresponding spectral embedding of the trajectories into the harmonic space. Finally, we generalise this approach to the unsupervised setting.</description>

      <title>Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multiple Correlated Networks for Exact Community Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks, focusing on edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Recent work of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased the subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we study the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of the pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \geq 3$ we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2) none of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered.</description>

      <title>The origin, consequence, and visibility of criticism in science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critique between peers plays a vital role in the production of scientific knowledge. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence on the origins of criticism, its effects on the papers and individuals involved, and its visibility within the scientific literature. Here, we address these gaps through a data-driven analysis of papers that received substantiated and explicit written criticisms. Our analysis draws on data representing over 3,000 ``critical letters'' -- papers explicitly published to critique another -- from four high profile journals, with each letter linked to its target paper. We find that the papers receiving critical letters are disproportionately among the most highly-cited in their respective journal and, to a lesser extent, among the most interdisciplinary and novel. However, despite the theoretical importance of criticism in scientific progress, we observe no evidence that receiving a critical letter affects a paper's citation trajectory or the productivity and citation impact of its authors. One explanation for the limited consequence of critical letters is that they often go unnoticed. Indeed, we find that critical letters attract only a small fraction of the citations received by their targets, even years after publication. An analysis of topical similarity between criticized papers and their citing papers indicates that critical letters are primarily cited by researchers actively engaged in a similar field of study, whereas they are overlooked by more distant communities. Although criticism is celebrated as a cornerstone to science, our findings reveal that it is concentrated on high-impact papers, has minimal measurable consequences, and suffers from limited visibility. These results raise important questions about the role and value of critique in scientific practice.</description>

      <title>Economic Hubs and the Domination of Inter-Regional Ties in World City Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities are widely considered the lifeblood of a nations economy housing the bulk of industries, commercial and trade activities, and employment opportunities. Within this economic context, multinational corporations play an important role in this economic development of cities in particular, and subsequently the countries and regions they belong to, in general. As multinational companies are spread throughout the world by virtue of ownership-subsidiary relationship, these ties create complex inter-dependent networks of cities that shape and define socio-economic status, as well as macro-regional influences impacting the world economy.
  In this paper, we study these networks of cities formed as a result of ties between multinational firms. We analyze these networks using intra-regional, inter-regional and hybrid ties (conglomerate integration) as spatial motifs defined by geographic delineation of world's economic regions. We attempt to understand how global cities position themselves in spatial and economic geographies and how their ties promote regional integration along with global expansion for sustainable growth and economic development. We study these networks over four time periods from 2010 to 2019 and discover interesting trends and patterns. The most significant result is the domination of inter-regional motifs representing cross regional ties among cities rather than national and regional integration.</description>

      <title>Relations of society concepts and religions from Wikipedia networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Google matrix of directed networks of Wikipedia articles related to 8 recent Wikipedia language editions representing different cultures (English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese). Using the reduced Google matrix algorithm we determine relations and interactions of 23 society concepts and 17 religions represented by their respective articles for each of the 8 editions. The effective Markov transitions are found to be more intense inside the two blocks of society concepts and religions while transitions between the blocks are significantly reduced. We establish 5 poles of influence for society concepts (Law, Society, Communism, Liberalism, Capitalism) as well as 5 poles for religions (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion) and determine how they affect other entries. We compute inter edition correlations for different key quantities providing a quantitative analysis of the differences or the proximity of views of the 8 cultures with respect to the selected society concepts and religions.</description>

      <title>Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is to produce coherent decisions that solve societal challenges while respecting the will of the people they represent. New governance frameworks represent this problem as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid with centralized authority. But how should this network be structured? To investigate this question, we model the set of decisions a population must make as a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved in decision-making as a social hypergraph. This allows us to consider the benefits of different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. In between these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where decision groups are formed as needed by key stakeholders to discuss and make specific decisions. This regime of effective governance allows even incoherent or polarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs. More broadly, we present not just simulation results, but a modeling framework that can be used to explore the costs and benefits of a wide range of governance strategies using bottom-up approaches and their ability to tackle decision problems that challenge standard governments.</description>

      <title>DISCO-Dynamic Interference Suppression for Radar and Communication Cohabitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the joint dynamic power allocation and multi-relay selection for the cohabitation of high-priority military radar and low-priority commercial 5G communication. To improve the 5G network performance, we design the full-duplex underlay cognitive radio network for the low-priority commercial 5G network, where multiple relays are selected for concurrently receive the signal from the source and send it to the destination. Then, we propose the interference suppression at the high-priority radar system by using both non-coherent and coherent relay cases. In particular, we formulate the optimization problem for maximizing the system rate, with the consideration of the power constraints at the 5G users and the interference constraint at the radar system. Then, we propose the mathematical analysis model to evaluate the rate performance, considering the impacts of self-interference at the relays and derive the algorithms of joint power allocation and relay selection. Our numerical results demonstrate the characteristic of the optimal configuration and the significant performance gain of coherent case with respect to the non-coherent case and the existing algorithms with single relay selections.</description>
