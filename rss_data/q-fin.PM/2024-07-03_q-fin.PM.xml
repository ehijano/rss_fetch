      <title>Quantitative Investment Diversification Strategies via Various Risk Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the developing of high-dimensional risk models to construct portfolios of securities in the US stock exchange. Investors seek to gain the highest profits and lowest risk in capital markets. We have developed various risk models and for each model different investment strategies are tested. Out of sample tests are performed on a long-term horizon from 1970 until 2023.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sectoral Profitability in the Indian Stock Market Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores using a deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for accurate stock price prediction and its implications for portfolio design. Despite the efficient market hypothesis suggesting that predicting stock prices is impossible, recent research has shown the potential of advanced algorithms and predictive models. The study builds upon existing literature on stock price prediction methods, emphasizing the shift toward machine learning and deep learning approaches. Using historical stock prices of 180 stocks across 18 sectors listed on the NSE, India, the LSTM model predicts future prices. These predictions guide buy/sell decisions for each stock and analyze sector profitability. The study's main contributions are threefold: introducing an optimized LSTM model for robust portfolio design, utilizing LSTM predictions for buy/sell transactions, and insights into sector profitability and volatility. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the LSTM model in accurately predicting stock prices and informing investment decisions. By comparing sector profitability and prediction accuracy, the work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the current financial markets in India.</description>
