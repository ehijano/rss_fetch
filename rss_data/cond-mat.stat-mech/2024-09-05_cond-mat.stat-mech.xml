      <title>Late-time ensembles of quantum states in quantum chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states undergoing quantum chaotic dynamics are expected to evolve into featureless states at late times. While this expectation holds true on an average, coarse-grained level, it is unclear if this expectation applies to higher statistical moments, as symmetries typically present in physical systems constrain the exploration of phase space. Here we study the universal structure of late-time ensembles obtained from unitary dynamics in quantum chaotic systems with symmetries, such as charge or energy conservation. We identify two limiting universal regimes depending on the initial condition. When the initial state is typical -- all the moments of the symmetry operators are equal to those of pure random states -- then the late-time ensemble is indistinguishable from the Haar ensemble in the thermodynamic limit and at the level of higher statistical moments. Otherwise, atypical initial states evolve into non-universal ensembles which can be distinguished from the Haar ensemble from simple measurements or subsystem properties. Interestingly, such atypical initial conditions are not rare, even when considering product state initial conditions, and can be found in the middle of the spectrum of Hamiltonians known to be `maximally' chaotic. In the limiting case of initial states with negligible variance of the symmetry operator (e.g., states with fixed particle number or states with negligible energy variance), the late-time ensemble has universal behavior captured by constrained RMT ensembles. Our work shows that even though midspectrum states do not explore ergodically all of phase space at late times, the late-time ensemble typically -- but not always -- exhibits the same average and sample-to-sample fluctuations as the Haar ensemble.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in continuous systems with unidirectional transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the expression for the entropy production for stochastic dynamics defined on a continuous space of states containing unidirectional transitions. The expression is derived by taking the continuous limit of a stochastic dynamics on a discrete space of states and is based on an expression for the entropy production appropriate for unidirectional transition. Our results shows that the entropy flux is the negative of the divergence of the vector firld whose components are the rates at which a dynamic variable changes in time. For a Hamiltonian dynamical system, it follows from this result that the entropy flux vanish identically.</description>

      <title>Joint probability density of a passive article with force and magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We firstly study the Navier-Stokes equation for the motion of a passive particle with harmonic, viscous, perturbative forces, subject to an exponentially correlated Gaussian force. Secondly, from the Fokker-Planck equation in an incompressible conducting fluid of magnetic field, we approximately obtain the solution of the joint probability density by using double Fourier transforms in three-time domains. In addition, the kurtosis, the correlation coefficient, and the moment from moment equation are numerically calculated.</description>

Abstract: We derive a Fokker-Planck equation for joint probability density for an active particle coupled two heat reservoirs with harmonic, viscous, random forces. The approximate solution for the joint distribution density of all-to-all and three others topologies is solved, which apply an exponential correlated Gaussian force in three-time regions of correlation time. Mean squared displacement, velocity behaviors in the form of super-diffusion, while the mean squared displacement, velocity has the Gaussian form, normal diffusion. Concomitantly, the Kurtosis, correlation coefficient, and moment from moment equation are approximately and numerically calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Fokker-Planck equation for an active particle with both radial and tangential force and perturbative force, and its approximate solution of joint probability density is obtained. In t&gt;&gt;u and u=0 regions, an active particle leads to a super-diffusive distribution for radial velocity, while the mean squared tangential velocity with both radial and tangential force and perturbative force behaviors the Gaussian diffusion. As a result, the joint probability density obtained may be similarly consistent with that for the self-propelled particle.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics of coupled oscillators under the shear-velocity boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic and stochastic coupled oscillators with inertia are studied on the rectangular lattice under the shear-velocity boundary condition. Our coupled oscillator model exhibits various nontrivial phenomena and there are various relationships with wide research areas such as the coupled limit-cycle oscillators, the dislocation theory, a block-spring model of earthquakes, and the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. We show numerically several unique nonequilibrium properties of the coupled oscillators. We find that the spatial profiles of the average value and variance of the velocity become non-uniform when the dissipation rate is large. The probability distribution of the velocity sometimes deviates from the Gaussian distribution. The time evolution of kinetic energy becomes intermittent when the shear rate is small and the temperature is small but not zero. The intermittent jumps of the kinetic energy cause a long tail in the velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>A Partition Function Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple estimator that allows to calculate the absolute value of a system's partition function from a finite sampling of its canonical ensemble. The estimator utilizes a volume correction term to compensate the effect that the finite sampling cannot cover the whole configuration space. As a proof of concept, the estimator is applied to calculate the partition function for several model systems, and the results are compared with the numerically exact solutions. Excellent agreement is found, demonstrating that a solution for an efficient calculation of partition functions is possible.</description>

      <title>Driven Lorentz model in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a tracer particle performing a random walk on a two-dimensional lattice in the presence of immobile hard obstacles. Starting from equilibrium, a constant force pulling on the particle is switched on, driving the system to a new stationary state. Our study calculates displacement moments in discrete time (number of steps $N$) for an arbitrarily strong constant driving force, exact to first order in obstacle density. We find that for fixed driving force $F$, the approach to the terminal discrete velocity scales as $\sim N^{-1} \exp(- N F^2 / 16)$ for small $F$, differing significantly from the $\sim N^{-1}$ prediction of linear response. Besides a non-analytic dependence on the force and breakdown of Einstein's linear response, our results show that fluctuations in the directions of the force are enhanced in the presence of obstacles. Notably, the variance grows as $\sim N^3$ (superdiffusion) for $F \to \infty$ at intermediate steps, reverting to normal diffusion ($\sim N$) at larger steps, a behavior previously observed in continuous time but demonstrated here in discrete steps for the first time. Unlike the exponential waiting time case, the superdiffusion regime starts immediately at $N=1$. The framework presented allows considering any type of waiting-time distribution between steps and transition to continuous time using subordination methods. Our findings are also validated through computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry Resolution of Entanglement in CFT for Twisted and Anyonic sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy (EE) in $(1+1)$-d rational conformal field theories (RCFT) with categorical non-invertible symmetries is presented. This amounts to symmetry resolving the entanglement with respect to the generalized twisted and anyonic charge sectors of the theory. The anyonic sectors label the irreducible representations of a modular fusion category defining the symmetry and can be understood through the $(2+1)$-d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) that encodes the symmetry features of the CFT. Using this, we define the corresponding generalized boundary dependent charged moments necessary for the symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy, which is the main result of this work. Furthermore, contrary to the case of invertible symmetries, we observe the breakdown of entanglement equipartition between different charged sectors at the next-to-leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff.</description>

      <title>First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in monitored Kitaev circuits: loop models, symmetry classification, and quantum Lifshitz scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits offer a versatile platform for simulating digital quantum dynamics and uncovering novel states of non-equilibrium quantum matter. One principal example are measurement-induced phase transitions arising from non-unitary dynamics in monitored circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements as an essential building block next to standard unitary gates. Although a comprehensive understanding of dynamics in generic circuits is still evolving, we contend that monitored quantum circuits yield robust phases of dynamic matter, which -- akin to Hamiltonian ground state phases -- can be categorized based on symmetries and spatial dimensionality. To illustrate this concept, we focus on quantum circuits within symmetry classes BDI and D, which are measurement-only adaptations of the paradigmatic Kitaev and Yao-Kivelson models, embodying particle-hole-symmetric Majorana fermions with or without time-reversal. We establish a general framework -- Majorana loop models -- for both symmetry classes to provide access to the phenomenology of the entanglement dynamics in these circuits, displaying both an area-law phase of localized Majorana loops and a delocalized, highly entangled Majorana liquid phase. The two phases are separated by a continuous transition displaying quantum Lifshitz scaling, albeit with critical exponents of two distinct universality classes. The loop model framework provides not only analytical understanding of these universality classes in terms of non-linear sigma models, but also allows for highly efficient numerical techniques capable of simulating excessively large circuits with up to $10^8$ qubits. We utilize this framework to accurately determine universal probes that distinguish both the entangled phases and the critical points of the two symmetry classes. Our work thereby further solidifies the concept of emergent circuit phases and their phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Maze: A System With Tunable Scale Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random magnetic field configurations are ubiquitous in nature. Such fields lead to a variety of dynamical phenomena, including localization and glassy physics in some condensed matter systems and novel transport processes in astrophysical systems. Here we consider the physics of a charged quantum particle moving in a ``magnetic maze'': a high-dimensional space filled with a randomly chosen vector potential and a corresponding magnetic field. We derive a path integral description of the model by introducing appropriate collective variables and integrating out the random vector potential, and we solve for the dynamics in the limit of large dimensionality. We derive and analyze the equations of motion for Euclidean and real-time dynamics, and we calculate out-of-time-order correlators. We show that a special choice of vector potential correlations gives rise, in the low temperature limit, to a novel scale-invariant quantum theory with a tunable dynamical exponent. Moreover, we show that the theory is chaotic with a tunable chaos exponent which approaches the chaos bound at low temperature and strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of the macroscopically degenerate tetramer-dimer phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the roughening of interfaces in phase-separated active suspensions on substrates. At large length and timescales, we show that the interfacial dynamics belongs to the |q|KPZ universality class discussed in Besse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187102 (2023). This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, instead, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <title>Multifractaility, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Thermal density functional theory approach to quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of many-body quantum systems and their emergence from microscopic laws is a topic of great significance due to its profound fundamental implications and extensive practical applications. Recent advances in experimental techniques for controlling and preparing these systems have increased interest in this area, as they have the potential to drive the development of quantum technologies. In this study, we present a density-functional theory approach to extract detailed information about the statistics of work and the irreversible entropy associated with quantum quenches at finite temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate that these quantities can be expressed as functionals of thermal and out-of-equilibrium densities, which may serve as fundamental variables for understanding finite-temperature many-body processes. We, then, apply our method to the case of the inhomogeneous Hubbard model, showing that our density functional theory based approach can be usefully employed to unveil the distinctive roles of interaction and external potential on the thermodynamic properties of such a system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of an interacting, fully spin--polarized Fermi gas in dimensions $d=2$ and $d=3$, and derive the approximate expression for the energy spectrum and the corresponding formula for the Helmholtz free energy. We analyze the thermodynamics of the system and find the lines of first--order phase transitions between the low and high density phases terminating at critical points. The properties of the corresponding phase diagrams are qualitatively different for $d=2$ and $3$, and sensitively depend on the interparticle attraction, which marks a departure from the standard van der Waals theory. The differences originate from the Pauli exclusion principle and are embeded in the fermionic nature of the system under study.</description>

      <title>UNC-104 transport properties are robust and independent of changes in its cargo binding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cargo distribution within eukaryotic cells relies on the active transport mechanisms driven by molecular motors. Despite their critical role, the intricate relationship between motor transport properties and cargo binding - and its impact on motor distribution - remains inadequately understood. Additionally, improper regulation of ubiquitination, a pivotal post-translational modification that affects protein degradation, activation, and localization, is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Recent data showed that ubiquitination can alter motor-cargo binding of the Kinesin-3 motor UNC-104 / KIF1A that transports synaptic vesicles. To investigate how ubiquitin-like modifications affect motor protein function, particularly cargo binding, transport properties, and distribution, we utilize the PLM neuron of C. elegans as a model system. Using fluorescent microscopy, we assess the distribution of cargo-bound UNC-104 motors along the axon and probe their dynamics using FRAP experiments. We model cargo binding kinetics with a Master equation and motor density dynamics using a Fokker-Planck approach. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that ubiquitin-like knockdowns enhance UNC-104's cooperative binding to its cargo. However, these modifications do not affect UNC-104's transport properties, such as processivity and diffusivity. Thus, while ubiquitin-like modifications significantly impact the cargo-binding of UNC-104, they do not alter its transport dynamics, keeping the homeostatic distribution of UNC-104 unchanged.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new thermodynamic limit for the open circuit voltage of solar cells that includes thermalization is obtained in terms of photon entropy. A simple graphical construction makes it possible to link this limit to the existing limits for single junction cells due to Trivich and Flinn, Shockley and Queisser and W\"urfel, and the thermodynamic Carnot-type limit for hot-carrier solar cell. At the fundamental level, this limit points to similarity between photovoltaic and thermoelectric energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Power-grid modelling via gradual improvement of parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of electric power systems are widely studied through the phase synchronization of oscillators, typically with the use of the Kuramoto equation. While there are numerous well-known order parameters to characterize these dynamics, shortcoming of these metrics are also recognized. To capture all transitions from phase disordered states over phase locking to fully synchronized systems, new metrics were proposed and demonstrated on homogeneous models. In this paper we aim to address a gap in the literature, namely, to examine how gradual improvement of power grid models affect the goodness of certain metrics. To study how the details of models are perceived by the different metrics, 12 variations of a power grid model were created, introducing varying level of heterogeneity through the coupling strength, the nodal powers and the moment of inertia. The grid models were compared using a second-order Kuramoto equation and adaptive Runge-Kutta solver, measuring the values of the phase, the frequency and the universal order parameters. Finally, frequency results of the models were compared to grid measurements. We found that the universal order parameter was able to capture more details of the grid models, especially in cases of decreasing moment of inertia. The most heterogeneous models showed very low synchronization and thus suggest a limitation of the second-order Kuramoto equation. Finally, we show local frequency results related to the multi-peaks of static models, which implies that spatial heterogeneity can also induce such multi-peak behavior.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method is applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical instanton theory for reaction rates at any temperature: How a rigorous real-time derivation solves the crossover temperature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instanton theory relates the rate constant for tunneling through a barrier to the periodic classical trajectory on the upturned potential energy surface whose period is $\tau=\hbar /(k_{\mathrm{B}}T)$. Unfortunately, the standard theory is only applicable below the "crossover temperature", where the periodic orbit first appears. This paper presents a rigorous semiclassical ($\hbar\to0$) theory for the rate that is valid at any temperature. The theory is derived by combining Bleistein's method for generating uniform asymptotic expansions with a real-time modification of Richardson's flux-correlation function derivation of instanton theory. The resulting theory smoothly connects the instanton result at low temperature to the parabolic correction to Eyring transition state theory at high-temperature. Although the derivation involves real time, the final theory only involves imaginary-time (thermal) properties, consistent with the standard theory. Therefore, it is no more difficult to compute than the standard theory. The theory is illustrated with application to model systems, where it is shown to give excellent numerical results. Finally, the first-principles approach taken here results in a number of advantages over previous attempts to extend the imaginary free-energy formulation of instanton theory. In addition to producing a theory that is a smooth (continuously differentiable) function of temperature, the derivation also naturally incorporates hyperasymptotic (i.e.~multi-orbit) terms, and provides a framework for further extensions of the theory.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the classical thermal Mpemba effect (where an initially hot system relaxes faster to the final equilibrium state than a cold one) to open quantum systems coupled to several reservoirs. We show that, in general, two different types of quantum Mpemba effects are possible. They may be distinguished by quantum state tomography. However, the existence of a quantum Mpemba effect (without determining the type) can already be established by measuring simpler observables such as currents or energies. We illustrate our general results for the experimentally feasible case of an interacting two-site Kitaev model coupled to two metallic leads.</description>

Abstract: Rare events play a crucial role in understanding complex systems. Characterizing and analyzing them in scale-invariant situations is challenging due to strong correlations. In this work, we focus on characterizing the tails of probability distribution functions (PDFs) for these systems. Using a variety of methods, perturbation theory, functional renormalization group, hierarchical models, large $n$ limit, and Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate universal rare events of critical $O(n)$ systems. Additionally, we explore the crossover from universal to nonuniversal behavior in PDF tails, extending Cram\'er's series to strongly correlated variables. Our findings highlight the universal and nonuniversal aspects of rare event statistics and challenge existing assumptions about power-law corrections to the leading stretched exponential decay in these tails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Fusion of irreducible modules in the periodic Temperley--Lieb algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new family ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ of modules over the enlarged periodic Temperley--Lieb algebra ${\sf{\cal E}PTL}_N(\beta)$. These modules are built from link states with two marked points, similarly to the modules ${\sf X}_{k,\ell,x,y,z}$ that we constructed in a previous paper. They however differ in the way that defects connect pairwise. We analyse the decomposition of ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ over the irreducible standard modules ${\sf W}_{k,x}$ for generic values of the parameters $z$ and $w$, and use it to deduce the fusion rules for the fusion $\sf W \times W$ of standard modules. These turn out to be more symmetric than those obtained previously using the modules ${\sf X}_{k,\ell,x,y,z}$.
  From the work of Graham and Lehrer, it is known that, for $\beta=-q-q^{-1}$ where $q$ is not a root of unity, there exists a set of non-generic values of the twist $y$ for which the standard module ${\sf W}_{\ell,y}$ is indecomposable yet reducible with two composition factors: a radical submodule ${\sf R}_{\ell,y}$ and a quotient module ${\sf Q}_{\ell,y}$. Here, we construct the fusion products $\sf W\times R$, $\sf W\times Q$ and $\sf Q\times Q$, and analyse their decomposition over indecomposable modules. For the fusions involving the quotient modules ${\sf Q}$, we find very simple results reminiscent of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ fusion rules.
  This construction with modules ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ is a good lattice regularization of the operator product expansion in the underlying logarithmic bulk conformal field theory. Indeed, it fits with the correspondence between standard modules and connectivity operators, and is useful for the calculation of their correlation functions. Remarkably, we show that the fusion rules $\sf W\times Q$ and $\sf Q\times Q$ are consistent with the known fusion rules of degenerate primary fields.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities within a subsystem are non-local observables that provide unique insights into quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we explore the behaviors of bipartite charge (and spin) fluctuations across interaction-driven "metal-insulator transitions" out of Landau Fermi liquids. The "charge insulators" include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin-$1/2$ electrons). We find that charge fluctuations $F$ exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the phase transition: $F \sim L\log(L)$ in Landau Fermi liquids and $F \sim L$ in charge insulators, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem under bipartition. In the case of composite Fermi liquids (under certain conditions), we also identify a universal constant term $-f(\theta)|\sigma_{xy}|/(2\pi)$ arising when the subsystem geometry incorporates a sharp corner. Here, $f(\theta)$ represents a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ denotes the Hall conductivity. At the critical point of each example, provided the transition is continuous, we find that the leading-order scaling $F \sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\log(L)f(\theta)C_{\rho}/2$ with the same angle dependence $f(\theta)$. The universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is linked to the predicted universal longitudinal (and Hall) resistivity jump $\Delta\rho_{xx}$ (and $\Delta\rho_{xy}$) at the critical point.</description>
