      <title>Reducing the climate impact of data portals: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbon footprint share of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has steadily increased in the past decade and is predicted to make up as much as 23 \% of global emissions in 2030. This shows a pressing need for developers, including the information retrieval community, to make their code more energy-efficient. In this project proposal, we discuss techniques to reduce the energy footprint of the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) Portal, a MediaWiki-based knowledge base. In future work, we plan to implement these changes and provide concrete measurements on the gain in energy efficiency. Researchers developing similar knowledge bases can adapt our measures to reduce their environmental footprint. In this way, we are working on mitigating the climate impact of Information Retrieval research.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Conic Classifier for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for click-through rate (CTR) prediction within industrial recommender systems, addressing the inherent challenges of numerical imbalance and geometric asymmetry. These challenges stem from imbalanced datasets, where positive (click) instances occur less frequently than negatives (non-clicks), and geometrically asymmetric distributions, where positive samples exhibit visually coherent patterns while negatives demonstrate greater diversity. To address these challenges, we have used a deep neural network classifier that uses the polyhedral conic functions. This classifier is similar to the one-class classifiers in spirit and it returns compact polyhedral acceptance regions to separate the positive class samples from the negative samples that have diverse distributions. Extensive experiments have been conducted to test the proposed approach using state-of-the-art (SOTA) CTR prediction models on four public datasets, namely Criteo, Avazu, MovieLens and Frappe. The experimental evaluations highlight the superiority of our proposed approach over Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) Loss, which is widely used in CTR prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>VISTA: Visualized Text Embedding For Universal Multi-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval becomes increasingly popular in practice. However, the existing retrievers are mostly text-oriented, which lack the capability to process visual information. Despite the presence of vision-language models like CLIP, the current methods are severely limited in representing the text-only and image-only data. In this work, we present a new embedding model VISTA for universal multi-modal retrieval. Our work brings forth threefold technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a flexible architecture which extends a powerful text encoder with the image understanding capability by introducing visual token embeddings. Secondly, we develop two data generation strategies, which bring high-quality composed image-text to facilitate the training of the embedding model. Thirdly, we introduce a multi-stage training algorithm, which first aligns the visual token embedding with the text encoder using massive weakly labeled data, and then develops multi-modal representation capability using the generated composed image-text data. In our experiments, VISTA achieves superior performances across a variety of multi-modal retrieval tasks in both zero-shot and supervised settings. Our model, data, and source code are available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Addressing Indexical Bias in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems are designed to deliver relevant content, but traditional systems may not optimize rankings for fairness, neutrality, or the balance of ideas. Consequently, IR can often introduce indexical biases, or biases in the positional order of documents. Although indexical bias can demonstrably affect people's opinion, voting patterns, and other behaviors, these issues remain understudied as the field lacks reliable metrics and procedures for automatically measuring indexical bias. Towards this end, we introduce the PAIR framework, which supports automatic bias audits for ranked documents or entire IR systems. After introducing DUO, the first general-purpose automatic bias metric, we run an extensive evaluation of 8 IR systems on a new corpus of 32k synthetic and 4.7k natural documents, with 4k queries spanning 1.4k controversial issue topics. A human behavioral study validates our approach, showing that our bias metric can help predict when and how indexical bias will shift a reader's opinion.</description>

      <title>Attribute-Aware Implicit Modality Alignment for Text Attribute Person Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text attribute person search aims to find specific pedestrians through given textual attributes, which is very meaningful in the scene of searching for designated pedestrians through witness descriptions. The key challenge is the significant modality gap between textual attributes and images. Previous methods focused on achieving explicit representation and alignment through unimodal pre-trained models. Nevertheless, the absence of inter-modality correspondence in these models may lead to distortions in the local information of intra-modality. Moreover, these methods only considered the alignment of inter-modality and ignored the differences between different attribute categories. To mitigate the above problems, we propose an Attribute-Aware Implicit Modality Alignment (AIMA) framework to learn the correspondence of local representations between textual attributes and images and combine global representation matching to narrow the modality gap. Firstly, we introduce the CLIP model as the backbone and design prompt templates to transform attribute combinations into structured sentences. This facilitates the model's ability to better understand and match image details. Next, we design a Masked Attribute Prediction (MAP) module that predicts the masked attributes after the interaction of image and masked textual attribute features through multi-modal interaction, thereby achieving implicit local relationship alignment. Finally, we propose an Attribute-IoU Guided Intra-Modal Contrastive (A-IoU IMC) loss, aligning the distribution of different textual attributes in the embedding space with their IoU distribution, achieving better semantic arrangement. Extensive experiments on the Market-1501 Attribute, PETA, and PA100K datasets show that the performance of our proposed method significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>XL-HeadTags: Leveraging Multimodal Retrieval Augmentation for the Multilingual Generation of News Headlines and Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millions of news articles published online daily can overwhelm readers. Headlines and entity (topic) tags are essential for guiding readers to decide if the content is worth their time. While headline generation has been extensively studied, tag generation remains largely unexplored, yet it offers readers better access to topics of interest. The need for conciseness in capturing readers' attention necessitates improved content selection strategies for identifying salient and relevant segments within lengthy articles, thereby guiding language models effectively. To address this, we propose to leverage auxiliary information such as images and captions embedded in the articles to retrieve relevant sentences and utilize instruction tuning with variations to generate both headlines and tags for news articles in a multilingual context. To make use of the auxiliary information, we have compiled a dataset named XL-HeadTags, which includes 20 languages across 6 diverse language families. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play multimodal-multilingual retrievers for both tasks. Additionally, we have developed a suite of tools for processing and evaluating multilingual texts, significantly contributing to the research community by enabling more accurate and efficient analysis across languages.</description>

      <title>Beyond Similarity: Personalized Federated Recommendation with Composite Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated recommendation aims to collect global knowledge by aggregating local models from massive devices, to provide recommendations while ensuring privacy. Current methods mainly leverage aggregation functions invented by federated vision community to aggregate parameters from similar clients, e.g., clustering aggregation. Despite considerable performance, we argue that it is suboptimal to apply them to federated recommendation directly. This is mainly reflected in the disparate model architectures. Different from structured parameters like convolutional neural networks in federated vision, federated recommender models usually distinguish itself by employing one-to-one item embedding table. Such a discrepancy induces the challenging embedding skew issue, which continually updates the trained embeddings but ignores the non-trained ones during aggregation, thus failing to predict future items accurately. To this end, we propose a personalized Federated recommendation model with Composite Aggregation (FedCA), which not only aggregates similar clients to enhance trained embeddings, but also aggregates complementary clients to update non-trained embeddings. Besides, we formulate the overall learning process into a unified optimization algorithm to jointly learn the similarity and complementarity. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed model. The source codes are available at https://github.com/hongleizhang/FedCA.</description>

      <title>On The Persona-based Summarization of Domain-Specific Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an ever-expanding world of domain-specific knowledge, the increasing complexity of consuming, and storing information necessitates the generation of summaries from large information repositories. However, every persona of a domain has different requirements of information and hence their summarization. For example, in the healthcare domain, a persona-based (such as Doctor, Nurse, Patient etc.) approach is imperative to deliver targeted medical information efficiently. Persona-based summarization of domain-specific information by humans is a high cognitive load task and is generally not preferred. The summaries generated by two different humans have high variability and do not scale in cost and subject matter expertise as domains and personas grow. Further, AI-generated summaries using generic Large Language Models (LLMs) may not necessarily offer satisfactory accuracy for different domains unless they have been specifically trained on domain-specific data and can also be very expensive to use in day-to-day operations. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold: 1) We present an approach to efficiently fine-tune a domain-specific small foundation LLM using a healthcare corpus and also show that we can effectively evaluate the summarization quality using AI-based critiquing. 2) We further show that AI-based critiquing has good concordance with Human-based critiquing of the summaries. Hence, such AI-based pipelines to generate domain-specific persona-based summaries can be easily scaled to other domains such as legal, enterprise documents, education etc. in a very efficient and cost-effective manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized data markets can provide more equitable forms of data acquisition for machine learning. However, to realize practical marketplaces, efficient techniques for seller selection need to be developed. We propose and benchmark federated data measurements to allow a data buyer to find sellers with relevant and diverse datasets. Diversity and relevance measures enable a buyer to make relative comparisons between sellers without requiring intermediate brokers and training task-dependent models.</description>

      <title>PaCE: Parsimonious Concept Engineering for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used for a wide variety of tasks. While they are capable of generating human-like responses, they can also produce undesirable output including potentially harmful information, racist or sexist language, and hallucinations. Alignment methods are designed to reduce such undesirable output, via techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and representation engineering. However, existing methods face several challenges: some require costly fine-tuning for every alignment task; some do not adequately remove undesirable concepts, failing alignment; some remove benign concepts, lowering the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Parsimonious Concept Engineering (PaCE), a novel activation engineering framework for alignment. First, to sufficiently model the concepts, we construct a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, in which each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Then, given any alignment task, we instruct a concept partitioner to efficiently annotate the concepts as benign or undesirable. Finally, at inference time, we decompose the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding, to accurately represent the activation as a linear combination of the benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activation, we reorient the behavior of LLMs towards alignment goals. We conduct experiments on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, and show that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance while maintaining linguistic capabilities.</description>

      <title>What's happening in your neighborhood? A Weakly Supervised Approach to Detect Local News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local news articles are a subset of news that impact users in a geographical area, such as a city, county, or state. Detecting local news (Step 1) and subsequently deciding its geographical location as well as radius of impact (Step 2) are two important steps towards accurate local news recommendation. Naive rule-based methods, such as detecting city names from the news title, tend to give erroneous results due to lack of understanding of the news content. Empowered by the latest development in natural language processing, we develop an integrated pipeline that enables automatic local news detection and content-based local news recommendations. In this paper, we focus on Step 1 of the pipeline, which highlights: (1) a weakly supervised framework incorporated with domain knowledge and auto data processing, and (2) scalability to multi-lingual settings. Compared with Stanford CoreNLP NER model, our pipeline has higher precision and recall evaluated on a real-world and human-labeled dataset. This pipeline has potential to more precise local news to users, helps local businesses get more exposure, and gives people more information about their neighborhood safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose ListT5, a novel reranking approach based on Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) that handles multiple candidate passages at both train and inference time. We also introduce an efficient inference framework for listwise ranking based on m-ary tournament sort with output caching. We evaluate and compare our model on the BEIR benchmark for zero-shot retrieval task, demonstrating that ListT5 (1) outperforms the state-of-the-art RankT5 baseline with a notable +1.3 gain in the average NDCG@10 score, (2) has an efficiency comparable to pointwise ranking models and surpasses the efficiency of previous listwise ranking models, and (3) overcomes the lost-in-the-middle problem of previous listwise rerankers. Our code, model checkpoints, and the evaluation framework are fully open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/soyoung97/ListT5}.</description>

      <title>Is Table Retrieval a Solved Problem? Exploring Join-Aware Multi-Table Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieving relevant tables containing the necessary information to accurately answer a given question over tables is critical to open-domain question-answering (QA) systems. Previous methods assume the answer to such a question can be found either in a single table or multiple tables identified through question decomposition or rewriting. However, neither of these approaches is sufficient, as many questions require retrieving multiple tables and joining them through a join plan that cannot be discerned from the user query itself. If the join plan is not considered in the retrieval stage, the subsequent steps of reasoning and answering based on those retrieved tables are likely to be incorrect. To address this problem, we introduce a method that uncovers useful join relations for any query and database during table retrieval. We use a novel re-ranking method formulated as a mixed-integer program that considers not only table-query relevance but also table-table relevance that requires inferring join relationships. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for table retrieval by up to 9.3% in F1 score and for end-to-end QA by up to 5.4% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spiral of Silences: How is Large Language Model Killing Information Retrieval? -- A Case Study on Open Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practice of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval systems, has become increasingly prevalent. However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infiltrating the web and influencing the retrieval-generation feedback loop are largely uncharted territories. In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems. Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our findings reveal a potential digital "Spiral of Silence" effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online. This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Evaluators for Recommendation Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explainability of recommender systems has attracted significant attention in academia and industry. Many efforts have been made for explainable recommendations, yet evaluating the quality of the explanations remains a challenging and unresolved issue. In recent years, leveraging LLMs as evaluators presents a promising avenue in Natural Language Processing tasks (e.g., sentiment classification, information extraction), as they perform strong capabilities in instruction following and common-sense reasoning. However, evaluating recommendation explanatory texts is different from these NLG tasks, as its criteria are related to human perceptions and are usually subjective. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can serve as evaluators of recommendation explanations. To answer the question, we utilize real user feedback on explanations given from previous work and additionally collect third-party annotations and LLM evaluations. We design and apply a 3-level meta evaluation strategy to measure the correlation between evaluator labels and the ground truth provided by users. Our experiments reveal that LLMs, such as GPT4, can provide comparable evaluations with appropriate prompts and settings. We also provide further insights into combining human labels with the LLM evaluation process and utilizing ensembles of multiple heterogeneous LLM evaluators to enhance the accuracy and stability of evaluations. Our study verifies that utilizing LLMs as evaluators can be an accurate, reproducible and cost-effective solution for evaluating recommendation explanation texts.

      <title>CoopHash: Cooperative Learning of Multipurpose Descriptor and Contrastive Pair Generator via Variational MCMC Teaching for Supervised Image Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging supervised information can lead to superior retrieval performance in the image hashing domain but the performance degrades significantly without enough labeled data. One effective solution to boost performance is to employ generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to generate synthetic data in an image hashing model. However, GAN-based methods are difficult to train, which prevents the hashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash functions. This limitation results in sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the generative cooperative hashing network, which is based on energy-based cooperative learning. This framework jointly learns a powerful generative representation of the data and a robust hash function via two components: a top-down contrastive pair generator that synthesizes contrastive images and a bottom-up multipurpose descriptor that simultaneously represents the images from multiple perspectives, including probability density, hash code, latent code, and category. The two components are jointly learned via a novel likelihood-based cooperative learning scheme. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing supervised methods, achieving up to 10\% relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods, and exhibits a significantly better performance in out-of-distribution retrieval.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Codebook Knowledge with NLI and ChatGPT for Zero-Shot Political Relation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is it possible accurately classify political relations within evolving event ontologies without extensive annotations? This study investigates zero-shot learning methods that use expert knowledge from existing annotation codebook, and evaluates the performance of advanced ChatGPT (GPT-3.5/4) and a natural language inference (NLI)-based model called ZSP. ChatGPT uses codebook's labeled summaries as prompts, whereas ZSP breaks down the classification task into context, event mode, and class disambiguation to refine task-specific hypotheses. This decomposition enhances interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to schema changes. The experiments reveal ChatGPT's strengths and limitations, and crucially show ZSP's outperformance of dictionary-based methods and its competitive edge over some supervised models. These findings affirm the value of ZSP for validating event records and advancing ontology development. Our study underscores the efficacy of leveraging transfer learning and existing domain expertise to enhance research efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>On the Embedding Collapse when Scaling up Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have led to a promising trend of developing large recommendation models to leverage vast amounts of available data. Still, mainstream models remain embarrassingly small in size and na\"ive enlarging does not lead to sufficient performance gain, suggesting a deficiency in the model scalability. In this paper, we identify the embedding collapse phenomenon as the inhibition of scalability, wherein the embedding matrix tends to occupy a low-dimensional subspace. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate a \emph{two-sided effect} of feature interaction specific to recommendation models. On the one hand, interacting with collapsed embeddings restricts embedding learning and exacerbates the collapse issue. On the other hand, interaction is crucial in mitigating the fitting of spurious features as a scalability guarantee. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective multi-embedding design incorporating embedding-set-specific interaction modules to learn embedding sets with large diversity and thus reduce collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this proposed design provides consistent scalability and effective collapse mitigation for various recommendation models. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/Multi-Embedding.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Named Entity Recognition Models for Recipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Food touches our lives through various endeavors, including flavor, nourishment, health, and sustainability. Recipes are cultural capsules transmitted across generations via unstructured text. Automated protocols for recognizing named entities, the building blocks of recipe text, are of immense value for various applications ranging from information extraction to novel recipe generation. Named entity recognition is a technique for extracting information from unstructured or semi-structured data with known labels. Starting with manually-annotated data of 6,611 ingredient phrases, we created an augmented dataset of 26,445 phrases cumulatively. Simultaneously, we systematically cleaned and analyzed ingredient phrases from RecipeDB, the gold-standard recipe data repository, and annotated them using the Stanford NER. Based on the analysis, we sampled a subset of 88,526 phrases using a clustering-based approach while preserving the diversity to create the machine-annotated dataset. A thorough investigation of NER approaches on these three datasets involving statistical, fine-tuning of deep learning-based language models and few-shot prompting on large language models (LLMs) provides deep insights. We conclude that few-shot prompting on LLMs has abysmal performance, whereas the fine-tuned spaCy-transformer emerges as the best model with macro-F1 scores of 95.9%, 96.04%, and 95.71% for the manually-annotated, augmented, and machine-annotated datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>DRAGIN: Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the Information Needs of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm actively decides when and what to retrieve during the text generation process of Large Language Models (LLMs). There are two key elements of this paradigm: identifying the optimal moment to activate the retrieval module (deciding when to retrieve) and crafting the appropriate query once retrieval is triggered (determining what to retrieve). However, current dynamic RAG methods fall short in both aspects. Firstly, the strategies for deciding when to retrieve often rely on static rules. Moreover, the strategies for deciding what to retrieve typically limit themselves to the LLM's most recent sentence or the last few tokens, while the LLM's real-time information needs may span across the entire context. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new framework, DRAGIN, i.e., Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the real-time Information Needs of LLMs. Our framework is specifically designed to make decisions on when and what to retrieve based on the LLM's real-time information needs during the text generation process. We evaluate DRAGIN along with existing methods comprehensively over 4 knowledge-intensive generation datasets. Experimental results show that DRAGIN achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models in GitHub: https://github.com/oneal2000/DRAGIN/tree/main</description>

      <title>BadRAG: Identifying Vulnerabilities in Retrieval Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by outdated information and a tendency to generate incorrect data, commonly referred to as "hallucinations." Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models. This approach involves retrieving relevant information from a large, up-to-date dataset and using it to enhance the generation process, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Despite its benefits, RAG introduces a new attack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced from public data, such as the web. In this paper, we propose \TrojRAG{} to identify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and their indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs). Specifically, we identify that poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval backdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns customized poisoned adversarial queries. Triggers and poisoned passages can be highly customized to implement various attacks. For example, a trigger could be a semantic group like "The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc." Adversarial passages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers but also used to indirectly attack generative LLMs without modifying them. These attacks can include denial-of-service attacks on RAG and semantic steering attacks on LLM generations conditioned by the triggers. Our experiments demonstrate that by just poisoning 10 adversarial passages can induce 98.2\% success rate to retrieve the adversarial passages. Then, these passages can increase the reject ratio of RAG-based GPT-4 from 0.01\% to 74.6\% or increase the rate of negative responses from 0.22\% to 72\% for targeted queries.</description>
