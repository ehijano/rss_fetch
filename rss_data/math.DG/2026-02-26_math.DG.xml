      <title>Diffeological Spaces with a Non-Smooth Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that on certain diffeological spaces there exist linear derivations that satisfy the Leibniz rule but are not smooth with respect to the given diffeology. This reveals that the notion of tangent space defined via all such derivations is strictly larger than the one defined using only smooth derivations, showing that smoothness cannot be recovered from the Leibniz rule alone.</description>

      <title>The Cone of J-Hermitian Matrices and a Geometric Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cone $\mathscr{P}_{\text{J}}$ of positive J-Hermitian matrices associated with an indefinite signature matrix J = $\text{Id}_{p,q}$. We show that the J-exponential map is bijective and use it to analyze the algebraic and geometric structure of $\mathscr{P}_{\text{J}}$. Through a canonical identification with the cone of positive definite matrices, we endow $\mathscr{P}_{\text{J}}$ with a natural Riemannian structure. In this setting, we define a J-geometric mean as the midpoint of geodesics and prove that it is uniquely characterized as the solution of a Riccati-type equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a sequel to arXiv:2506.13656, in which an approach to construct a class of generalized Frobenius manifold structures on the orbit spaces of affine Weyl groups is presented. In this paper we apply this construction to the affine Weyl groups of type $A_\ell, B_\ell, C_\ell$ and $D_\ell$.</description>

      <title>Quadric surfaces of revolution in the 3-sphere as Weingarten surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quadric surfaces of revolution is a cornerstone of classical Euclidean geometry, but its extension to the three-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$ has not been sufficiently explored. This article addresses this important gap by providing a rigorous classification and characterization of non-degenerate quadric surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb{S}^3$, namely spherical ellipsoids, hyperboloids and paraboloids, generated by the rotation of spherical conics around a geodesic axis containing their foci or is orthogonal to them.
  Using the concept of spherical angular momentum as a prominent geometric invariant, we discover that these surfaces constitute a remarkable class of Weingarten surfaces and prove that they are uniquely characterised by a specific cubic functional relation between their principal curvatures. This result not only provides a unified description of spherical quadric surfaces of revolution, but also highlights a profound geometric universality, reflecting exactly the same cubic Weingarten relations observed in their Euclidean and Lorentzian counterparts.</description>

      <title>Llarull type theorems for bands in Three and Four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Llarull's theorem asserts that the scalar curvature and the metric on the $n$-sphere cannot be bounded below at the same time by those of the standard $n$-sphere. Using the warped $\mu$-bubble method, we develop Llarull type theorems for three and four-dimensional bands with spectral scalar curvature bounds.</description>

      <title>Topology of projective Tate-Shafarevich twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Tate-Shafarevich twist $X^\phi\to B$ of a fibration $X\to B$ modifies it by a $1$-cocycle of flows of vector fields relative to the base, locally in the analytic topology. Sacc\`a conjectured that the total spaces of two projective Lagrangian fibrations related by such a twist are deformation-equivalent.
  Assuming that the class of the twist is torsion (which is often equivalent to the twist being realizable in the \'etale topology), we show that there is an isomorphism $H^\ast(X;\mathbb Q)\cong H^\ast(X^\phi;\mathbb Q)$ of graded vector spaces that respects (1) the Hodge structures and (2) the Hodge-Riemann pairing. Consequently, the rational Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki lattices of these two spaces are Hodge-similar.
  Assuming further that $B$ is smooth, that the fibers of the fibrations are reduced outside of a locus of codimension $2$ in $B$, and that the integral homology classes of a general fiber in both spaces are primitive, we show Sacc\`a's conjecture using a recent result of Bogomolov-Kamenova-Verbitsky. We also show that Beauville-Mukai systems for primitive classes satisfy the last condition.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and isoperimetry for continuous metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with quasi-local isoperimetric versions of the positive mass theorem on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense. As a corollary, we derive existence results for isoperimetric sets in such low regularity setting. Our main tool is a new local version of the weak inverse mean curvature flow enjoying $C^0$-stable quantitative estimates.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Variational Flow Matching for Material and Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Riemannian Gaussian Variational Flow Matching (RG-VFM), a geometric extension of Variational Flow Matching (VFM) for generative modeling on manifolds. Motivated by the benefits of VFM, we derive a variational flow matching objective for manifolds with closed-form geodesics based on Riemannian Gaussian distributions. Crucially, in Euclidean space, predicting endpoints (VFM), velocities (FM), or noise (diffusion) is largely equivalent due to affine interpolations. However, on curved manifolds this equivalence breaks down. We formally analyze the relationship between our model and Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), revealing that the RFM objective lacks a curvature-dependent penalty -- encoded via Jacobi fields -- that is naturally present in RG-VFM. Based on this relationship, we hypothesize that endpoint prediction provides a stronger learning signal by directly minimizing geodesic distances. Experiments on synthetic spherical and hyperbolic benchmarks, as well as real-world tasks in material and protein generation, demonstrate that RG-VFM more effectively captures manifold structure and improves downstream performance over Euclidean and velocity-based baselines.

      <title>Exploring a New Design Paradigm for Omnidirectional MAVs for Minimal Actuation and Internal Force Elimination: Theoretical Framework and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept for achieving omnidirectionality in a multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) that uses only 6 inputs and ensures no internal forces at the equilibria. The concept integrates a single actively-tilting propeller along with 3 pendulum-like links, each carrying a propeller,connected by passive universal joints to the main body. We show that this design ensures omnidirectionality while minimizing the internal forces and without resorting to overactuation (i.e.,more than 6 inputs). A detailed dynamic model of the multi-link MAV is first developed. Afterwards, the analysis identifies the equilibrium configurations and illustrates that a forced equilibrium exists for every pose of the MAV's main platform. In order to render this equilibrium asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system, a coordinate-invariant nonlinear controller is constructed using dynamic feedback linearization and backstepping techniques with the main platform configuration error being the left-trivialized error on SE(3). The stability of the closed-loop system is then investigated by employing standard Lyapunov arguments on the zero dynamics. We conclude by providing numerical Gazebo simulations validating our approach. They demonstrate the MAV capability to perform decoupled attitude and translational motions under parametric uncertainty and actuators noise.</description>
