      <title>Generalized torsion elements in infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group element is called generalized torsion if a finite product of its conjugates is equal to the identity. We show that in a finitely generated abelian-by-finite group, an element is generalized torsion if and only if its image in the abelianization is torsion. We also prove a quantitative version with sharp bounds to the generalized exponent of these groups. In particular, we provide many examples of finitely presentable torsion-free groups in which all elements are generalized torsion. We also discuss positive generalized identities in abelian-by-finite groups and related classes.</description>

      <title>On non self-normalizing subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a non negative integer, and define $D_n$ to be the family of all finite groups having precisely $n$ conjugacy classes of nontrivial subgroups that are not self-normalizing. We are interested in studying the behavior of $D_n$ and its interplay with solvability and nilpotency. We first show that if $G$ belongs to $D_n$ with $n \le 3$, then $G$ is solvable of derived length at most 2. We also show that $A_5$ is the unique nonsolvable group in $D_4$, and that $SL_2(3)$ is the unique solvable group in $D_4$ whose derived length is larger than 2. For a group $G$, we define $D(G)$ to be the number of conjugacy classes of nontrivial subgroups that are not self-normalizing. We determine the relationship between $D(H \times K)$ and $D(H)$ and $D(K)$. We show that if $G$ is nilpotent and lies in $D_n$, then $G$ has nilpotency class at most $n/2$ and its derived length is at most $\log_2 (n/2) + 1$. We consider $D_n$ for several classes of Frobenius groups, and we use this classification to classify the groups in $D_0$, $D_1$, $D_2$, and $D_3$. Finally, we show that if $G$ is solvable and lies in $D_n$ with $n \ge 3$, then $G$ has derived length at most the minimum of $n-1$ and $3 \log_2 (n+1) + 9$.</description>

      <title>Derived length of stabilizers in finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We study partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have bounded derived length, proving the following three theorems. In every solvable permutation group, there is a subset whose setwise stabilizer has derived length at most $3$, which is best possible. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length bounded by an absolute constant. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose pointwise stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>Nil 3-manifolds and cusps of complex hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: McReynolds showed that every compact Nil 3-manifold occurs as the cusp cross-section of some arithmetic complex hyperbolic 2-manifold. We classify which commensurability classes of cusped, arithmetic, complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds admit cusps with cross-section homeomorphic to a given compact Nil 3-manifold. In particular, there are some Nil 3-manifolds which occur as cusps in every such commensurability class, and some which only occur in a single commensurability class. We also show that every compact Nil 3-manifold occurs as the cusp cross-section of some non-arithmetic complex hyperbolic 2-manifold.</description>

      <title>CAT(0) geometry of complex curve complements and families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of whether braid groups are CAT(0), we investigate the CAT(0) behavior of fundamental groups of plane curve complements and certain universal families. If $C$ is the branch locus of a generic projection of a smooth, complete intersection surface to $\PP^2$, we show that $\pi_1(\PP^2\setminus C)$ is CAT(0). In the other direction, we prove that the fundamental group of the universal family associated with the singularities of type $E_6$, $E_7$, and $E_8$ is not CAT(0).</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Infinitary Logic and Absolute co-Hopfianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Paolini and Shelah have constructed absolutely Hopfian torsion-free abelian groups of any given size. In contrast, we show that this is not necessarily the case for absolutely co-Hopfian groups. We use the infinitary logic to show that there are no absolute co-Hopfian abelian groups above the first beautiful cardinal. An extension of this result to the category of modules over a commutative ring is given.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity-free representations of the principal A1-subgroup in a simple algebraic group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a simple algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p&gt;0. Here we classify all irreducible kG-modules for which the principal A1 has no repeated composition factors, extending the work of Liebeck-Seitz-Testerman which treated the same question when k is replaced by an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Geometrical finiteness for automorphism groups via cone conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish the geometrical finiteness for the natural isometric actions of (birational) automorphism groups on the hyperbolic spaces for K3 surfaces, Enriques surfaces, Coble surfaces, and irreducible symplectic varieties.
  As an application, it follows that such groups are non-positively curved: ${\rm CAT(0)}$ and relatively hyperbolic. In the case of K3 surfaces, we provide a dynamical characterization of relative hyperbolicity, and clarify the relationship between convex-cocompactness and genus one fibrations.</description>

      <title>Periodic colorings and orientations in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of periodic colorings and orientations in locally finite graphs. A coloring or orientation of a graph $G$ is periodic if the resulting colored or oriented graph is quasi-transitive, meaning that $V(G)$ has finitely many orbits under the action of the group of automorphisms of $G$ preserving the coloring or the orientation. When such a periodic coloring or orientation of $G$ exists, $G$ itself must be quasi-transitive and it is natural to investigate when quasi-transitive graphs have such periodic colorings or orientations. We provide examples of Cayley graphs with no periodic orientation or non-trivial coloring, and examples of quasi-transitive graphs of treewidth 2 without periodic orientation or proper coloring. On the other hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth has a periodic proper coloring with $\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic orientation. We relate these problems with techniques and questions from symbolic dynamics and distributed computing and conclude with a number of open problems.</description>
