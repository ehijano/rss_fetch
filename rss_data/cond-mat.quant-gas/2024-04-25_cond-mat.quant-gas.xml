      <title>Transverse Quantum Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even when ideal solids are insulating, their states with crystallographic defects may have superfluid properties. It became clear recently that edge dislocations in $^4$He featuring a combination of microscopic quantum roughness and superfluidity of their cores may represent a new paradigmatic class of quasi-one-dimensional superfluids. The new state of matter, termed transverse quantum fluid (TQF), is found in a variety of physical setups. The key ingredient defining the class of TQF systems is infinite compressibility, which is responsible for all other unusual properties such as the quadratic spectrum (or even the absence) of normal modes, irrelevance of the Landau criterion, off-diagonal long-range order at $T = 0$, and the exponential dependence of the phase slip probability on the inverse flow velocity. From a conceptual point of view, the TQF state is a striking demonstration of the conditional character of many dogmas associated with superfluidity, including the necessity of elementary excitations, in general, and the ones obeying Landau criterion in particular.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Conformal Symmetry in the Dynamics of Quantum Gases: A Cyclic Quantum State and Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal symmetry heavily constrains the dynamics of non-relativistic quantum gases tuned to a nearby quantum critical point. One important consequence of this symmetry is that entropy production can be absent in far away from equilibrium dynamics of strongly interacting three-dimensional (3D) and one-dimensional (1D) quantum gases placed inside a soft harmonic trapping potential. This can lead to an oscillatory fully revivable many-body dynamic state, which is reflected in many physical observables. In this article we further investigate the consequences of conformal symmetry on a) the zero-temperature auto-correlation function, b) the Wigner distribution function, and c) the Von Neumann entanglement entropy. A direct calculation of these quantities for generic strongly interacting systems is usually extremely difficult. However, we have derived the general structures of these functions in the non-equilibrium dynamics when their dynamics are constrained by conformal symmetry. We obtain our results for a) by utilizing an operator-state correspondence which connects the imaginary time evolution of primary operators to different initial states of harmonically trapped gases. While the dynamics of the functions in b) and c) are derived from conformal invariant density matrices.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced resonance from the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confinement-induced resonances for trapped bosons in the cigar-shaped and pancake geometries are studied within the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equations, which are a simplified version of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. Although the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method is considered applicable only for small interparticle interactions, the resonance denominators for the chemical potential are obtained in both quasi-one and quasi-two dimensions. A useful integral representation of the one-particle Green's function are found for the cylindrical confinement. We find the position of a smoothed resonance for the chemical potential in the pancake geometry at positive scattering length.</description>

      <title>SU(N) magnetism with ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal order parameter of pair superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the normal superfluid phase.</description>

      <title>Path integral approach to bosonisation and nonlinearities in exciton-polariton systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large exciton-polariton optical nonlinearities present a key mechanism for photonics-based communication, ultimately in the quantum regime. Enhanced nonlinear response from various materials hosting excitons and allowing for their strong coupling with light is therefore the topic of intense studies, both in theoretical and experimental domains. Reports on the scattering rates arising due to various system's nonlinearities, such as the exciton-exciton Coulomb interaction and the Pauli blocking that leads to the saturation of the exciton oscillator strength, however, are contradictory. In this work, we develop a formalism allowing to track the exciton nonlinearities appearing in the regime of strong coupling with photons, that includes finite temperatures, mixing of the exciton excited states, and the dark exciton contributions to saturation self-consistently. The equilibrium path integration approach employed here to address the polariton composite nature, leads to a transparent hierarchy of various contributions to nonlinearity. At the same time, by taking the simplest limit of zero temperature and so-called "rigid" excitons, through our framework we retrieve the expressions derived in conventional approaches for exciton interaction constants. In particular, our theory allows to clearly show that such interaction constants cannot be used as fitting parameters tunable in a wide range of values, as they are strictly defined by the material properties, and that other explanations are due for large optical nonlinearities recently reported.</description>

      <title>Amplitude, phase, and topological fluctuations shaping the complex phase diagram of two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the Ginzburg-Landau order parameter for superconductors in two spatial dimensions. Starting from the mean-field critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}0}$, we calculate the beyond-mean-field critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ by including thermal fluctuations of the order parameter within the Gaussian level. Moreover, from our beyond-mean field results, we derive the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$, which takes into account topological vortex-antivortex excitations in the phase fluctuations as well as the amplitude fluctuations, to obtain the shifts of transition temperatures. We elucidate how the Gaussian thermal fluctuations and phase fluctuations associated with vortex excitations affect thermodynamic properties by determining the $H$-$T$ phase diagram for a type-II superconductor and computing the critical behaviors of the heat capacity, which are experimentally accessible, allowing the characterization of the cascade of different kinds of fluctuations in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Partial Renormalization of Quasiparticle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal effective interactions are inherent to non-relativistic quantum many-body systems, but their systematic resummation poses a significant challenge known as the ``vertex problem" in many-body perturbation theory. We introduce a renormalization scheme based on a projection-based renormalization condition that selectively resums the most essential nonlocal contributions to the effective interaction vertex, avoiding the computational complexity of the full vertex function. This enables us to derive a renormalized Feynman diagrammatic series with large parameters canceled by counter-diagrams, efficiently generated using a perturbative expansion of the parquet equations and computed using a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying our approach to a 3D Yukawa Fermi liquid, we demonstrate that the renormalized perturbation theory remains predictive even in the strongly correlated regime and uncover significant sign cancellations between different channels contributing to the scattering amplitude. Our work establishes a novel framework for investigating strong correlations in quantum many-body systems, offering a systematic approach to explore nonlocal theories for challenging systems like the electron liquid in material science.</description>

      <title>Confinement in 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theories at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confinement is a paradigmatic phenomenon of gauge theories, and its understanding lies at the forefront of high-energy physics. Here, we study confinement in a simple one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and filling, which is within the reach of current cold-atom and superconducting-qubit platforms. By employing matrix product states (MPS) calculations, we investigate the decay of the finite-temperature Green's function and uncover a smooth crossover between the confined and deconfined regimes. Furthermore, using the Friedel oscillations and string length distributions obtained from snapshots sampled from MPS, both of which are experimentally readily available, we verify that confined mesons remain well-defined at arbitrary finite temperature. This phenomenology is further supported by probing quench dynamics of mesons with exact diagonalization. Our results shed new light on confinement at finite temperature from an experimentally relevant standpoint.</description>

      <title>Amorphous quantum magnets in a two-dimensional Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous solids, i.e., systems which feature well-defined short-range properties but lack long-range order, constitute an important research topic in condensed matter. While their microscopic structure is known to differ from their crystalline counterpart, there are still many open questions concerning the emergent collective behavior in amorphous materials. This is particularly the case in the quantum regime, where the numerical simulations are extremely challenging. In this article, we instead propose to explore amorphous quantum magnets with an analog quantum simulator. To this end, we first present an algorithm to generate amorphous quantum magnets, suitable for Rydberg simulators of the Ising model. Subsequently, we use semiclassical approaches to get a preliminary insight of the physics of the model. In particular, for ferromagnetic interactions, we calculate mean-field phase diagrams, and use the linear-spin-wave theory to study localization properties and dynamical structure factors of the excitations. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we show that amorphous magnets exhibit a complex classical energy landscape by means of simulated annealing. Finally, we outline an experimental proposal based on Rydberg atoms in programmable tweezer arrays, thus opening the road towards the study of amorphous quantum magnets in regimes difficult to simulate classically.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>
