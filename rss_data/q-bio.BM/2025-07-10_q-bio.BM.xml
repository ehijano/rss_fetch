      <title>Targeting Melanoma-Specific Tyrosinase: Cyclic Peptide Disrupts Actin Dynamics for Precision Apoptosis Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive and highly metastatic cancer that exhibits stubborn resistance to conventional therapies, highlighting the need for novel treatments. Existing therapeutic strategies often suffer from systemic toxicity, poor efficacy and fast-gained drug resistance. In this study, we designed a cyclic peptide system (c-RGDKYQ) that takes the advantage of the overexpression of tyrosinase in melanoma cells to trigger enzyme-mediated oxidation and self-assembly. The assembled peptide nanostructures can selectively disrupt the actin cytoskeleton, impairing cancer cellular functions, e.g., motility, adhesion, and proliferation, ultimately leading to apoptosis. This approach does not rely on external drug payloads or complex delivery mechanisms. c-RGDKYQ exhibits high selectivity for melanoma cells, strongly suppressing tumor growth in a murine model with minimal systemic toxicity. Our findings illuminate that, through targeting tyrosinase, c-RGDKYQ may be an enzyme-responsive alternative to conventional treatments for melanoma.</description>

      <title>DecoyDB: A Dataset for Graph Contrastive Learning in Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning, especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes. However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal (negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Automated Neuron Labelling Enables Generative Steering and Interpretability in Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) encode rich biological information, yet their internal neuron representations are poorly understood. We introduce the first automated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically grounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on sparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of thousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to diverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron activation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits, enabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and instability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs, including alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers. We finally show that analysis of labeled neurons in different model sizes reveals PLM scaling laws and a structured neuron space distribution.</description>

      <title>DeepRetro: Retrosynthetic Pathway Discovery using Iterative LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.</description>

      <title>The optimization of crop response to climatic stress through modulation of plant stress response mechanisms. Opportunities for biostimulants and plant hormones to meet climate challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.</description>

      <title>Tokenization for Molecular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-based foundation models have become an important part of scientific discovery, with molecular foundation models accelerating advancements in material science and molecular design.However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers that capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate 34 tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, and reveal significant gaps in their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by pretraining and finetuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. The proposed tokenizers systematically integrate nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; facilitating applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics.</description>

      <title>Pullback Flow Matching on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Pullback Flow Matching (PFM), a novel framework for generative modeling on data manifolds. Unlike existing methods that assume or learn restrictive closed-form manifold mappings for training Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM) models, PFM leverages pullback geometry and isometric learning to preserve the underlying manifold's geometry while enabling efficient generation and precise interpolation in latent space. This approach not only facilitates closed-form mappings on the data manifold but also allows for designable latent spaces, using assumed metrics on both data and latent manifolds. By enhancing isometric learning through Neural ODEs and proposing a scalable training objective, we achieve a latent space more suitable for interpolation, leading to improved manifold learning and generative performance. We demonstrate PFM's effectiveness through applications in synthetic data, protein dynamics and protein sequence data, generating novel proteins with specific properties. This method shows strong potential for drug discovery and materials science, where generating novel samples with specific properties is of great interest.</description>
