      <title>A unified relativistic path integral origin for noise-activated collapse and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativity and quantum mechanics are two cornerstones of modern physics, yet their unification within a single-particle path integral and a dynamical account of quantum measurement remain unresolved. Here we show that these puzzles are linked. We construct a relativistic path integral that, from a single action principle, recovers the Dirac, Klein-Gordon, and Schr\"odinger equations, while also exposing a latent nonlocal term in the propagator. This term dormant in differentiable potentials but is activated by non-differentiable noise, driving outcome probabilities through bounded-martingale stochastic process. In this regime, the pointer basis emerges as absorbing boundaries, Born's rule arises from first-passage statistics, and collapse occurs in finite, parameter-dependent time, thereby reducing measurement axioms to dynamical consequences. Crucially, our work recovers the standard GKSL master equation by averaging over the stochastic record, and thus provides a first-principles foundation for decoherence. Because the trigger is the noise spectrum, our work shows that engineering ``colored'' noise can expedite or steer collapse, suggesting practical routes to fast qubit reset, preserved coherence, and quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Resolution-Scale Relativity signatures in the orbital periods of extra-solar planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolution-Scale Relativity suggests quantum-like dynamics may emerge in chaotic macroscopic systems. In planetary systems, this would lead to orbital periods being proportional to cubed integers $n$. Each system is then characterized by a fundamental speed corresponding to orbital $n=1$. Fitting this model to data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive for 115 planetary systems with four or more planets leads to identifying 38 systems (33\%) complying with an accuracy such that the null hypothesis accidental probability is less than $10^{-2}$, and 16 (14\%) with less than $10^{-3}$. Additionally, 34 systems (29\%) follow a pattern of consecutive quantum-like integer numbers, and 101 (88\%) in which at least half of the quantum-like numbers are part of consecutive sequences. The distribution of fundamental speeds extends from $\sim 100\,\rm km/s$ to more than $1,200\,\rm km/s$ and can be described in terms of a few peaks centered on integer multiple of a super-fundamental speed $v_0=(218.0\pm4.7)\,\rm km/s$. These results along side with other observations in turbulent fluid dynamics amount to a shift to a higher gear in the search for macro-quantization effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling in SO(3,1)$\times$SO(4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2586</link>
      <description>arXiv:1411.2586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We supplement the Lorentz transformation $L(v)$ with a new ``Tunneling" transformation $T(v)$. Application of this new operation to elementary quantum mechanics offers a novel, intuitive insight into the nature of quantum tunneling; in particular, the so-called ``Klein Paradox" is discussed.</description>

      <title>Weyl Spinors with Proto-charges: A Substructure Model for Elementary Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a conceptual overview of a new substructure model of elementary particles, motivated in part by the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula. In this approach, Weyl spinors endowed with proto-charges generate all known elementary fermions via their conjugate pairs, while bosons arise naturally as composites. The model predicts a new class of massive neutral bosons that serve as dark matter candidates, accounts for the existence of three generations of fermions, and reproduces the SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) symmetry as a low-energy limit. Elementary particles acquire effective masses from internal binding energy, eliminating the need for ad hoc Yukawa couplings. Neutrinos emerge only in left-handed states, gain mass through their substructure rather than chirality mixing. From the simple proposition that elementary particles are Weyl spinors with proto-charges emerges a coherent and comprehensive picture of elementary particles and fields. Experimental implications of the model includes: no proton decay, absence of sterile neutrinos, absence of Majorana neutrinos, and a possible detection of new massive neutral bosons as dark matter.</description>
