      <title>Randomized Rank-Structured Matrix Compression by Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present novel randomized compression algorithms for flat rank-structured matrices with shared bases, known as uniform Block Low-Rank (BLR) matrices. Our main contribution is a technique called tagging, which improves upon the efficiency of basis matrix computation while preserving accuracy compared to alternative methods. Tagging operates on the matrix using matrix-vector products of the matrix and its adjoint, making it particularly advantageous in scenarios where accessing individual matrix entries is computationally expensive or infeasible.
  Flat rank-structured formats use subblock sizes that asymptotically scale with the matrix size to ensure competitive complexities for linear algebraic operations, making alternative methods prohibitively expensive in such scenarios. In contrast, tagging reconstructs basis matrices using a constant number of matrix-vector products followed by linear post-processing, with the constants determined by the rank parameter and the problem's underlying geometric properties.
  We provide a detailed analysis of the asymptotic complexity of tagging, demonstrating its ability to significantly reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. We also establish a theoretical connection between the optimal construction of tagging matrices and projective varieties in algebraic geometry, suggesting a hybrid numeric-symbolic avenue of future work.
  To validate our approach, we apply tagging to compress uniform BLR matrices arising from the discretization of integral and partial differential equations. Empirical results show that tagging outperforms alternative compression techniques, significantly reducing both the number of required matrix-vector products and overall computational time. These findings highlight the practicality and scalability of tagging as an efficient method for flat rank-structured matrices in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Learned Discrepancy Reconstruction and Benchmark Dataset for Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an emerging imaging modality based on the magnetic response of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to achieve high-resolution and real-time imaging without harmful radiation. One key challenge in the MPI image reconstruction task arises from its underlying noise model, which does not fulfill the implicit Gaussian assumptions that are made when applying traditional reconstruction approaches. To address this challenge, we introduce the Learned Discrepancy Approach, a novel learning-based reconstruction method for inverse problems that includes a learned discrepancy function. It enhances traditional techniques by incorporating an invertible neural network to explicitly model problem-specific noise distributions. This approach does not rely on implicit Gaussian noise assumptions, making it especially suited to handle the sophisticated noise model in MPI and also applicable to other inverse problems. To further advance MPI reconstruction techniques, we introduce the MPI-MNIST dataset - a large collection of simulated MPI measurements derived from the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset includes noise-perturbed measurements generated from state-of-the-art model-based system matrices and measurements of a preclinical MPI scanner device. This provides a realistic and flexible environment for algorithm testing. Validated against the MPI-MNIST dataset, our method demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction quality in terms of structural similarity when compared to classical reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>Space-time isogeometric method for a linear fourth order time dependent problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the space-time isogeometric method for a linear time dependent fourth order problem. Using an auxiliary variable, first the problem is split into a system of two second order differential equations and then the system is discretized by employing the tensor product spline spaces of time and spatial variables. We use the Babuska's theorem to prove the well-posedness of the continuous variational formulation. Also, the inf-sup stability condition at discrete level is established, which we use to prove the error estimates for the proposed method. Finally, to demonstrate the convergence of the scheme, few numerical results are reported.</description>

      <title>Stable and high-order accurate finite difference methods for the diffusive viscous wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusive viscous wave equation describes wave propagation in diffusive and viscous media. Examples include seismic waves traveling through the Earth's crust, taking into account of both the elastic properties of rocks and the dissipative effects due to internal friction and viscosity; acoustic waves propagating through biological tissues, where both elastic and viscous effects play a significant role. We propose a stable and high-order finite difference method for solving the governing equations. By designing the spatial discretization with the summation-by-parts property, we prove stability by deriving a discrete energy estimate. In addition, we derive error estimates for problems with constant coefficients using the normal mode analysis and for problems with variable coefficients using the energy method. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the stability and accuracy properties of the developed method.</description>

      <title>A positivity-preserving, second-order energy stable and convergent numerical scheme for a ternary system of macromolecular microsphere composite hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A second order accurate numerical scheme is proposed and analyzed for the periodic three-component Macromolecular Microsphere Composite(MMC) hydrogels system, a ternary Cahn-Hilliard system with a Flory-Huggins-deGennes free energy potential. This numerical scheme with energy stability is based on the Backward Differentiation Formula(BDF) method in time derivation combining with Douglas-Dupont regularization term, combined the finite difference method in space. We provide a theoretical justification of positivity-preserving property for all the singular terms, i.e., not only the two phase variables are always between $0$ and $1$, but also the sum of the two phase variables is between $0$ and $1$, at a point-wise level. In addition, an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided in this paper, in which a higher order asymptotic expansion of the numerical solution, the rough error estimate and refined error estimate techniques have to be included to accomplish such an analysis. This paper will be the first to combine the following theoretical properties for a second order accurate numerical scheme for the ternary MMC system: (i) unique solvability and positivity-preserving property; (ii) energy stability; (iii) and optimal rate convergence. A few numerical results are also presented.</description>

      <title>Numerical entropy production in finite volume ADER schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whenever we deal with conservation laws, uniqueness of weak solutions can be guaranteed by the entropy inequality, which derives from the physical entropy. We study the residual of this inequality, which represents the numerical entropy production by the approximation scheme we are considering. This idea has been introduced and exploited in Runge Kutta finite volume methods, where the numerical entropy production has been used as an indicator in adaptive schemes, since it scales as the local truncation error of the method for smooth solutions and it highlights the presence of discontinuities and their kind.
  The aim of this work is to extend this idea to ADER timestepping techniques. We show that the numerical entropy production can be defined also in this context and it provides a scalar quantity computable for each spacetime volume which, under grid refinement, decays to zero with the same rate of convergence of the scheme for smooth solutions it's bounded on contact discontinuities and divergent on shock waves. Theoretical results are proven in a multidimensional setting. We also present numerical evidence showing that it is essentially negative definite. Moreover, we propose an adaptive scheme that uses the numerical entropy production as smoothness indicator. The scheme locally modifies its order of convergence with the purpose of removing the oscillations due to the high-order of accuracy of the scheme.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Direct Approximation of Derivatives in Rational Radial Basis Functions Partition of Unity Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Direct Rational Radial Basis Functions Partition of Unity (D-RRBF-PU) approach to compute derivatives of functions with steep gradients or discontinuities. The novelty of the method concerns how derivatives are approximated. More precisely, all derivatives of the partition of unity weight functions are eliminated while we compute the derivatives of the local rational approximants in each patch. As a result, approximate derivatives are obtained more easily and quickly than those obtained in the standard formulation. The corresponding error bounds are briefly discussed. Some numerical results are presented to show the technique's potential.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider numerical approximation of an electrically conductive ferrofluid model, which consists of Navier-Stokes equations, magnetization equation, and magnetic induction equation. To solve this highly coupled, nonlinear, and multiphysics system efficiently, we develop a decoupled, linear, second-order in time, and unconditionally energy stable finite element scheme. We incorporate several distinct numerical techniques, including reformulations of the equations and a scalar auxiliary variable to handle the coupled nonlinear terms,a symmetric implicit-explicit treatment for the symmetric positive definite nonlinearity, and stable finite element approximations. We also prove that the numerical scheme is provably uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable rigorously. A series of numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and performance of our scheme.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Tensor Product Functions in Representing Antisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor product function (TPF) approximations have been widely adopted in solving high-dimensional problems, such as partial differential equations and eigenvalue problems, achieving desirable accuracy with computational overhead that scales linearly with problem dimensions. However, recent studies have underscored the extraordinarily high computational cost of TPFs on quantum many-body problems, even for systems with as few as three particles. A key distinction in these problems is the antisymmetry requirement on the unknown functions. In the present work, we rigorously establish that the minimum number of involved terms for a class of TPFs to be exactly antisymmetric increases exponentially fast with the problem dimension. This class encompasses both traditionally discretized TPFs and the recent ones parameterized by neural networks. Our proof exploits the link between the antisymmetric TPFs in this class and the corresponding antisymmetric tensors and focuses on the Canonical Polyadic rank of the latter. As a result, our findings uncover a fundamental incompatibility between antisymmetry and low-rank TPFs in high-dimensional contexts and offer new insights for further developments.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition strategy for natural imposition of mixed boundary conditions in port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, a finite element scheme to impose mixed boundary conditions without introducing Lagrange multipliers is presented for wave propagation phenomena described as port-Hamiltonian systems. The strategy relies on finite element exterior calculus and a domain decomposition to interconnect two systems with different causalities. The spatial domain is split into two parts by introducing an arbitrary interface. Each subdomain is discretized with a mixed finite element formulation that introduces a uniform boundary condition in a natural way as the input. In each subdomain the spaces are selected from a finite element subcomplex to obtain a stable discretization. The two systems are then interconnected together by making use of a feedback interconnection. This is achieved by discretizing the boundary inputs using appropriate spaces that couple the two formulations. The final systems includes all boundary conditions explicitly and does not contain any Lagrange multiplier. Each subdomain is integrated using an implicit midpoint scheme in an uncoupled way from the other by means of a leapfrog scheme. The proposed strategy is tested on three different examples: the Euler-Bernoulli beam, the wave equation and the Maxwell equations. Numerical tests assess the conservation properties of the scheme and the effectiveness of the methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores backward error analysis for numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations, particularly focusing on chaotic systems. Three approaches are examined: residual assessment, the method of modified equations, and shadowing. We investigate how these methods explain the success of numerical simulations in capturing the behavior of chaotic systems, even when facing issues like spurious chaos introduced by numerical methods or suppression of chaos by numerical methods. Finally, we point out an open problem, namely to explain why the statistics of long orbits are usually correct, even though we do not have a theoretical guarantee why this should be so.</description>

      <title>Low-rank variance reduction for uncertain radiative transfer with control variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation models various physical processes ranging from plasma simulations to radiation therapy. In practice, these phenomena are often subject to uncertainties. Modeling and propagating these uncertainties requires accurate and efficient solvers for the radiative transfer equations. Due to the equation's high-dimensional phase space, fine-grid solutions of the radiative transfer equation are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. In recent years, dynamical low-rank approximation has become a popular method for solving kinetic equations due to the development of computationally inexpensive, memory-efficient and robust algorithms like the augmented basis update \&amp; Galerkin integrator. In this work, we propose a low-rank Monte Carlo estimator and combine it with a control variate strategy based on multi-fidelity low-rank approximations for variance reduction. We investigate the error analytically and numerically and find that a joint approach to balance rank and grid size is necessary. Numerical experiments further show that the efficiency of estimators can be improved using dynamical low-rank approximation, especially in the context of control variates.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Weight Window Techniques for Time-Dependent Monte Carlo Neutronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient variance reduction of Monte Carlo simulations is desirable to avoid wasting computational resources. This paper presents an automated weight window algorithm for solving time-dependent particle transport problems. The weight window centers are defined by a hybrid forward solution of the discretized low-order second moment (LOSM) problem. The second-moment (SM) functionals defining the closure for the LOSM equations are computed by Monte Carlo solution. A filtering algorithm is applied to reduce noise in the SM functionals. The LOSM equations are discretized with first- and second-order time integration methods. We present numerical results of the AZURV1 benchmark. The hybrid weight windows lead to a uniform distribution of Monte Carlo particles in space. This causes a more accurate resolution of wave fronts and regions with relatively low flux.</description>

      <title>A second-order dynamical low-rank mass-lumped finite element method for the Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel second-order dynamical low-rank mass-lumped finite element method for solving the Allen-Cahn (AC) equation, a semilinear parabolic partial differential equation. The matrix differential equation of the semi-discrete mass-lumped finite element scheme is decomposed into linear and nonlinear components using the second-order Strang splitting method. The linear component is solved analytically within a low-rank manifold, while the nonlinear component is discretized using a second-order augmented basis update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrator, in which the $S$-step matrix equation is solved by the explicit 2-stage strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method. The algorithm has lower computational complexity than the full-rank mass-lump finite element method. The dynamical low-rank finite element solution is shown to conserve mass up to a truncation tolerance for the conservative Allen-Cahn equation. Meanwhile, the modified energy is dissipative up to a high-order error and is hence stable. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results. Symmetry-preserving tests highlight the robustness of the proposed method for long-time simulations and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Approximate well-balanced WENO finite difference schemes using a global-flux quadrature method with multi-step ODE integrator weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, high-order discrete well-balanced methods for one-dimensional hyperbolic systems of balance laws are proposed. We aim to construct a method whose discrete steady states correspond to solutions of arbitrary high-order ODE integrators. However, this property is embedded directly into the scheme, eliminating the need to apply the ODE integrator explicitly to solve the local Cauchy problem. To achieve this, we employ a WENO finite difference framework and apply WENO reconstruction to a global flux assembled nodewise as the sum of the physical flux and a source primitive. The novel idea is to compute the source primitive using high-order multi-step ODE methods applied on the finite difference grid. This approach provides a locally well-balanced splitting of the source integral, with weights derived from the ODE integrator. By construction, the discrete solutions of the proposed schemes align with those of the underlying ODE integrator. The proposed methods employ WENO flux reconstructions of varying orders, combined with multi-step ODE methods of up to order 8, achieving steady-state accuracy determined solely by the ODE method's consistency. Numerical experiments using scalar balance laws and shallow water equations confirm that the methods achieve optimal convergence for time-dependent solutions and significant error reduction for steady-state solutions.</description>

      <title>Averaged Adam accelerates stochastic optimization in the training of deep neural network approximations for partial differential equation and optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06081</link>

Abstract: Deep learning methods - usually consisting of a class of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays omnipresent in data-driven learning problems as well as in scientific computing tasks such as optimal control (OC) and partial differential equation (PDE) problems. In practically relevant learning tasks, often not the plain-vanilla standard SGD optimization method is employed to train the considered class of DNNs but instead more sophisticated adaptive and accelerated variants of the standard SGD method such as the popular Adam optimizer are used. Inspired by the classical Polyak-Ruppert averaging approach, in this work we apply averaged variants of the Adam optimizer to train DNNs to approximately solve exemplary scientific computing problems in the form of PDEs and OC problems. We test the averaged variants of Adam in a series of learning problems including physics-informed neural network (PINN), deep backward stochastic differential equation (deep BSDE), and deep Kolmogorov approximations for PDEs (such as heat, Black-Scholes, Burgers, and Allen-Cahn PDEs), including DNN approximations for OC problems, and including DNN approximations for image classification problems (ResNet for CIFAR-10). In each of the numerical examples the employed averaged variants of Adam outperform the standard Adam and the standard SGD optimizers, particularly, in the situation of the scientific machine learning problems. The Python source codes for the numerical experiments associated to this work can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/deeplearningmethods/averaged-adam.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Approach to Fractional Analysis for Non-Linear Coupled Thermo-Elastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear thermoelastic systems play a crucial role in understanding thermal conductivity, stresses, elasticity, and temperature interactions. This research focuses on finding solutions to these systems in their fractional forms, which is a significant aspect of the study. We consider various proposed models related to fractional thermoelasticity and derive results through sophisticated methodologies. Numerical simulations are conducted for both fractional and integer order thermoelastic coupled systems, with results presented in tables and graphs. The graphs indicate a close correspondence between the approximate and exact solutions. The solutions obtained demonstrate convergence for both fractional and integer order problems, ensuring accurate modeling. Furthermore, the tables confirm that greater accuracy can be achieved by increasing the number of terms in the series of solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport-inspired Deep Learning Framework for Slow-Decaying Kolmogorov n-width Problems: Exploiting Sinkhorn Loss and Wasserstein Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) are widely used in scientific computing to tackle high-dimensional systems. However, traditional ROM methods may only partially capture the intrinsic geometric characteristics of the data. These characteristics encompass the underlying structure, relationships, and essential features crucial for accurate modeling.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel ROM framework that integrates optimal transport (OT) theory and neural network-based methods. Specifically, we investigate the Kernel Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (kPOD) method exploiting the Wasserstein distance as the custom kernel, and we efficiently train the resulting neural network (NN) employing the Sinkhorn algorithm. By leveraging an OT-based nonlinear reduction, the presented framework can capture the geometric structure of the data, which is crucial for accurate learning of the reduced solution manifold. When compared with traditional metrics such as mean squared error or cross-entropy, exploiting the Sinkhorn divergence as the loss function enhances stability during training, robustness against overfitting and noise, and accelerates convergence.
  To showcase the approach's effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a set of challenging test cases exhibiting a slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width. The results show that our framework outperforms traditional ROM methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A fitted space-time finite element method for an advection-diffusion problem with moving interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a space-time interface-fitted finite element method for solving a parabolic advection-diffusion problem with a nonstationary interface. The jumping diffusion coefficient gives rise to the discontinuity of the solution gradient across the interface. We use the Banach-Necas-Babuska theorem to show the well-posedness of the continuous variational problem. A fully discrete finite-element based scheme is analyzed using the Galerkin method and unstructured interface-fitted meshes. An optimal error estimate is established in a discrete energy norm under a globally low but locally high regularity condition. Some numerical results corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, bounds and extrapolation of Block-Gauss and Gauss-Radau quadrature for computing $B^T \phi (A) B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore quadratures for the evaluation of $B^T \phi(A) B$ where $A$ is a symmetric positive-definite (s.p.d.) matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $B$ is a tall matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, and $\phi(\cdot)$ represents a matrix function that is regular enough in the neighborhood of $A$'s spectrum, e.g., a Stieltjes or exponential function. These formulations, for example, commonly arise in the computation of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transfer functions for diffusion PDEs.
  We propose an approximation scheme for $B^T \phi(A) B$ leveraging the block Lanczos algorithm and its equivalent representation through Stieltjes matrix continued fractions. We extend the notion of Gauss-Radau quadrature to the block case, facilitating the derivation of easily computable error bounds. For problems stemming from the discretization of self-adjoint operators with a continuous spectrum, we obtain sharp estimates grounded in potential theory for Pad\'e approximations and justify averaging algorithms at no added computational cost. The obtained results are illustrated on large-scale examples of 2D diffusion and 3D Maxwell's equations and a graph from the SNAP repository. We also present promising experimental results on convergence acceleration via random enrichment of the initial block $B$.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Dynamical Low-rank Approach for Charged Particle Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministically solving charged particle transport problems at a sufficient spatial and angular resolution is often prohibitively expensive, especially due to their highly forward peaked scattering. We propose a model order reduction approach which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold in time, making computations feasible at much higher resolutions and reducing the overall run-time and memory footprint.
  For this, we use a hybrid dynamical low-rank approach based on a collided-uncollided split, i.e., the transport equation is split through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described using a ray tracer, facilitating the inclusion of boundary conditions and straggling, whereas collided particles are represented using a moment method combined with the dynamical low-rank approximation. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. We can reproduce the results of a full-rank reference code at a much lower rank and thus computational cost and memory usage. The solution further achieves comparable accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC as previous deterministic approaches.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a cetnral MUSCL-type scheme for conservation laws with discontinuous flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a Nessyahu-Tadmor-type second-order central scheme for a class of scalar conservation laws with discontinuous flux and present its convergence analysis. Since solutions to problems with discontinuous flux typically do not belong to the space of bounded variation (BV), we employ the theory of compensated compactness as the main tool for the convergence of approximate solutions. A central component of the analysis involves establishing the maximum principle and the $\mathrm{W}^{-1,2}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ compactness of the approximate solutions, the latter achieved through the derivation of several essential estimates. Finally, by introducing a mesh-dependent correction term in the slope limiter, we show that the numerical solutions generated by the the proposed second-order scheme converge to the entropy solution.</description>

      <title>AlgoFormer: An Efficient Transformer Framework with Algorithmic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Besides natural language processing, transformers exhibit extraordinary performance in solving broader applications, including scientific computing and computer vision. Previous works try to explain this from the expressive power and capability perspectives that standard transformers are capable of performing some algorithms. To empower transformers with algorithmic capabilities and motivated by the recently proposed looped transformer, we design a novel transformer framework, dubbed Algorithm Transformer (abbreviated as AlgoFormer). We provide an insight that efficient transformer architectures can be designed by leveraging prior knowledge of tasks and the underlying structure of potential algorithms. Compared with the standard transformer and vanilla looped transformer, the proposed AlgoFormer can perform efficiently in algorithm representation in some specific tasks. In particular, inspired by the structure of human-designed learning algorithms, our transformer framework consists of a pre-transformer that is responsible for task preprocessing, a looped transformer for iterative optimization algorithms, and a post-transformer for producing the desired results after post-processing. We provide theoretical evidence of the expressive power of the AlgoFormer in solving some challenging problems, mirroring human-designed algorithms. Furthermore, some theoretical and empirical results are presented to show that the designed transformer has the potential to perform algorithm representation and learning. Experimental results demonstrate the empirical superiority of the proposed transformer in that it outperforms the standard transformer and vanilla looped transformer in some specific tasks. An extensive experiment on real language tasks (e.g., neural machine translation of German and English, and text classification) further validates the expressiveness and effectiveness of AlgoFormer.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wave Localisation in Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of metamaterials composed of high-contrast subwavelength resonators and show the existence of localised modes in such a setting. A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</description>
