      <title>Uncovering Coordinated Cross-Platform Information Operations Threatening the Integrity of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Online Discussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Operations (IOs) pose a significant threat to the integrity of democratic processes, with the potential to influence election-related online discourse. In anticipation of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we present a study aimed at uncovering the digital traces of coordinated IOs on $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly Twitter). Using our machine learning framework for detecting online coordination, we analyze a dataset comprising election-related conversations on $\mathbb{X}$ from May 2024. This reveals a network of coordinated inauthentic actors, displaying notable similarities in their link-sharing behaviors. Our analysis shows concerted efforts by these accounts to disseminate misleading, redundant, and biased information across the Web through a coordinated cross-platform information operation: The links shared by this network frequently direct users to other social media platforms or suspicious websites featuring low-quality political content and, in turn, promoting the same $\mathbb{X}$ and YouTube accounts. Members of this network also shared deceptive images generated by AI, accompanied by language attacking political figures and symbolic imagery intended to convey power and dominance. While $\mathbb{X}$ has suspended a subset of these accounts, more than 75% of the coordinated network remains active. Our findings underscore the critical role of developing computational models to scale up the detection of threats on large social media platforms, and emphasize the broader implications of these techniques to detect IOs across the wider Web.</description>

      <title>The anonymization problem in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general version of the anonymization problem in social networks, in which the goal is to maximize the number of anonymous nodes by altering a given graph. We define three variants of this optimization problem, being full, partial and budgeted anonymization. In each, the objective is to maximize the number of k-anonymous nodes, i.e., nodes for which there are at least k-1 equivalent nodes, according to a particular anonymity measure of structural node equivalence. We propose six new heuristic algorithms for solving the anonymization problem which we implement into the reusable ANO-NET computational framework. As a baseline, we use an edge sampling method introduced in previous work. Experiments on both graph models and 17 real-world network datasets result in three empirical findings. First, we demonstrate that edge deletion is the most effective graph alteration operation. Second, we compare four commonly used anonymity measures from the literature and highlight how the choice of anonymity measure has a tremendous effect on both the achieved anonymity as well as the difficulty of solving the anonymization problem. Third, we find that the proposed algorithms that preferentially delete edges with a larger effect on nodes at a structurally unique position consistently outperform heuristics solely based on network structure. With similar runtimes, our algorithms retain on average 17 times more edges, ensuring higher data utility after full anonymization. In the budgeted variant, they achieve 4.4 times more anonymous nodes than the baseline. This work lays important foundations for future development of algorithms for anonymizing social networks.</description>

      <title>Geometric Relational Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relational representation learning transforms relational data into continuous and low-dimensional vector representations. However, vector-based representations fall short in capturing crucial properties of relational data that are complex and symbolic. We propose geometric relational embeddings, a paradigm of relational embeddings that respect the underlying symbolic structures. Specifically, this dissertation introduces various geometric relational embedding models capable of capturing: 1) complex structured patterns like hierarchies and cycles in networks and knowledge graphs; 2) logical structures in ontologies and logical constraints applicable for constraining machine learning model outputs; and 3) high-order structures between entities and relations. Our results obtained from benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of geometric relational embeddings in adeptly capturing these discrete, symbolic, and structured properties inherent in relational data.</description>

      <title>English offensive text detection using CNN based Bi-GRU model</title>

Abstract: Over the years, the number of users of social media has increased drastically. People frequently share their thoughts through social platforms, and this leads to an increase in hate content. In this virtual community, individuals share their views, express their feelings, and post photos, videos, blogs, and more. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter provide platforms to share vast amounts of content with a single click. However, these platforms do not impose restrictions on the uploaded content, which may include abusive language and explicit images unsuitable for social media. To resolve this issue, a new idea must be implemented to divide the inappropriate content. Numerous studies have been done to automate the process. In this paper, we propose a new Bi-GRU-CNN model to classify whether the text is offensive or not. The combination of the Bi-GRU and CNN models outperforms the existing model</description>

      <title>GraphGI:A GNN Explanation Method using Game Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention and have been extensively utilized across various domains. However, similar to other deep learning models, GNNs are often viewed as black-box models, making it challenging to interpret their prediction mechanisms. Current graph explanation techniques focus on identifying key nodes or edges, attributing the critical data features that drive model predictions. Nevertheless, these features do not independently influence the model's outcomes; rather, they interact with one another to collectively affect predictions. In this work, we propose a novel explanatory method GraphGI, which identifies the coalition with the highest interaction strength and presents it as an explanatory subgraph. Given a trained model and an input graph, our method explains predictions by gradually incorporating significant edges into the selected subgraph. We utilize game-theoretic interaction values to assess the interaction strength after edge additions, ensuring that the newly added edges confer maximum interaction strength to the explanatory subgraph. To enhance computational efficiency, we adopt effective approximation techniques for calculating Shapley values and game-theoretic interaction values. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior fidelity and sparsity, maintaining the interpretability of the results at a comprehensible level.</description>

      <title>NFTracer: Tracing NFT Impact Dynamics in Transaction-flow Substitutive Systems with Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impact dynamics are crucial for estimating the growth patterns of NFT projects by tracking the diffusion and decay of their relative appeal among stakeholders. Machine learning methods for impact dynamics analysis are incomprehensible and rigid in terms of their interpretability and transparency, whilst stakeholders require interactive tools for informed decision-making. Nevertheless, developing such a tool is challenging due to the substantial, heterogeneous NFT transaction data and the requirements for flexible, customized interactions. To this end, we integrate intuitive visualizations to unveil the impact dynamics of NFT projects. We first conduct a formative study and summarize analysis criteria, including substitution mechanisms, impact attributes, and design requirements from stakeholders. Next, we propose the Minimal Substitution Model to simulate substitutive systems of NFT projects that can be feasibly represented as node-link graphs. Particularly, we utilize attribute-aware techniques to embed the project status and stakeholder behaviors in the layout design. Accordingly, we develop a multi-view visual analytics system, namely NFTracer, allowing interactive analysis of impact dynamics in NFT transactions. We demonstrate the informativeness, effectiveness, and usability of NFTracer by performing two case studies with domain experts and one user study with stakeholders. The studies suggest that NFT projects featuring a higher degree of similarity are more likely to substitute each other. The impact of NFT projects within substitutive systems is contingent upon the degree of stakeholders' influx and projects' freshness.</description>

      <title>Collective memory, consensus, and learning explained by social cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans cluster in social groups where they discuss their shared past, problems, and potential solutions; they learn collectively when they repeat activities; they establish social norms; they synchronize when they sing or dance together; and they bond through social cohesion. A group is more cohesive if its members are closer together in their network and are bonded by multiple connections. Network proximity and redundancy are indicated by the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the group network, called the algebraic connectivity. This eigenvalue is key to explaining and predicting the outcomes of said activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph learning has become indispensable for interpreting and harnessing relational data in diverse fields, ranging from recommendation systems to social network analysis. In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Prompt Learning: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstrated remarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domains such as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval. This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review, we provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to impact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) community.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing data in Irish sagas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust to a large random removal of edges.</description>
