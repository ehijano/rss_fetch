      <title>Two Tiling is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the following problem is undecidable: given two polygonal prototiles, determine whether the plane can be tiled with rotated and translated copies of them. This improves a result of Demaine and Langerman [SoCG 2025], who showed undecidability for three tiles.
  Along the way, we show that tiling with one prototile is undecidable if there can be edge-to-edge matching rules. This is the first result to show undecidability for monotiling with only local matching constraints.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Persistence of Harmonic Chains: Barcode and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistence barcode is a topological descriptor of data that plays a fundamental role in topological data analysis. Given a filtration of data, the persistence barcode tracks the evolution of its homology groups. In this paper, we introduce a new type of barcode, called the harmonic chain barcode, which tracks the evolution of harmonic chains. In addition, we show that the harmonic chain barcode is stable. Given a filtration of a simplicial complex of size $m$, we present an algorithm to compute its harmonic chain barcode in $O(m^3)$ time. Consequently, the harmonic chain barcode can enrich the family of topological descriptors in applications where a persistence barcode is applicable, such as feature vectorization and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Features in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of large language models is critical given their widespread applications. To achieve this, we aim to connect a formal mathematical framework - zigzag persistence from topological data analysis - with practical and easily applicable algorithms. Zigzag persistence is particularly effective for characterizing data as it dynamically transforms across model layers. Within this framework, we introduce topological descriptors that measure how topological features, $p$-dimensional holes, persist and evolve throughout the layers. Unlike methods that assess each layer individually and then aggregate the results, our approach directly tracks the full evolutionary path of these features. This offers a statistical perspective on how prompts are rearranged and their relative positions changed in the representation space, providing insights into the system's operation as an integrated whole. To demonstrate the expressivity and applicability of our framework, we highlight how sensitive these descriptors are to different models and a variety of datasets. As a showcase application to a downstream task, we use zigzag persistence to establish a criterion for layer pruning, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preserving the system-level perspective.</description>
