      <title>Harmonious Color Pairings: Insights from Human Preference and Natural Hue Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues, enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent, challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.</description>

      <title>Kokatsuji: A Visualization Approach for Typographic Forensics of Early Japanese Movable Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a visualization system designed to support typographic forensics in the study of Kokatsuji, the short-lived tradition of Japanese movable wooden type printing. Building on recent advances in machine learning for block identification, our system provides expert users with an interactive tool for exploring, validating hypothesis, and integrating expert knowledge into model-generated results about the production process of early printed books. The system is structured around an ontology of four conceptual objects (spreads, segments, blocks, and characters) each corresponding to a dedicated view in the system. These coordinated views enable scholars to navigate between material evidence and computational abstractions, supporting close, near-by, and distant reading practices. Preliminary results from expert use of the system demonstrate its ability to reveal errors in segmentation, inconsistencies in clustering, and previously inaccessible patterns of block reuse.</description>

      <title>Prompting with Sign Parameters for Low-resource Sign Language Instruction Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures, promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Design Optimization through Natural Language Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.</description>

      <title>Designing Doable and Locally-adapted Action Cards for an Interactive Tabletop Game To Support Bottom-Up Flood Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serious games can support communities in becoming more flood resilient. However, the process of identifying and integrating locally relevant and doable actions into gameplay is complex and underresearched. We approached the challenge by collaborating with a community-led education center and applying an iterative and participatory design process of identifying and defining actions that may increase local applicability and relevance. The process comprised a field observation, two expert focus groups (n=4), and an online survey (n=13). Our findings identified 27 actions related to increasing or maintaining individuals' and communities' flood resilience, which we turned into 20 playing cards. These action cards are a part of a larger interactive tabletop game, which we are currently developing. Our work discusses the potential of card games to educate non-experts to increase flood resilience, and contributes to our process of identifying local needs and conditions, and turning them into engaging game artifacts for bottom-up empowerment.</description>

      <title>SafeSpace: An Integrated Web Application for Digital Safety and Emotional Well-being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital era, individuals are increasingly exposed to online harms such as toxicity, manipulation, and grooming, which often pose emotional and safety risks. Existing systems for detecting abusive content or issuing safety alerts operate in isolation and rarely combine digital safety with emotional well-being. In this paper, we present SafeSpace, a unified web application that integrates three modules: (1) toxicity detection in chats and screenshots using NLP models and Google's Perspective API, (2) a configurable safety ping system that issues emergency alerts with the user's live location (longitude and latitude) via SMTP-based emails when check-ins are missed or SOS alerts are manually triggered, and (3) a reflective questionnaire that evaluates relationship health and emotional resilience. The system employs Firebase for alert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy, and scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92% alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring. SafeSpace, implemented as a web application, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with future deployment envisioned as a mobile application for broader accessibility.</description>

      <title>Physically Plausible Data Augmentations for Wearable IMU-based Human Activity Recognition Using Physics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation. PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First, we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in HAR.</description>

      <title>LingVarBench: Benchmarking LLM for Automated Named Entity Recognition in Structured Synthetic Spoken Transcriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.</description>

      <title>Embarrassed to observe: The effects of directive language in brand conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore, directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context, the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.</description>

      <title>Towards Recommending Usability Improvements with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces (UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual, and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility, we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited expert resources.</description>

      <title>EEG Study of the Influence of Imagined Temperature Sensations on Neuronal Activity in the Sensorimotor Cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of sensory imagery is crucial for advancing cognitive neuroscience and developing novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigms. This study investigated the influence of imagined temperature sensations (ITS) on neural activity within the sensorimotor cortex. The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40{\deg}C Hot, 20{\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p&gt;.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p&lt;.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.</description>

      <title>The next question after Turing's question: Introducing the Grow-AI test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom), designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal, the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation. The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics, computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards maturity.</description>

      <title>HOSt3R: Keypoint-free Hand-Object 3D Reconstruction from RGB images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16465v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.</description>

      <title>Real-time 3D Light-field Viewing with Eye-tracking on Conventional Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating immersive 3D visual experiences typically requires expensive and specialized hardware such as VR headsets, autostereoscopic displays, or active shutter glasses. These constraints limit the accessibility and everyday use of 3D visualization technologies in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose a low-cost system that enables real-time 3D light-field viewing using only a standard 2D monitor, a conventional RGB webcam, and red-cyan anaglyph glasses. The system integrates real-time eye-tracking to dynamically adapt the displayed light-field image to the user's head position with a lightweight rendering pipeline that selects and composites stereoscopic views from pre-captured light-field data. The resulting anaglyph image is updated in real-time, creating a more immersive and responsive 3D experience. The system operates entirely on CPU and maintains a stable frame rate of 30 FPS, confirming its feasibility on typical consumer-grade hardware. All of these highlight the potential of our approach as an accessible platform for interactive 3D applications in education, digital media, and beyond.</description>

      <title>How Performance Pressure Influences AI-Assisted Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many domains now employ AI-based decision-making aids, and although the potential for AI systems to assist with decision making is much discussed, human-AI collaboration often underperforms due to factors such as (mis)trust in the AI system and beliefs about AI being incapable of completing subjective tasks. One potential tool for influencing human decision making is performance pressure, which hasn't been much studied in interaction with human-AI decision making. In this work, we examine how pressure and explainable AI (XAI) techniques interact with AI advice-taking behavior. Using an inherently low-stakes task (spam review classification), we demonstrate effective and simple methods to apply pressure and influence human AI advice-taking behavior by manipulating financial incentives and imposing time limits. Our results show complex interaction effects, with different combinations of pressure and XAI techniques either improving or worsening AI advice taking behavior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these interactions, strategies to effectively use pressure, and encourage future research to incorporate pressure analysis.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM Tutoring Systems for Non-Native English Speakers in Introductory CS Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer science has historically presented barriers for non-native English speaking (NNES) students, often due to language and terminology challenges. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is potential to leverage this technology to support NNES students more effectively. Recent implementations of LLMs as tutors in classrooms have shown promising results. In this study, we deployed an LLM tutor in an accelerated introductory computing course to evaluate its effectiveness specifically for NNES students. Key insights for LLM tutor use are as follows: NNES students signed up for the LLM tutor at a similar rate to native English speakers (NES); NNES students used the system at a lower rate than NES students -- to a small effect; NNES students asked significantly more questions in languages other than English compared to NES students, with many of the questions being multilingual by incorporating English programming keywords. Results for views of the LLM tutor are as follows: both NNES and NES students appreciated the LLM tutor for its accessibility, conversational style, and the guardrails put in place to guide users to answers rather than directly providing solutions; NNES students highlighted its approachability as they did not need to communicate in perfect English; NNES students rated help-seeking preferences of online resources higher than NES students; Many NNES students were unfamiliar with computing terminology in their native languages. These results suggest that LLM tutors can be a valuable resource for NNES students in computing, providing tailored support that enhances their learning experience and overcomes language barriers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through a series of workshops, we looked at ways to structure and scaffold group dialogue, and support the emergence of novel design patterns. We contrast these sessions--which we ran with other humans--with two "virtual workshops" which we simulated with ChatGPT. Limitations in both human and virtual settings are discussed, alongside lessons learned. We conclude by proposing a development trajectory that combines AI agents, pattern-based design, and institutional governance.</description>

      <title>The Teacher's Dilemma: Balancing Trade-Offs in Programming Education for Emergent Bilingual Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K-12 computing teachers must navigate complex trade-offs when selecting programming languages and instructional materials for classrooms with emergent bilingual students. While they aim to foster an inclusive learning environment by addressing language barriers that impact student engagement, they must also align with K-12 computer science curricular guidelines and prepare students for industry-standard programming tools. Because programming languages predominantly use English keywords and most instructional materials are written in English, these linguistic barriers introduce cognitive load and accessibility challenges. This paper examines teachers' decisions in balancing these competing priorities, highlighting the tensions between accessibility, curriculum alignment, and workforce preparation. The findings shed light on how our teacher participants negotiate these trade-offs and what factors influence their selection of programming tools to best support EB students while meeting broader educational and professional goals.</description>

      <title>FACET: Teacher-Centred LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems-Towards Personalized Educational Worksheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Cross-Domain EEG Analysis Application: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis, systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable, interpretable, and online actionable solutions.</description>

      <title>Spiders Based on Anxiety: How Reinforcement Learning Can Deliver Desired User Experience in Virtual Reality Personalized Arachnophobia Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need to generate a spider to provoke a desired anxiety response arises in the context of personalized virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), a treatment approach for arachnophobia. This treatment involves patients observing virtual spiders in order to become desensitized and decrease their phobia, which requires that the spiders elicit specific anxiety responses. However, VRET approaches tend to require therapists to hand-select the appropriate spider for each patient, which is a time-consuming process and takes significant technical knowledge and patient insight. While automated methods exist, they tend to employ rules-based approaches with minimal ability to adapt to specific users. To address these challenges, we present a framework for VRET utilizing procedural content generation (PCG) and reinforcement learning (RL), which automatically adapts a spider to elicit a desired anxiety response. We demonstrate the superior performance of this system compared to a more common rules-based VRET method.</description>

      <title>Validating LLM-as-a-Judge Systems under Rating Indeterminacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such judge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however, rating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM rater may deem multiple ratings "reasonable" or "correct". We call this condition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain rating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are instructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce a framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy. We draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system performance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in how humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy while responding to forced-choice rating instructions heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation. Through extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 8 commercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon forced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 30% worse than judge systems selected by our approach that uses multi-label "response set" ratings to account for rating indeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.</description>

      <title>MedArabiQ: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Arabic Medical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various applications in healthcare. However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.</description>

      <title>VIBE: Video-to-Text Information Bottleneck Evaluation for TL;DR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.</description>
