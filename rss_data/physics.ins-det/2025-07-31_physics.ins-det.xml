      <title>Development of a RPC system with detailed performance simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos, elusive and abundant, interact weakly with matter, making detection challenging. This thesis explores neutrino physics, focusing on mass hierarchy and oscillations, with emphasis on India's upcoming INO facility. The Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector, using Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) within magnetized iron plates, aims to resolve neutrino mass hierarchy and precisely measure $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$, potentially revealing new physics. The study advances RPC development through simulation techniques. A straight-line model calculates space charge effects during avalanche or streamer processes, improving electric field estimation speed and accuracy. Polarization effects in dielectric electrodes are analyzed, elucidating electric field dependence on electrode parameters. A new class, pAvalancheMC, integrated into Garfield++ software, combines straight-line and image charge models to simulate space charge effects. Using OpenMP for parallel computing, it achieves significant speed-ups in electron-ion pair generation and space charge field calculations. Practically, an eight-RPC stack was developed at VECC to measure cosmic muon scattering angles in high-density materials. A testbench evaluates efficiency, crosstalk, and hit uniformity. A reconstruction algorithm, validated with data from the IICHEP stack in Madurai, supports the VECC stack's potential. This work enhances neutrino physics understanding and advances RPC-based detection technologies.</description>

      <title>Manufacturing Tolerances of Non-Planar Coils for an Optimized Tabletop Stellarator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarator coils are known for their complexity and departure from planarity, along with tight manufacturing tolerances in order to achieve the target magnetic field accuracy. These requirements can lead to increased costs and delays in assembly; failure to meet them can compromise the stellarator's performance. Small-scale experiments offer opportunities to develop and benchmark stellarator coil design and evaluation methods more quickly and at lower budget. In this work, we analyze precise 3D scans of the manufacturing deviations of two 3D-printed coil frames (steel, Ti alloy) and one CNC-machined coil frame (Al alloy), as part of assessing these approaches to fabricating high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils for a tabletop stellarator. The deviations are measured along the coil length, then modeled using Gaussian processes to extract characteristic length scales. Finally a statistical study of field accuracy is performed using relevant experimental parameters. We conclude that the manufacturing perturbations along the winding path from CNC-machining are almost an order of magnitude lower than those from Additive Manufacturing. Together with high overall fabrication accuracy, this allows for higher magnetic field precision and an improved assembly process.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits, at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>RENE experiment for the sterile neutrino search using reactor neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper summarizes the details of the Reactor Experiment for Neutrinos and Exotics (RENE) experiment. It covers the detector construction, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation study, and physics expectations. The primary goal of the RENE project is to investigate the sterile neutrino oscillation at $\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}\sim 2\,{\rm{eV}^{2}}$. which overlap with the allowed region predicted by the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA). On the other hand, the STEREO and PROSPECT experiments have excluded certain regions of the parameter space with 95 \% confidence level (C.L.), while the joint study conducted by RENO and NEOS suggests possible indications of sterile neutrinos at $\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}\sim2.4\,{\rm{eV}^{2}}$ and $\sim{1.7}{\,\rm{eV}^{2}}$ with sin$^{2}\theta_{41} &lt; 0.01$. Accordingly, a more meticulous investigation of these remaining regions continues to be a scientifically valuable endeavor. This paper reports the technical details of the detector and physics objectives.</description>

      <title>Use of solid fused silica etalon with broadband metallic coatings for calibration of high-resolution optical spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g., ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-P\'erot etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm. A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-P\'erot etalons, and although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.</description>

      <title>Characterization of mini-CryoCube detectors from the Ricochet experiment commissioning at the Institut Laue-Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ricochet experiment aims to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process from antineutrinos emitted by a research nuclear reactor operated by the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). This article presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to 7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals. This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil background of &lt; 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded detectors.</description>

      <title>Imaging simulation of a dual-panel PET geometry with ultrafast TOF detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), time-of-flight (TOF) information localizes source positions along lines of response. Cherenkov-radiator-integrated microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes have achieved 30 ps TOF resolution, demonstrating cross-sectional imaging without reconstruction. Such ultrafast TOF detectors would free PET from conventional ring geometries. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating imaging characteristics of a dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors using Geant4 simulation. Two detector panels ($137 \times 137~\text{mm}^2$), which consisted of 5.0 mm-thick bismuth germanate pixelized crystals with a 5.75 mm pitch, were placed face-to-face at a 300 mm distance. Imaging characteristics with various TOF resolutions from 30 to 90 ps were evaluated. Because degraded efficiency may cancel TOF gain in image quality, detection efficiency was also parameterized by reducing coincidence counts. Data acquisitions for a numerical multi-rod and uniform phantom (21 MBq) and a modified NEMA NU2 image quality phantom were simulated for 600 s. Results of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction were compared with those of a backprojection (i.e., no reconstruction). The dual-panel PET required a 40 ps TOF resolution to have a similar spatial resolution to that of a non-TOF ring PET (300 mm in diameter) for the same detection efficiency. TOF showed benefit in the reconstruction of image quality phantom with 40% efficiency, and the image noise with 20% efficiency at 30 ps TOF was similar to the complete efficiency at 40 ps TOF. MLEM provided better imaging performance than backprojection, even at 30 ps TOF. The feasibility of the proposed dual-panel PET was shown.</description>

      <title>Towards a Robust Model-Independent Test of the DAMA/LIBRA Dark Matter Signal: ANAIS-112 Results with Six Years of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter, which constitutes 27% of the Universe's matter-energy content, remains one of the most challenging open questions in physics. Over the past two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has reported an annual modulation in the detection rate of $\approx$250 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors operated at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which the collaboration interprets as evidence of the galactic dark matter detection. However, this claim has not been independently confirmed and is refuted under certain dark matter particle and halo model scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to perform an experiment with the same target material. The ANAIS experiment uses 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory and it has been collecting data since August 2017 to model-independently test the DAMA/LIBRA result. This article presents the results of the annual modulation analysis corresponding to six years of ANAIS-112 data. Our results, the most sensitive to date with the same target material, NaI(Tl), are incompatible with the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal at a 4$\sigma$ confidence level. Such a discrepancy strongly challenges the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter interpretation and highlights the need to address systematic uncertainties affecting the comparison, particularly those related to the response of detectors to nuclear recoils, which may require further characterization of the DAMA crystals.</description>

      <title>femto-PIXAR: a neural network method for reconstruction of femtosecond X-ray free electron laser pulse energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Free Electron Lasers (X\nobreakdash-FELs) operate in a wide range of lasing configurations for a broad variety of scientific applications at ultrafast time-scales such as structural biology, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g. those needed for coherent, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.</description>
