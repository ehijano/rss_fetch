      <title>Cardinals of the $P_\kappa(\lambda)$-Filter Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate forms of filter extension properties in the two-cardinal setting involving filters on $P_\kappa(\lambda)$. We generalize the filter games introduced by Holy and Schlicht in \cite{HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals} to filters on $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ and show that the existence of a winning strategy for Player II in a game of a certain length can be used to characterize several large cardinal notions such as: $\lambda$-super/strongly compact cardinals, $\lambda$-completely ineffable cardinals, nearly $\lambda$-super/strongly compact cardinals, and various notions of generic super and strong compactness. We generalize a result of Nielson from \cite{NielsenWelch:games_and_Ramsey-like_cardinals} connecting the existence of a winning strategy for Player II in a game of finite length and two-cardinal indescribability. We generalize the result of \cite{ForMagZem} to construct a fine $\kappa$-complete precipitous ideal on $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ from a winning strategy for Player II in a game of length $\omega$. Finally, we improve Theorems 1.2 and 1.4 from \cite{ForMagZem} and partially answer questions Q.1 and Q.2 from \cite{ForMagZem}.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic randomness and the weak merging of computable probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize Martin-L\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness in terms of the merging of opinions, along the lines of the Blackwell-Dubins Theorem. After setting up a general framework for defining notions of merging randomness, we focus on finite horizon events, that is, on weak merging in the sense of Kalai-Lehrer. In contrast to Blackwell-Dubins and Kalai-Lehrer, we consider not only the total variational distance but also the Hellinger distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our main result is a characterization of Martin-L\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness in terms of weak merging and the summable Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main proof idea is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between $\mu$ and $\nu$, at a given stage of the learning process, is exactly the incremental growth, at that stage, of the predictable process of the Doob decomposition of the $\nu$-submartingale $L(\sigma)=-\ln \frac{\mu(\sigma)}{\nu(\sigma)}$. These characterizations of algorithmic randomness notions in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence can be viewed as global analogues of Vovk's theorem on what transpires locally with individual Martin-L\"of $\mu$- and $\nu$-random points and the Hellinger distance between $\mu,\nu$.</description>

      <title>The Axiom-Based Atlas: A Structural Mapping of Theorems via Foundational Proof Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Axiom-Based Atlas is a novel framework that structurally represents mathematical theorems as proof vectors over foundational axiom systems. By mapping the logical dependencies of theorems onto vectors indexed by axioms - such as those from Hilbert geometry, Peano arithmetic, or ZFC - we offer a new way to visualize, compare, and analyze mathematical knowledge. This vector-based formalism not only captures the logical foundation of theorems but also enables quantitative similarity metrics - such as cosine distance - between mathematical results, offering a new analytic layer for structural comparison. Using heatmaps, vector clustering, and AI-assisted modeling, this atlas enables the grouping of theorems by logical structure, not just by mathematical domain. We also introduce a prototype assistant (Atlas-GPT) that interprets natural language theorems and suggests likely proof vectors, supporting future applications in automated reasoning, mathematical education, and formal verification.
  This direction is partially inspired by Terence Tao's recent reflections on the convergence of symbolic and structural mathematics. The Axiom-Based Atlas aims to provide a scalable, interpretable model of mathematical reasoning that is both human-readable and AI-compatible, contributing to the future landscape of formal mathematical systems.</description>

      <title>Robust No-Arbitrage under Projective Determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing from set theory, this article contributes to a deeper understanding of the no-arbitrage principle in multiple-priors settings and its application in mathematical finance.
  In the quasi-sure discrete-time frictionless market framework of Bouchard and Nutz, the equivalence between the quasi-sure no-arbitrage condition and the existence of a probability measure for which the local one-prior no-arbitrage condition holds and the affine hull of the support is equal to the quasi-sure support, all of this in a quasi-sure sense, was established by Blanchard and Carassus. We aim to extend this result to the projective setup introduced by Carassus and Ferhoune.
  This setup allows for standardised measurability assumptions, in contrast to the framework of Bouchard and Nutz, where prices are assumed to be Borel measurable, strategies and stochastic kernels universally measurable, and the graphs of one-step priors analytic sets.
  To achieve this, we assume the classical axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, including the axiom of choice (ZFC), supplemented by the Projective Determinacy (PD) axiom. In ZFC+PD the existence of such probability measures was assumed by Carassus and Ferhoune to prove the existence of solutions in a quasi-sure nonconcave utility maximisation problem. The equivalence with the quasi-sure no-arbitrage was only conjectured.</description>

      <title>Logical perspectives on learning statistical objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between learnability of a ``base class'' of functions on a set X and learnability of a class of statistical functions derived from the base class. For example, we refine results showing that learnability of a family of functions implies learnability of the family of functions mapping a function in the class to its expectation under a distribution. We will look at both Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, where example inputs and outputs are chosen at random, and online learning, where the examples are chosen adversarially. We establish improved bounds on the sample complexity of learning for statistical classes, stated in terms of combinatorial dimensions of the base class. We do this by adapting techniques introduced in model theory for ``randomizing a structure''. We give particular attention to classes derived from logical formulas, and relate learnability of the statistical classes to properties of the formula. Finally, we provide bounds on the complexity of learning the statistical classes built on top of a logic-based hypothesis class.</description>

      <title>Beautiful pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an abstract framework to study certain classes of stably embedded pairs of models of a complete $\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$, called \textit{beautiful pairs}, which comprises Poizat's belles paires of stable structures and van den Dries-Lewenberg's tame pairs of o-minimal structures. Using an amalgamation construction, we relate several properties of beautiful pairs with properties analogous to properties in Fra\"{i}ss\'e classes.
  After characterizing beautiful pairs of various theories of ordered abelian groups and valued fields, including the theories of algebraically, $p$-adically and real closed valued fields, we show an Ax-Kochen-Ershov type result for beautiful pairs of henselian valued fields. As an application, we derive strict pro-definability of particular classes of definable types. When $T$ is one of the theories of valued fields mentioned above, the corresponding classes of types are related to classical geometric spaces and our main result specializes to their strict pro-definability. Most notably, we exhibit the strict pro-definability of a natural space of types associated to Huber's analytification. In this way, we also recover a result of Hrushovski-Loeser on the strict pro-definability of stably dominated types in algebraically closed valued fields, which corresponds to Berkovich's analytification.</description>

      <title>The Countable Reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a topos in which the Dedekind reals are countable.
  The topos arises from a new kind of realizability, which we call parameterized realizability, based on partial combinatory algebras whose application depends on a parameter. Realizers operate uniformly with respect to a given parameter set.
  Our construction uses a sequence of reals in $[0,1]$, discovered by Joseph Miller, that is non-diagonalizable in the sense that any real which is oracle-computable uniformly from representations of the sequence must already appear in it. When used as the parameter set, this yields a topos in which the non-diagonalizable sequence becomes an epimorphism onto the Dedekind reals, rendering them internally countable.
  The resulting topos is intuitionistic: it refutes both the law of excluded middle and countable choice. Nevertheless, much of analysis survives internally. The Cauchy reals are uncountable. The Hilbert cube is countable, so Brouwer's fixed-point theorem follows from Lawvere's. The intermediate value theorem and the analytic form of the lesser limited principle of omniscience hold, while the limited principle of omniscience fails. Although no real-valued map has a jump, it remains open whether all such maps are continuous.
  Finally, the closed interval $[0,1]$, being countable, can be covered by a sequence of open intervals of total length less than any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, with no finite subcover. Yet, we show that any cover using intervals with rational endpoints must admit a finite subcover.</description>

      <title>The behavior of higher proof theory I: Case $\Sigma^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current ordinal analysis provides the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory, which calibrates the robustness of the $\Pi^1_1$-consequences of the theory. We can ask whether there is an ordinal characteristic capturing more complex consequences, and it turns out that we can define the $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal capturing the robustness of the $\Sigma^1_2$-consequences of a theory. In this paper, we study the behavior of $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal, and it turns out that $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal also follows an analogue of Walsh's characterization of proof-theoretic ordinal.</description>

Abstract: Martin's remarkable proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy from an iterable rank-into-rank embedding highlighted the connection between large cardinals and determinacy. In this paper, we isolate a large cardinal object called a measurable dilator from Martin's proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy, which captures the structural essence of Martin's proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy.</description>

      <title>A note on the definition of derived functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to consider in detail the construction of derived functors. The classical construction, such as in Cartan-Eilenberg or Grothendieck, is clarified, and it is shown, at the same time, that everything can be formalized in ZFC, unlike the approach using derived categories. Our work is done in a more general context in which the codomain of our functors is any Grothendieck category, not necessarily abelian groups.</description>
