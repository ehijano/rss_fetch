      <title>Spectral evolution of RX J0440.9+4431 during the 2022-2023 giant outburst observed with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022-2023, the X-ray pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 underwent a Type II giant outburst, reaching a peak luminosity L_x ~ 4*10^{37} erg/s. In this work, we utilize Insight-HXMT data to analyze the spectral evolution of RX J0440.9+4431 during the giant outburst. By analysing the variation of the X-ray spectrum during the outburst using standard phenomenological models, we find that as the luminosity approaches the critical luminosity, the spectrum became flatter, with the photon enhancement predominantly concentrated around ~ 2 keV and 20-40 keV. The same behavior has also been noted in Type II outbursts from other sources. While the phenomenological models provide good fits to the spectrum, this approach is sometimes difficult to translate into direct insight into the details of the fundamental accretion physics. Hence we have also analyzed spectra obtained during high and low phases of the outburst using a new, recently-developed physics-based theoretical model, which allows us to study the variations of physical parameters such as temperature, density, and magnetic field strength during the outburst. Application of the theoretical model reveals that the observed spectrum is dominated by Comptonized bremsstrahlung emission emitted from the column walls in both the high and low states. We show that the spectral flattening observed at high luminosities results from a decrease in the electron temperature, combined with a compactification of the emission zone, which reduces the efficiency of bulk Comptonization. We also demonstrate that when the source is at maximum luminosity, the spectrum tends to harden around the peak of the pulse profile, and we discuss possible theoretical explanations for this behavior. We argue that the totality of the behavior in this source can be explained if the accretion column is in a quasi-critical state when at the maximum luminosity observed during the outburst.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic instability in rapidly accreting supermassive stars in the presence of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) via the general-relativistic (GR) instability would provide a natural explanation to the existence of the most extreme quasars. The presence of dark matter in SMSs is thought to potentially impact their properties, in particular their mass at collapse. Dark matter might be made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that can be captured by the gravitational potential well of SMSs due to interaction with the baryonic gas. The annihilation of WIMPs can provide fuel to support the star before H-burning ignition, favouring low densities of baryonic gas, long stellar lifetimes and high final masses. Here, we estimate the impact of dark matter on the GR dynamical stability of rapidly accreting SMSs. We add a dark matter term to the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations and apply it to hylotropic structures in order to determine the onset point of the GR instability. We find that, in principle, the dark matter gravitational field can remove completely the GR instability. However, for SMSs fuelled by H-burning, the dark matter densities required to stabilise the star against GR are orders of magnitude above the values that are expected for the dark matter background. On the other hand, for SMSs fuelled by WIMP annihilation, we find that the low densities of baryonic gas inhibit the destabilising GR corrections, which shifts the stability limit by typically an order of magnitude towards higher masses. As long as central temperatures $\lesssim10^7$ K are maintained by WIMP annihilation, the GR instability is reached only for stellar masses $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$. Dark matter can impact the GR dynamical stability of SMSs only in the case of energetically significant WIMP annihilation. The detection of a SMS with mass $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$ in an atomically cooled halo can be interpreted as an evidence of WIMP annihilation in the star's core.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the X-ray variability in the Lyman continuum emitter Haro 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman break analogs in the local Universe serve as counterparts to Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at high redshifts, which are widely regarded as major contributors to cosmic reionization in the early stages of the Universe. We studied XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the nearby LBG analog Haro 11, which contains two X-ray-bright sources, X1 and X2. Both sources exhibit Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage, particularly X2. We analyzed the X-ray variability using principal component analysis (PCA) and performed spectral modeling of the X1 and X2 observations made with the Chandra ACIS-S instrument. The PCA component, which contributes to the X-ray variability, is apparently associated with variable emission features, likely from ionized superwinds. Our spectral analysis of the Chandra data indicates that the fainter X-ray source, X2 (X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X} \sim 4 \times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$), the one with higher LyC leakage, has a much lower absorbing column ($N_{\rm H} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) than the heavily absorbed luminous source X1 ($L_{\rm X} \sim 9 \times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$ and $N_{\rm H} \sim 11.5 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$). We conclude that X2 is likely less covered by absorbing material, which may be a result of powerful superwinds clearing galactic channels and facilitating the escape of LyC radiation. Much deeper X-ray observations are required to validate the presence of potential superwinds and determine their implications for the LyC escape.</description>

      <title>A magnetized strongly turbulent corona as the source of neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cores of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are potential accelerators of 10-100 TeV cosmic rays, in turn producing high-energy neutrinos. This picture was confirmed by the compelling evidence of a TeV neutrino signal from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068, leaving open the question of which is the site and mechanism of cosmic ray acceleration. One candidate is the magnetized turbulence surrounding the central supermassive black hole. Recent particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence indicate that stochastic cosmic ray acceleration is non-resonant, in contrast to the assumptions of previous studies. We show that this has important consequences on a self-consistent theory of neutrino production in the corona, leading to a more rapid cosmic ray acceleration than previously considered. The turbulent magnetic field fluctuations needed to explain the neutrino signal are consistent with a magnetically powered corona. We find that strong turbulence, with turbulent magnetic energy density higher than $1\%$ of the rest mass energy density, naturally explains the normalization of the IceCube neutrino flux, in addition to the neutrino spectral shape. Only a fraction of the protons in the corona, which can be directly inferred from the neutrino signal, are accelerated to high energies. Thus, in this framework, the neutrino signal from NGC 1068 provides a testbed for particle acceleration in magnetized turbulence.</description>

      <title>Intrapulse spectral evolution in photospheric gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons that decouple from a relativistic jet do so over a range of radii, which leads to a spreading in arrival times at the observer. Therefore, changes to the comoving photon distribution across the decoupling zone are encoded in the emitted signal. In this paper, we study such spectral evolution occurring across a pulse. We track the radiation from the deep subphotospheric regions all the way to the observed time-resolved signal, accounting for emission at various angles and radii. We assume a simple power-law photon spectrum injection over a range of optical depths and let the photons interact with the local plasma. At high optical depths, we find that the radiation exists in one of three characteristic regimes, two of which exhibit a high-energy power law. Depending on the nature of the injection, this power law can persist to low optical depths and manifest itself during the rise time of the pulse with a spectral index $\beta \approx \alpha - 1$, where $\alpha$ is the low-energy spectral index. The results are given in the context of a gamma-ray burst jet but are general to optically thick, relativistic outflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray binaries have challenged our assumptions of extreme accretion rates in X-ray binaries, and impact other subfields of astronomy, such as cosmology, gravitational wave sources and supernov{\ae}. Our understanding of ULXs has changed tremendously over the last 35 years, and we now know that ULXs can be powered by accreting neutron stars as well as black holes, and can be found in a wide range of stellar environments. In this chapter, we introduce the observational techniques used to discover and characterize ULXs, and discuss our current understanding of their unique accretion physics and formation channels.</description>

      <title>TeV afterglow from GRB 221009A: photohadronic origin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 221009A, a long-duration GRB, was observed simultaneously by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) and the Kilometer Squared Array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) during the prompt emission and the afterglow periods. Characteristic multi-TeV photons up to 13 TeV were observed in the afterglow phase. The observed very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray spectra by WCDA and KM2A during different time intervals and in different energy ranges can be explained very well in the context of the photohadronic model with the inclusion of extragalactic background light models. In the photohadronic scenario, interaction of high-energy protons with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) photons in the forward shock region of the jet is assumed to be the source of these VHE photons. The observed VHE spectra from the afterglow of GRB 221009A are similar to the VHE gamma-ray spectra observed from the temporary extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac (EHBL), 1ES 2344+514 {\it only} during the 11th and the 12th of August, 2016. Such spectra are new and have been observed for the first time in a GRB.</description>

      <title>An Image-Based Search for Pulsar Candidates in the MeerKAT Bulge Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the results of an image-based search for pulsar candidates toward the Galactic bulge. We used mosaic images from the MeerKAT radio telescope, that were taken as part of a 173 deg**2 survey of the bulge and Galactic center of our Galaxy at L band (856-1712 MHz) in all four Stokes I, Q, U and V. The image root-mean-square noise levels of 12-17 uJy/ba represent a significant increase in sensitivity over past image-based pulsar searches. Our primary search criterion was circular polarization, but we used other criteria including linear polarization, in-band spectral index, compactness, variability and multi-wavelength counterparts to select pulsar candidates. We first demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by searching for polarized emission from known pulsars, and comparing our results with measurements from the literature. Our search resulted in a sample of 75 polarized pulsar candidates. Bright stars or young stellar objects were associated with 28 of these sources, including a small sample of highly polarized dwarf stars with pulsar-like steep spectra. Comparing the properties of this sample with the known pulsars, we identified 30 compelling candidates for pulsation follow-up, including two sources with both strong circular and linear polarization. The remaining 17 sources are either pulsars or stars, but we cannot rule out an extragalactic origin or image artifacts among the brighter, flat spectrum objects.</description>

      <title>Tayler-Spruit dynamo in stably stratified rotating fluids: Application to proto-magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of highly magnetized young neutron stars, called magnetars, is still a strongly debated question. A promising scenario invokes the amplification of the magnetic field by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo in a proto-neutron star (PNS) spun up by fallback. Barr\`ere et al. 2023 supports this scenario by demonstrating that this dynamo can generate magnetar-like magnetic fields in stably stratified Boussinesq models of a PNS interior. To further investigate the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, we perform 3D-MHD numerical simulations with the MagIC code varying the ratio between the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and the rotation rate. We first demonstrate that a self-sustained dynamo process can be maintained for a Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency about 4 times higher than the angular rotation frequency. The generated magnetic fields and angular momentum transport follow the analytical scaling laws of Fuller et al. 2019, which confirms our previous results. We also report for the first time the existence of an intermittent Tayler-Spruit dynamo. For a typical PNS Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency of $10^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, the axisymmetric toroidal and dipolar magnetic fields range between $1.2\times 10^{15}-2\times 10^{16}\,{\rm G}$ and $1.4\times 10^{13}-3\times 10^{15}\,{\rm G}$, for rotation periods of $1-10\,{\rm ms}$. Thus, our results provide numerical evidence that our scenario can explain the formation of magnetars. As the Tayler-Spruit dynamo is often invoked for the angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones, our results are also of particular importance in this field and we provide a calibration of the Fuller et al.'s prescription based on our simulations, with a dimensionless normalisation factor of the order of $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Prompt Emission From Long Gamma Ray Burst Simulations -- III. X-ray Spectropolarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) have the potential to shed light on the astrophysics of jets, compact objects, and cosmology, a major set back in their use as probes of these phenomena stems from our incomplete knowledge surrounding their prompt emission. There are numerous models that can account for various observations of GRBs in the gamma-ray and X-ray energy ranges due to the flexibility in the number of parameters that can be tuned to increase agreement with data. Furthermore, these models lack predictive power that can test future spectropolarimetric observations of GRBs across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we use the MCRaT radiative transfer code to calculate the X-ray spectropolarimetric signatures expected from the photospheric model for two unique hydrodynamic simulations of long GRBs. We make time-resolved and time-integrated comparisons between the X-ray and gamma-ray mock observations, shedding light on the information that can be obtained from X-ray prompt emission signatures. Our results show that the $T_{90}$ derived from the X-ray lightcurve is the best diagnostic for the time that the central engine is active. We also find that our simulations reproduce the observed characteristics of the Einstein Probe detected GRB240315C. Based on our simulations, we are also able to make predictions for future X-ray spectropolarimetric measurements. Our results show the importance of conducting global radiative transfer calculations of GRB jets to better contextualize the prompt emission observations and constrain the mechanisms that produce the prompt emission.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in the magnetic reconnection in the flares on the accretion disk of the SGR~A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sgr~A* often shows bright, episodic flares observationally, the mechanism of the flares intermittent brightening is not very clear. Many people believe the flares may formed by the non-thermal particles, which can be a consequence of the magnetic reconnection and shock waves. In this work, we use the larger magnetic loop in the presence of pseudo-Newtonian potential which mimics general relativistic effects. The simulation results show that the reconnection of magnetic field lines passes through a current sheet, which bifurcates into two pairs of slow shocks. We also find the shock waves heat the plasma, especially when the plasma density is low. The shock wave heating effect by the magnetic reconnection is confirmed by the simulation results, and thus the process of instantaneous brightening of the flares on the accretion disk can be explained.</description>

      <title>Radiation MHD Simulations of Soft X-ray Emitting Regions in Changing Look AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01876v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft X-rays are emitted from a warm ($T=10^6\sim10^7\ \rm{K}$) region that is optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region). Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations assuming that the mass accretion rate increases and becomes around $10$\% of the Eddington accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity $0.01L_{{\rm Edd}}-0.08L_{{\rm Edd}}$ is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the anti-parallel azimuthal magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.</description>

      <title>The three-dimensional structure of black hole accretion flows within the plunging region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse, using new analytical models and numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, the three-dimensional properties of accretion flows inside the plunging region of black hole spacetimes (i.e., at radii smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit). These simulations are of thick discs, with aspect ratios of order unity $h/r \sim 1$, and with a magnetic field geometry given by the standard low-magnetization "SANE" configuration. This work represents the first step in a wider analysis of this highly relativistic region. We show that analytical expressions derived in the "thin disc" limit describe the numerical results remarkably well, despite the large aspect ratio of the flow. We further demonstrate that accretion within this region is typically mediated via spiral arms, and that the geometric properties of these spiral structures can be understood with a simple analytical model. These results highlight how accretion within the plunging region is fundamentally two dimensional in character, which may have a number of observational implications. We derive a modified theoretical description of the pressure within the plunging region which accounts for turbulent heating and may be of use to black hole image modelling.</description>

Abstract: Localisation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to arcsecond and sub-arcsecond precision maximizes their potential as cosmological probes. To that end, FRB detection instruments are deploying triggered complex-voltage capture systems to localize FRBs, identify their host galaxy and measure a redshift. Here, we report the discovery and localisation of two FRBs (20220717A and 20220905A) that were captured by the transient buffer system deployed by the MeerTRAP instrument at the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa. We were able to localize the FRBs to a precision of $\sim$1 arc-second that allowed us to unambiguously identify the host galaxy for FRB 20220717A (posterior probability$\sim$0.97). FRB 20220905A lies in a crowded region of the sky with a tentative identification of a host galaxy but the faintness and the difficulty in obtaining an optical spectrum preclude a conclusive association. The bursts show low linear polarization fractions (10--17$\%$) that conform to the large diversity in the polarization fraction observed in apparently non-repeating FRBs akin to single pulses from neutron stars. We also show that the host galaxy of FRB 20220717A contributes roughly 15$\%$ of the total dispersion measure (DM), indicating that it is located in a plasma-rich part of the host galaxy which can explain the large rotation measure. The scattering in FRB 20220717A can be mostly attributed to the host galaxy and the intervening medium and is consistent with what is seen in the wider FRB population.</description>

Abstract: Context: There are currently three pulsars firmly detected by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), two of them reaching TeV energies, challenging models of very-high-energy (VHE) emission in pulsars. More precise observations are needed to better characterize pulsar emission at these energies. The LST-1 is the prototype of the Large-Sized Telescope, that will be part of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). Its improved performance over previous IACTs makes it well suited for studying pulsars. Aims: To study the Crab pulsar emission with the LST-1, improving and complementing the results from other telescopes. These observations can also be used to characterize the potential of the LST-1 to study other pulsars and detect new ones. Methods: We analyzed a total of $\sim$103 hours of gamma-ray observations of the Crab pulsar conducted with the LST-1 in the period from September 2020 to January 2023. The observations were carried out at zenith angles less than 50 degrees. A new analysis of the Fermi-LAT data was also performed, including $\sim$14 years of observations. Results: The Crab pulsar phaseogram, long-term light-curve, and phase-resolved spectra are reconstructed with the LST-1 from 20 GeV to 450 GeV for P1 and up to 700 GeV for P2. The pulsed emission is detected with a significance of 15.2$\sigma$. The two characteristic emission peaks of the Crab pulsar are clearly detected (&gt;10$\sigma$), as well as the so-called bridge emission (5.7$\sigma$). We find that both peaks are well described by power laws, with spectral indices of $\sim$3.44 and $\sim$3.03 respectively. The joint analysis of Fermi-LAT and LST-1 data shows a good agreement between both instruments in the overlapping energy range. The detailed results obtained in the first observations of the Crab pulsar with LST-1 show the potential that CTAO will have to study this type of sources.</description>

      <title>Physics of 1 keV line in X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray binaries (XRBs) often exhibit spectral residuals in the 0.5 to 2 keV range, known as the "1 keV residual/1 keV feature", with variable centroid and intensity across different systems. Yet a comprehensive scientific explanation of the variability of the 1 keV feature has remained largely elusive. In this paper, we explain for the first time the origin and variability of the 1 keV feature in XRBs using the spectral synthesis code \textsc{Cloudy}. We constructed line blends for the emission and absorption lines and study the variability of these blends with ionization parameters, temperature, and column density. We conducted a sample study involving five XRBs including two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): NGC 247 ULX-1, NGC 1313 X-1, a binary X-ray pulsar: Hercules X-1, and two typical low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs): Cygnus X-2, and Serpens X-1, providing a comprehensive explanation of the 1 keV feature observed across these targets.</description>

      <title>A new subclass of gamma-ray burst originating from compact binary merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type I gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from compact binary merger usually with duration less than 2 seconds for the main emission. However, recent observations of GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A indicate that some merger-origin GRBs could last much longer. Since they show strikingly similar properties (indicating a common mechanism) which are different from the classic "long"-short burst (e.g. GRB 060614), forming an interesting subclass of type I GRBs, we suggest to name them as type IL GRBs. By identifying the first peak of GRB 230307A as a quasi-thermal precursor, we find that the prompt emission of type IL GRB is composed of three episodes: (1) a precursor followed by a short quiescent (or weak emission) period, (2) a long-duration main emission, and (3) an extended emission. With this burst pattern, a good candidate, GRB 170228A, was found in the Fermi/GBM archive data, and subsequent temporal and spectral analyses indeed show that GRB 170228A falls in the same cluster with GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A in many diagnostic figures. Thus this burst pattern could be a good reference for rapidly identifying type IL GRB and conducting low-latency follow-up observation. We estimated the occurrence rate and discussed the physical origins and implications for the three emission episodes of type IL GRBs. Our analysis suggests the pre-merger precursor model, especially the super flare model, is more favored for type IL GRBs.</description>

      <title>The influence of the 3D Galactic gas structure on cosmic-ray transport and gamma-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) play a major role in the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM). Their interactions and transport ionize, heat, and push the ISM thereby coupling different regions of it. The spatial distribution of CRs depends on the distribution of their sources as well as the ISM constituents they interact with, such as gas, starlight, and magnetic fields. Particularly, gas interacts closely with CRs, influencing CR fluxes and gamma -ray emission. We illustrate the influence of 3D gas structures on CR transport and gamma -ray emission. We use the PICARD code and multiple samples of recent 3D reconstructions of the HI and H$_2$ Galactic gas constituents to investigate the impact on the transport of CRs and emission of gamma -rays. We find the necessary transport parameters to reproduce local measurements of CR fluxes, and see that they depend on the local distribution of gas density and structure. The distribution of CR fluxes exhibits energy-dependent structures that vary for all CR species due to their corresponding loss processes. Regions of enhanced secondary (primary) species are spatially correlated (anti-correlated) with the gas density. We observe a high sensitivity of the gamma -ray emission on the contrast of gas structures, as those determine the 3D spatial distributions of hadronic interactions and bremsstrahlung. We find that corresponding gas-induced structures in the distribution of CR electrons are also visible in Inverse Compton (IC) emission. Due to the aforementioned sensitivity, the analysis of CR data for CR sources and transport parameters requires the usage of accurate 3D gas maps.</description>

      <title>A new bump in the night: evidence of a new feature in the binary black hole mass distribution at $70~M_{\odot}$ from gravitational-wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the confident binary black hole (BBH) detections from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) with an alternative mass population model in order to capture features in the mass distribution beyond the Powerlaw + Peak model. We find that the peak of a second power law characterizes the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ bump, such that the data marginally prefers a mixture of two power laws for the mass distribution of binary components over a Powerlaw + Peak model with a Bayes Factor $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}$ of 0.1. This result may imply that the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ feature represents the onset of a second population of BBH mergers (e.g. from a dynamical formation channel) rather than a specific mass feature over a broader distribution. When an additional Gaussian bump is allowed within our power law mixture model, we find a new feature in the BH mass spectrum at $\sim65-70~M_\odot$. This new feature may be consistent with hierarchical mergers, and constitute $\sim2\%$ of the BBH population. This model also recovers a maximum mass of $58^{+30}_{-14}~M_\odot$ for the second power law, consistent with the onset of a pair-instability supernova mass gap.</description>

      <title>Mirages and Large TeV Halo-Pulsar Offsets from Cosmic Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of extended $\gamma$-ray sources usually assumes symmetric diffusion of cosmic rays. However, recent observations of multiple sources near single pulsars and significant offsets between TeV halo centroids and their parent pulsars suggest that this assumption is overly simplistic. In this Letter, we demonstrate that asymmetric propagation of cosmic rays near their accelerators may create multiple TeV sources instead of a single symmetric source. This mechanism also explains the large offsets between TeV halo centroids and their pulsars. We demonstrate that several perplexing detected sources can be naturally explained without invoking additional invisible accelerators.</description>

      <title>Cosmic accretion shocks as a tool to measure the dark matter mass of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the Universe. These shocks, and their features, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play during galaxy cluster formation. Studying a sample of simulated galaxy clusters and their associated accretion shocks, we show that objects in our sample sit in a plane within the three dimensional-space of cluster total mass, shock radius, and Mach number (a measure of shock intensity). Using this relation, and considering that forthcoming new observations will be able to measure shock radii and intensities, we put forward the idea that the dark matter content of galaxy clusters could be indirectly measured with an error up to around 30 per cent at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This procedure would be a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a novel constraint to the accepted $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Raining on DUNE and Other Large Volume Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct detection is a powerful means of searching for particle physics evidence of dark matter (DM) heavier than about a GeV with $\mathcal O(kiloton)$ volume, low-threshold detectors. In many scenarios, some fraction of the DM may be boosted to large velocities enhancing and generally modifying possible detection signatures. We investigate the scenario where 100% of the DM is boosted at the Earth due to new attractive long-range forces. This leads to two main improvements in detection capabilities: 1) the large boost allows for detectable signatures of DM well below a GeV at large-volume neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO, as possible DM detectors, and 2) the flux at the Earth's surface is enhanced by a focusing effect. In addition, the model leads to a significant anisotropy in the signal with the DM flowing dominantly vertically at the Earth's surface instead of the typical approximately isotropic DM signal. We develop the theory behind this model and also calculate realistic constraints using a detailed GENIE simulation of the signal inside detectors.</description>

      <title>Constraining Fundamental Constants with Fast Radio Bursts: Unveiling the Role of Energy Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding physical mechanisms relies on the accurate determination of fundamental constants, although inherent limitations in experimental techniques introduce uncertainties into these measurements. This paper explores the uncertainties associated with measuring the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$) and the proton-to-electron mass ratio ($\mu$) using observed fast radio bursts (FRBs). We select 50 localized FRBs to quantify the effects of varying this fundamental coupling on the relation between dispersion measure and redshift. By leveraging independent measurements of dispersion measures and redshifts of these FRBs, we constrain the uncertainties in $\alpha$ and $\mu$ approximately to $\Delta\alpha/\alpha=1.99\times 10^{-5}$ and $\Delta\mu/\mu=-1.00\times 10^{-5}$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Remarkably, these constraints improve nearly an order-of-magnitude when considering a dynamical dark energy model. This investigation not only yields one of the most stringent constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$ to date but also emphasizes the criticality of accounting for the energy scale of the system when formulating constraints on fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between two exact gravitational lens equations in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virbhadra and Ellis have proposed an exact equation (referred to as VE equation) for the gravitational lens in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime [Phys. Rev. D 62,084003 (2000)], whereas an improved equation (referred to as BTOA equation) has been derived by Bozza [Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)] and later by Takizawa, Ono and Asada [Phys. Rev. D, 102, 064060 (2020)]. VE and BTOA equations seem to be very different from each other. The present paper shows that there exists an unphysical branch in VE equation. Consequently, VE equation can be reduced by removing the unphysical branch. The reduced version of VE equation is found to be the same as BTOA equation when a suitable transformation is made between the deflection angles defined differently in the two formulations. An explicit expression of the transformation is found. We also argue possible numerical errors when the transformation between the deflection angles is ignored.</description>

      <title>The coherent magnetic halo of Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent catalog of Faraday rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic sources together with the synchrotron polarization data from WMAP and Planck provide us with the wealth of information on magnetic fields of the Galaxy. However, the integral character of these observables together with our position inside the Galaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF) complicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of the GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field of the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside of the thin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and polarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of errors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is uniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account individual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations in the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease of the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model content. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data. We found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the RM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked out. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to previous approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble our model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time we showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The pitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20 degrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of arms inferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.</description>

      <title>SKA sensitivity for possible radio emission from dark matter in Omega Centauri</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Omega Centauri, the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way, is believed to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy's core. Giving its potential abundance of dark matter (DM), it is an attractive target for investigating the nature of this elusive substance in our local environment. Our study demonstrates that by observing Omega Centauri with the SKA for 1000 hours, we can detect synchrotron radio or Inverse Compton (IC) emissions from the DM annihilation products. It enables us to constrain the cross-section of DM annihilation down to $\sim {\rm 10^{-30}~cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for DM mass from several $\rm{GeV}$ to $\rm{100~GeV}$, which is much stronger compared with other observations. Additionally, we explore the axion, another well-motivated DM candidate, and provide stimulated decay calculations. It turns out that the sensitivity can reach $g_{\rm{a\gamma\gamma}} \sim 10^{-10} ~\rm{GeV^{-1}}$ for $2\times 10^{-7} ~\rm{eV} &lt; m_a &lt; 2\times 10^{-4} ~\rm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>The afterglow of GW170817 from every angle: Prospects for detecting the afterglows of binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date GW170817, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, is the only gravitational wave event with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. It was associated with a prompt short gamma-ray burst (GRB), an optical kilonova, and the afterglow of a structured, off-axis relativistic jet. We model the prospects for future mergers discovered in gravitational waves to produce detectable afterglows. Using a model fit to GW170817, we assume all BNS mergers produce jets with the same parameters, and model the afterglow luminosity for a full distribution of observer angles, ISM densities, and distances. We find that in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4 run, 30% - 45% of BNS mergers with a well-localized counterpart will have an afterglow detectable with current instrumentation in the X-ray, radio and optical. Without a previously detected counterpart, 10% - 15% will have an afterglow detectable by wide-area radio and optical surveys, compared to only about 5% - 12% of events expected to have bright (on-axis) gamma-ray emission. Most afterglows that are detected will be from off-axis jets. Further in the future, in the A+ era (O5), 40% - 50% of mergers will have afterglows detectable with next-generation X-ray and radio instruments. Future wide-area radio survey instruments, particularly DSA-2000, could detect 40% of afterglows, even without a kilonova counterpart. Finding and monitoring these afterglows will provide valuable insight into the structure and diversity of relativistic jets, the rate at which mergers produce jets, and constrain the angle of the mergers relative to our line of sight.</description>

      <title>Mirror QCD phase transition as the origin of the nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16769v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently provided strong evidence for a nHz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). Here we investigate the implications of a first-order phase transition occurring within the early universe's dark quantum chromodynamics (dQCD) epoch, specifically within the framework of the mirror twin Higgs dark sector model. Our analysis indicates a distinguishable SGWB signal originating from this phase transition, which can explain the measurements obtained by PTAs. Remarkably, a significant portion of the parameter space for the SGWB signal also effectively resolves the existing tensions in both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ measurements in Cosmology. This intriguing correlation suggests a possible common origin of these three phenomena for $0.2 &lt; \Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0.5$, where the mirror dark matter component constitutes about $30\%$ of the total dark matter abundance. Next generation CMB experiment such as CMB-S4 is able to test this parameter region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the whole 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 with Insight-HXMT data. We focus our study on the temporal evolution of the parameters of the source. We employ two different models to fit the disk's thermal spectrum: the Newtonian model DISKBB and the relativistic model NKBB. These two models provide different pictures of the source in the soft state. With DISKBB, we find that the inner edge of the disk is close to the innermost stable circular orbit of a fast-rotating black hole and the corona changes geometry from the hard to the soft state. With NKBB, we find that the disk is truncated in the soft state and that the coronal geometry does not change significantly during the whole outburst. However, the model with NKBB can predict an untruncated disk around a fast-rotating black hole if we assume that the disk inclination angle is around $30^\circ$ (instead of $\sim 60^\circ$, which is the inclination angle of the jet and is usually adopted as the disk inclination angle in the literature) and we employ a high-density reflection model. In such a case, we measure a high value of the black hole spin parameter with observations in the soft state, in agreement with the high spin value found from the analysis of the reflection features and in disagreement with the low spin value found by previous continuum-fitting method measurements with the disk inclination angle set to the value of the jet inclination angle.</description>

      <title>Rapid Identification and Classification of Eccentric Gravitational Wave Inspirals with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current templated searches for gravitational waves (GWs) emanated from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) assume that the binaries have circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. However, certain formation channels predict that in future observing runs (O4 and beyond), a fraction of detectable binaries could enter the sensitivity band with a measurable eccentricity $e$. Constraining $e$ for each GW event with Bayesian parameter estimation methods is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This motivates the need for a machine learning based identification and classification scheme, which could weed out the majority of GW events as non-eccentric and drastically reduce the set of candidate eccentric GWs. As a proof of principle, we train a separable-convolutional neural network (SCNN) with spectrograms of synthetic GWs added to Gaussian noise characterized by O4 representative \texttt{PSD}s. We use the trained network to (i) segregate candidates as either eccentric or non-eccentric (henceforth called the detection problem) and (ii) classify the events as non-eccentric $(e = 0)$, moderately eccentric $(e \in (0, 0.2])$, and highly eccentric $(e \in (0.2, 0.5])$. On the detection problem, our best performing network detects eccentricity with $0.914$ accuracy and true and false positive rates of $0.862$ and $0.138$, respectively. On the classification problem, the best performing network classifies signals with $0.853$ accuracy. We find that our trained detector displays close to ideal behavior for the data we consider.</description>

      <title>Peregrine: Sequential simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current and upcoming generations of gravitational wave experiments represent an exciting step forward in terms of detector sensitivity and performance. For example, key upgrades at the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA facilities will see the next observing run (O4) probe a spatial volume around four times larger than the previous run (O3), and design implementations for e.g. the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and LISA experiments are taking shape to explore a wider frequency range and probe cosmic distances. In this context, however, a number of very real data analysis problems face the gravitational wave community. For example, it will be crucial to develop tools and strategies to analyse (amongst other scenarios) signals that arrive coincidentally in detectors, longer signals that are in the presence of non-stationary noise or other shorter transients, as well as noisy, potentially correlated, coherent stochastic backgrounds. With these challenges in mind, we develop peregrine, a new sequential simulation-based inference approach designed to study broad classes of gravitational wave signal. In this work, we describe the method and implementation, before demonstrating its accuracy and robustness through direct comparison with established likelihood-based methods. Specifically, we show that we are able to fully reconstruct the posterior distributions for every parameter of a spinning, precessing compact binary coalescence using one of the most physically detailed and computationally expensive waveform approximants (SEOBNRv4PHM). Crucially, we are able to do this using only 2% of the waveform evaluations that are required in e.g. nested sampling approaches. Finally, we provide some outlook as to how this level of simulation efficiency and flexibility in the statistical analysis could allow peregrine to tackle these current and future gravitational wave data analysis problems.</description>

      <title>A JWST Medium Resolution MIRI Spectrum and Models of the Type Ia supernova 2021aefx at +415 d</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum (5-27 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021aefx at $+415$ days past $B$-band maximum. The spectrum, which was obtained during the iron-dominated nebular phase, has been analyzed in combination with previous JWST observations of SN 2021aefx, to provide the first JWST time series analysis of an SN Ia. We find the temporal evolution of the [Co III] 11.888 $\mathrm{\mu}$m feature directly traces the decay of $^{56}$Co. The spectra, line profiles, and their evolution are analyzed with off-center delayed-detonation models. Best fits were obtained with White Dwarf (WD) central densities of $\rho_c=0.9-1.1\times 10^9$g cm$^{-3}$, a WD mass of M$_{\mathrm{WD}}$=1.33-1.35M$_\odot$, a WD magnetic field of $\approx10^6$G, and an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition at $\approx$ 0.5 $M_\odot$ seen opposite to the line of sight of the observer (-30). The inner electron capture core is dominated by energy deposition from $\gamma$-rays whereas a broader region is dominated by positron deposition, placing SN 2021aefx at +415 d in the transitional phase of the evolution to the positron-dominated regime. The formerly `flat-tilted' profile at 9 $\mathrm{\mu}$m now has significant contribution from [Ni IV], [Fe II], and [Fe III] and less from [Ar III], which alters the shape of the feature as positrons excite mostly the low-velocity Ar. Overall, the strength of the stable Ni features in the spectrum is dominated by positron transport rather than the Ni mass. Based on multi-dimensional models, our analysis is consistent with a single-spot, close-to-central ignition with an indication for a pre-existing turbulent velocity field, and excludes a multiple-spot, off-center ignition.</description>

      <title>Impact of a plasma on the relaxation of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our universe is permeated with interstellar plasma, which prevents propagation of low-frequency electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that two dramatic consequences arise out of such suppression; (i) if plasma permeates the light ring of a black hole, electromagnetic modes are screened entirely from the gravitational-wave signal, changing the black hole spectroscopy paradigm; (ii) if a near vacuum cavity is formed close to a charged black hole, as expected for near equal-mass mergers, ringdown "echoes" are excited. The amplitude of such echoes decays slowly and could thus serve as a silver bullet for plasmas near charged black holes.</description>

      <title>The miniJPAS Survey: The radial distribution of star formation rates in faint X-ray active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of black hole nuclear activity on both the global and radial star formation rate (SFR) profiles in X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the field of miniJPAS, the precursor of the much wider J-PAS project. Our sample includes 32 AGN with z &lt; 0.3 detected via the XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys. For comparison, we assembled a control sample of 71 star-forming (SF) galaxies with similar magnitudes, sizes, and redshifts.
  To derive the global properties of both the AGN and the control SF sample, we used CIGALE to fit the spectral energy distributions derived from the 56 narrowband and 4 broadband filters from miniJPAS. We find that AGN tend to reside in more massive galaxies than their SF counterparts. After matching samples based on stellar mass and comparing their SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs), no significant differences appear. This suggests that the presence of AGN does not strongly influence overall star formation.
  However, when we used miniJPAS as an integral field unit (IFU) to dissect galaxies along their position angle, a different picture emerges. We find that AGN tend to be more centrally concentrated in mass with respect to SF galaxies. Moreover, we find a suppression of the sSFR up to 1Re and then an enhancement beyond 1Re , strongly contrasting with the decreasing radial profile of sSFRs in SF galaxies. This could point to an inside-out quenching of AGN host galaxies. These findings suggest that the reason we do not see differences on a global scale is because star formation is suppressed in the central regions and enhanced in the outer regions of AGN host galaxies. While limited in terms of sample size, this work highlights the potential of the upcoming J-PAS as a wide-field low-resolution IFU for thousands of nearby galaxies and AGN.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, can probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis in a distinctive way.</description>
