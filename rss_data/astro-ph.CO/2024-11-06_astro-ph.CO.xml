      <title>Model-independent cosmology with joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger (MM) observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers provide a promising approach to trace the distance-redshift relation, crucial for understanding the expansion history of the Universe and, consequently, testing the nature of Dark Energy (DE). While the gravitational wave (GW) signal offers a direct measure of the distance to the source, high-energy observatories can detect the electromagnetic counterpart and drive the optical follow-up providing the redshift of the host galaxy. In this work, we exploit up-to-date catalogs of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) supposedly coming from BNS mergers observed by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, to construct a large set of mock MM data. We explore how combinations of current and future generations of GW observatories operating under various underlying cosmological models would be able to detect GW signals from these GRBs. We achieve the reconstruction of the GW parameters by means of a novel prior-informed Fisher matrix approach. We then use these mock data to perform an agnostic reconstruction of the DE phenomenology, thanks to a machine learning method based on forward modeling and Gaussian Processes (GP). Our study highlights the paramount importance of observatories capable of detecting GRBs and identifying their redshift. In the best-case scenario, the GP constraints are 1.5 times more precise than those produced by classical parametrizations of the DE evolution. We show that, in combination with forthcoming cosmological surveys, fewer than 40 GW-GRB detections will enable unprecedented precision on $H_\mathrm{0}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and accurately reconstruct the DE density evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does the Redshift Evolution of the Mass Function Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings demonstrate that, despite large variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the mass function remains redshift-independent, allowing a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant - sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Continuous Cosmological Fields from Discrete Tracers with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid GNN-CNN architecture for the reconstruction of 3-dimensional continuous cosmological matter fields from discrete point clouds, provided by observed galaxy catalogs. Using the CAMELS hydrodynamical cosmological simulations we demonstrate that the proposed architecture allows for an accurate reconstruction of both the dark matter and electron density given observed galaxies and their features. Our approach includes a learned grid assignment scheme that improves over the traditional cloud-in-cell method. Our method can improve cosmological analyses in situations where non-luminous (and thus unobservable) continuous fields need to be estimated from luminous (observable) discrete point cloud tracers.</description>

      <title>Radially-polarized synchrotron from galaxy-cluster virial shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-to-$\gamma$-ray signals, recently found narrowly confined near the characteristic $2.4R_{500}$ scaled radii of galaxy clusters and groups, have been associated with their virial (structure-formation accretion) shocks based on spectro-spatial characteristics. By stacking high-latitude GMIMS radio data around MCXC galaxy clusters, we identify ($3\sigma$-$4\sigma$) excess radially-polarized emission at the exact same scaled radius, providing directional support, and indicating tangential magnetic fields induced by the shocked inflow. The results suggest a strong mass dependence, a flat energy spectrum, and a high polarization fraction, consistent with synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by strong virial shocks. The narrow radial range of such stacked virial-shock signals suggests that although the shocks are theorized to have diverse, irregular morphologies, they share similar $\sim 2.4R_{500}$ minimal radii.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Measures of Fast Radio Bursts through the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion measures (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) probe the density of electrons in the intergalactic medium (IGM) along their lines-of-sight, including the average density versus distance to the source and its variations in direction. While previous study focused on low-redshift, FRBs are potentially detectable out to high redshift, where their DMs can, in principle, probe the epoch of reionization (EOR) and its patchiness. We present the first predictions from large-scale, radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of fully-coupled galaxy formation and reionization, using Cosmic Dawn (``CoDa")~II to model the density and ionization fields of the universe down to redshifts through the end of the EOR at $z_{re}\approx6.1$. Combining this with an N-body simulation CoDa~II--Dark Matter of the fully-ionized epoch from the EOR to the present, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of FRB DMs as functions of their source redshift. The mean and standard deviation of DM increase with redshift, reaching a plateau by $z(x_{HII}\lesssim0.25)\gtrsim8$, i.e. well above $z_{re}$. The mean-DM asymptote $\mathcal{DM}_{max} \approx 5900~\mathrm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$ reflects the end of the EOR and its duration. The standard deviation there is $\sigma_{DM, max}\approx497 ~\mathrm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$, reflecting inhomogeneities of both patchy reionization and density. Inhomogeneities in ionization during the EOR contribute $\mathcal{O}(1$ per cent) of this value of $\sigma_{DM,max}$ from FRBs at redshifts $z\gtrsim 8$. Current estimates of FRB rates suggest this may be detectable within a few years of observation.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on neutrino mass from CSST galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of next-generation surveys, constraints on cosmological parameters are anticipated to become more stringent, particularly for the total neutrino mass. This study forecasts these constraints utilizing galaxy clusters from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Employing Fisher matrix analysis, we derive the constraint $\sigma(M_\nu)$ from cluster number counts, cluster power spectrum, and their combination. The investigation ranges from the standard cosmological model with neutrinos $\nu\Lambda$CDM to the inclusion of dynamic dark energy in the $\nu w_0 w_a$CDM model, revealing a minor impact of dark energy on neutrino constraints. We examine the largest source of systematic uncertainty arising from the mass-observable relation and find that, with perfect knowledge of the scaling relation parameters, CSST clusters have the potential to enhance precision, tightening constraints to $0.034$ eV. We also study the effects of the maximum redshift $z_{max}$ and other uncertainties, including redshift, halo mass function, and bias. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of accounting for the growth-induced scale-dependent bias (GISDB) effect, which is expected to have an impact of 1.5 to 2.2 times on the final constraint.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity in CMB lensing from full-sky simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lensing convergence field describing the weak lensing effect of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is expected to be subject to mild deviations from Gaussianity. We perform a suite of full-sky lensing simulations using ray tracing through multiple lens planes - generated by combining $N$-body simulations on smaller scales and low-to-intermediate redshifts with realisations of Gaussian random fields on large scales and at high redshifts. We quantify the non-Gaussianity of the resulting convergence fields in terms of a set of skewness and kurtosis parameters and show that the non-Gaussian information in these maps can be used to constrain cosmological parameters such as the cold dark matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{c} h^2$ or the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbations $A_\mathrm{s}$. We forecast that for future CMB lensing observations, combining the non-Gaussian parameters with the Gaussian information can increase constraining power on $(\Omega_\mathrm{c} h^2, A_\mathrm{s})$ by $30$-$40\%$ compared to constraints from Gaussian observables alone. We make the simulation code for the full-sky lensing simulation available for download from GitHub.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultralight scalar dark matter couplings with the European Pulsar Timing Array second data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) offer an independent method for searching for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), whose wavelike nature induces periodic oscillations in the arrival times of radio pulses. In addition to this gravitational effect, the direct coupling between ULDM and ordinary matter results in pulsar spin fluctuations and reference clock shifts, leading to observable effects in PTAs. The second data release from the European PTA (EPTA) indicates that ULDM cannot account for all dark matter in the mass range $m_{\phi} \in [10^{-24.0}, 10^{-23.3}] \text{ eV}$ based solely on gravitational effects. In this work, we derive constraints on the coupling coefficients by considering both gravitational and coupling effects. Our results demonstrate that EPTA provides stronger constraints on these couplings than previous PTA experiments, and it establishes similar or even tighter constraints compared to other precise experiments, such as atomic clock experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\mu$ and $y$ distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background with COBE/FIRAS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to constrain the $\mu$- and y- distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the COBE/FIRAS data. The analysis draws from the concept of blackbody radiation inversion (BRI), a mathematical technique typically used to determine the temperature distribution from a radiated power spectrum. We study the deviations from the ideal blackbody spectrum or the spectral distortions by incorporating first a non-zero chemical potential $\mu$ via the Bose-Einstein distribution and then the Compton parameter $y$ while keeping the monopole temperature constant. We infer the results as probability distribution functions on these distortions. Finally, we derive $\mu = (8.913 \pm 0.736) \times 10^{-5}$ and $y = (1.532 \pm 0.092) \times 10^{-5}$ at a $68\%$ confidence interval. The results are consistent with prior values and provide tighter constraints on the CMB spectral distortion and synergies of the primordial Universe.</description>

      <title>Mass &amp; Light in Galaxy Clusters: Parametric Strong Lensing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric strong lensing studies of galaxy clusters often display misleading features: group/cluster scale dark matter components without any stellar counterpart, offsets between both components larger than what might be allowed by neither Cold Dark Matter nor self interacting Dark Matter models, or significant unexplained external shear components. I am revisiting mass models where such misleading (and interesting) features have been reported, adopting the following working hypothesis: any group or cluster scale dark matter clump introduced in the modelling should be associated with a luminous counterpart, and any well motivated and reliable prior should be considered, even when this degrades the fit. The goal is to derive a physically motivated description of the dark matter component which might be compared to theoretical expectations. I succeed doing so in galaxy clusters AS 1063, MACS J0416 and MACS J1206, finding that the shape of the inner dark matter component has a flat density profile. These findings may be useful for the interpretation within dark matter scenario, such as self-interacting dark matter. I fail in Abell 370: a three dark matter clumps mass model (each clump being associated with its stellar counterpart) is unable to reproduce the observational constraints with a precision smaller than 2.3 arcsec. In order to provide a sub arcsec precision, I need to describe the dark matter distribution using a four dark matter clumps model, as found in earlier works. Examining the total projected mass maps, I however find a good agreement between the total mass and the stellar distribution in Abell 370, both being, to first order, bimodal. I interpret the misleading features as being symptomatic of the lack of realism of a parametric description of the dark matter distribution. I encourage caution and criticism on the outputs of parametric strong lensing modelling.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Bayesian inference methods using the Loreli II database of hydro-radiative simulations of the 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the observation of the 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization is an instrumental challenge, the interpretation of a prospective detection is still open to questions regarding the modelling of the signal and the Bayesian inference techniques that bridge the gap between theory and observations. To address some of these questions, we present Loreli II, a database of nearly 10 000 simulations of the 21 cm signal run with the Licorice 3D radiative transfer code. With Loreli II, we explore a 5-dimensional astrophysical parameter space where star formation, X-ray emissions, and UV emissions are varied. We then use this database to train neural networks and perform Bayesian inference on 21 cm power spectra affected by thermal noise at the level of 100 hours of observation with the Square Kilometer Array. We study and compare three inference techniques : an emulator of the power spectrum, a Neural Density Estimator that fits the implicit likelihood of the model, and a Bayesian Neural Network that directly fits the posterior distribution. We measure the performances of each method by comparing them on a statistically representative set of inferences, notably using the principles of Simulation-Based Calibration. We report errors on the 1-D marginalized posteriors (biases and over/under confidence) below $15 \%$ of the standard deviation for the emulator and below $25 \%$ for the other methods. We conclude that at our noise level and our sampling density of the parameter space, an explicit Gaussian likelihood is sufficient. This may not be the case at lower noise level or if a denser sampling is used to reach higher accuracy. We then apply the emulator method to recent HERA upper limits and report weak constraints on the X-ray emissivity parameter of our model.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: to be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on primordial magnetic fields from spectral distortions of cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-hydrodynamic decay of primordial magnetic fields can distort the black-body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by draining magnetic energy into thermal plasmas and photons. The current limits on CMB distortion place constraints on small-scale primordial magnetic fields. The constraints crucially depend on the decay laws of primordial magnetic fields. Recent numerical simulations reveal that non-linear effects play a significant role in the magnetic field decay although these effects are neglected in previous works. In this paper, by adopting a reconnection-driven turbulent decay as a non-linear evolution model, we demonstrate the potential impact of non-linear effects on CMB spectral distortions. The reconnection-driven turbulent decay model is an analytical description which provides the consistent results with numerical simulation. Our results rule out magnetic fields with shorter coherence lengths. While the result is independent of the spectral index of the magnetic energy spectrum, it is influenced by the magnetic helicity fraction.</description>

      <title>Line of Sight Bias in Dark Matter Inferences from Galaxy Cluster Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collisions of galaxy clusters, the lack of displacement between dark matter and galaxies suggests that the dark matter scattering depth is small. This yields an upper limit on the dark matter cross section if the dark matter column density is known. We investigate a bias in such constraints: the measured column density (along the line of sight, using gravitational lensing) is lower than that experienced by a dark matter particle, as follows. Dark matter halos are triaxial and generally collide along their major axes, yielding a high scattering column density -- but the merger is obvious only to observers whose line of sight is nearly perpendicular to that axis, yielding a low observed column density. We trace lines of sight through merging halos from the BigMDPL n-body simulation, both with and without mock observational effects. We find that a hypothetical skewer through the halo along the merger axis (more precisely, along the current separation vector of the two halos) has twice the column density of a typical line of sight. With weak lensing measurements, which involve some spatial averaging, this ratio is reduced to 1.25, suggesting that existing constraints on the scattering cross section are biased high by about 25%.</description>

      <title>Rapid identification of time-frequency domain gravitational wave signals from binary black holes using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19003v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in deep learning techniques have offered an alternative and complementary approach to traditional matched filtering methods for the identification of gravitational wave (GW) signals. The rapid and accurate identification of GW signals is crucial for the progress of GW physics and multi-messenger astronomy, particularly in light of the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In this work, we use the 2D U-Net algorithm to identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers. We simulate BBH mergers with component masses from 5 to 80 $M_{\odot}$ and account for the LIGO detector noise. We find that the GW events in the first and second observation runs could all be clearly and rapidly identified. For the third observing run, about $80\%$ GW events could be identified. In particular, GW190814, currently unknown, is a special case that can be identified by the network, while other binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers can not be identified. Compared to the traditional convolutional neural network, the U-Net algorithm can output the time-frequency domain signal images rather than probabilities, providing a more intuitive investigation. Moreover, some of the results through U-Net can provide preliminary inference on the chirp mass information. In conclusion, the U-Net algorithm can rapidly identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from BBH mergers and potentially be helpful for future parameter inferences.</description>

      <title>New physics decaying into metastable particles: impact on cosmic neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate decays of hypothetical unstable new physics particles into metastable species such as muons, pions, or kaons in the early Universe, when temperatures are in the MeV range, and study how they affect cosmic neutrinos. We demonstrate that decays of the metastable particles compete with their annihilations and interactions with nucleons, which reduces the production of high-energy neutrinos and increases energy injection into the electromagnetic sector. This energy reallocation alters the impact of the new physics particles on the effective number of neutrino degrees of freedom, $N_{\text{eff}}$, modifies neutrino spectral distortions, and may induce asymmetries in neutrino and antineutrino energy distributions. These modifications have important implications for observables such as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background, especially in light of upcoming CMB observations aiming to reach percent-level precision on $N_{\rm eff}$. We illustrate our findings with a few examples of new physics particles and provide a computational tool available for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of metastable Standard Model particles from long-lived particle decays in the MeV primordial plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: e investigate the cosmological impact of hypothetical unstable new physics particles that decay in the MeV-scale plasma of the Early Universe. Focusing on scenarios where the decays produce metastable species such as muons, pions, and kaons, we systematically analyze the dynamics of these particles using coupled Boltzmann equations governing their abundances. Our results demonstrate that the metastable species can efficiently annihilate or interact with nucleons, which often leads to their disappearance prior to decay. The suppression of decay significantly alters the properties of cosmic neutrinos, impacting cosmological observables like Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. To support further studies, we provide a public Mathematica code that traces the evolution of these metastable particles and apply it to several new physics models.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Thermal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article provides the basics and discusses some important applications of thermal field theory, namely the combination of statistical mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory. In a first part the fundamentals are covered: the density matrix, the corresponding averages and the treatment of fields of various spin in a medium. A second part is dedicated to the computation of thermal Green's function for scalars, vectors and fermions with path-integral methods. These functions play a crucial role in thermal field theory, as explained here. A more applicative part of the review is dedicated to the production of particles in a medium and to phase transitions in field theory, including the process of vacuum decay in a general theory featuring a first-order phase transition. To understand this review, the reader should only have a good knowledge of non-statistical quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>The empirical laws of galaxy dynamics: from gas kinematics to weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies obey a set of strict dynamical laws, which imply a close coupling between the visible matter (stars and gas) and the observed dynamics (set by dark matter in the standard cosmological context). Here we review recent results from weak gravitational lensing, which allows studying the empirical laws of galaxy dynamics out to exceedingly large radii in both late-type galaxies (LTGs) and early-type galaxies (ETGs). We focus on three laws: (1) the circular velocity curves of both LTGs and ETGs remain indefinitely flat out to several hundreds of kpc; (2) the same baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is followed by LTGs and ETGs; (3) the same radial acceleration relation (RAR) is followed by LTGs and ETGs. Combining galaxy data with Solar System data, the RAR covers about 16 orders of magnitude in the Newtonian baryonic acceleration. Remarkably, these empirical facts were predicted a priori by MOND.</description>

      <title>Limits on Kaluza-Klein Portal Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenology of dark-matter (DM) scenarios within radius-stabilized Randall-Sundrum models. Specifically, we consider models where the dark matter candidates are Standard Model (SM) singlets confined to the TeV brane and interact with the SM via spin-2 and spin-0 gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We compute the thermal relic density of DM particles in these models by applying recent work showing that scattering amplitudes of massive spin-2 KK states involve an intricate cancellation between various diagrams. Considering the resulting DM abundance, collider searches, and the absence of a signal in direct DM detection experiments, we show that spin-2 KK portal DM models are highly constrained. We confirm that within the usual thermal freeze-out scenario, scalar dark matter models are essentially ruled out. In contrast, we show that fermion and vector dark matter models are viable in a region of parameter space in which dark matter annihilation through a KK graviton is resonant. Specifically, vector models are viable for dark matter masses ranging from 1.1 TeV to 5.5 TeV for theories in which the scale of couplings of the KK modes is of order 40 TeV or lower. Fermion dark matter models are viable for a similar mass region, but only for KK coupling scales of order 20 TeV. In this work, we provide a complete description of the calculations needed to arrive at these results and, in an appendix, a discussion of new KK-graviton couplings needed for the computations, which have not previously been discussed in the literature. Here, we focus on models in which the radion is light, and the back-reaction of the radion stabilization dynamics on the gravitational background can be neglected. The phenomenology of a model with a heavy radion and the consideration of the effects of the radion stabilization dynamics on the DM abundance are being addressed in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Timescales of Quasar Accretion Discs from Low to High Black Hole Masses and new Variability Structure Functions at the High Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UV-optical variability of quasars appears to depend on black-hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$ through physical timescales in the accretion disc. Here, we calculate mean emission radii, $R_{\rm mean}$, and orbital timescales, $t_{\rm orb}$, of thin accretion disc models as a function of emission wavelength from 1000 to 10000 Angstrom, $M_{\rm BH}$ from $10^6$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. At low $M_{\rm BH}$, we find the textbook behaviour of $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$ alongside $R_{\rm mean} \approx$ const, while towards higher masses the growing event horizon imposes $R_{\rm mean} \propto M_{\rm BH}$ and thus a turnover into $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}$. We fit smoothly broken power laws to the numerical results and provide analytic convenience functions for $R_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ and $t_{\rm orb}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ in terms of the observables $\lambda$, $M_{\rm BH}$, and the monochromatic luminosity $L_{3000}$. We then calculate variability structure functions for the ~2200 brightest quasars in the sky with estimates for $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{3000}$, using lightcurves from NASA/ATLAS orange passband spanning more than 7 years. The median luminosity of the accretion disc sample is $\log L_{\rm bol}/(\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1})\approx 47$ and the median $\log M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\approx 9.35$. At this high mass, the theoretical mass dependence of disc timescales levels off and turns over. The data show a weak dependence of variability on $M_{\rm BH}$ consistent with the turnover and a model where disc timescale drives variability amplitudes in the form $\log A/A_0=1/2\times\Delta t/t_{\rm orb}$, as suggested before. In the future, if the black-hole mass is known, observations of variability might be used as diagnostics of the physical luminosity in accretion discs, and therefore constrain inclination or dust extinction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review delves into the pivotal primordial stage of the universe, a period that holds the key to understanding its current state. To fully grasp this epoch, it is essential to consider three fundamental domains of physics: gravity, particle physics, and thermodynamics. The thermal history of the universe recreates the extreme high-energy conditions that are critical for exploring the unification of the fundamental forces, making it a natural laboratory for high-energy physics. This thermal history also offers valuable insights into how the laws of thermodynamics have governed the evolution of the universe's constituents, shaping them into the forms we observe today. Focusing on the Standard Cosmological Model (SCM) and the Standard Model of Particles (SM), this paper provides an in-depth analysis of thermodynamics in the primordial universe. The structure of the study includes an introduction to the SCM and its strong ties to thermodynamic principles. It then explores equilibrium thermodynamics in the context of the expanding universe, followed by a detailed analysis of out-of-equilibrium phenomena that were pivotal in shaping key events during the early stages of the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Semi-Symmetric Metric Gravity: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a review of the Semi-Symmetric Metric Gravity (SSMG) theory, representing a geometric extension of standard general relativity, based on a connection introduced by Friedmann and Schouten in 1924. The semi-symmetric connection is a connection that generalizes the Levi-Civita one, by allowing for the presence of a simple form of the torsion, described in terms of a torsion vector. The Einstein field equations are postulated to have the same form as in standard general relativity, thus relating the Einstein tensor constructed with the help of the semi-symmetric connection, with the energy-momentum tensor. The inclusion of the torsion contributions in the field equations has intriguing cosmological implications, particularly during the late-time evolution of the Universe. Presumably, these effects also dominate under high-energy conditions, and thus SSMG could potentially address unresolved issues in General Relativity and cosmology, such as the initial singularity, inflation, or the $^7$Li problem of the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. The explicit presence of torsion in the field equations leads to the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, which can be interpreted within the irreversible thermodynamics of open systems, as describing particle creation processes. We also review in detail the cosmological applications of the theory, and investigate the statistical tests for several models, by constraining the model parameters via comparison with several observational datasets.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos are neutral in the Standard Model, but they have tiny charge radii generated by radiative corrections. In theories Beyond the Standard Model, neutrinos can also have magnetic and electric moments and small electric charges (millicharges). We review the general theory of neutrino electromagnetic form factors, which reduce, for ultrarelativistic neutrinos and small momentum transfers, to the neutrino charges, effective charge radii, and effective magnetic moments. We discuss the phenomenology of these electromagnetic neutrino properties and we review the existing experimental bounds. We briefly review also the electromagnetic processes of astrophysical neutrinos and the neutrino magnetic moment portal in the presence of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups with simulation-informed scatter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the scaling relation between baryonic observables and dark matter halo properties is crucial not only for studying galaxy formation and evolution, but also for deriving accurate cosmological constraints from galaxy surveys. In this paper, we constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups identified by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, using weak lensing signals measured by the Kilo-Degree Survey. We compared our measured scaling relation with predictions from the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations and the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model. We find general agreement between our measurements and simulation predictions for haloes with masses ${\gtrsim}10^{13.5}\ h_{70}^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, but observe slight discrepancies with the FLAMINGO simulations at lower halo masses. We explored improvements to the current halo model framework by incorporating simulation-informed scatter in the group stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass. We find that including a simulation-informed scatter model tightens the constraints on scaling relations, despite the current data statistics being insufficient to directly constrain the variable scatter. We also tested the robustness of our results against different statistical models of miscentring effects from selected central galaxies. We find that accounting for miscentring is essential, but our current measurements do not distinguish among different miscentring models.</description>

      <title>The tidal evolution of anisotropic subhaloes: A new pathway to creating isotropic and cored satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.</description>

      <title>How the StarDICE photometric calibration of standard stars can improve cosmological constraints?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations will grow significantly within the next decade, mainly thanks to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) undertaken by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile. With this improvement, statistical uncertainties will decrease, and flux calibration will become the main uncertainty for the characterization of dark energy. Currently, the astronomical flux scale is anchored on the numerical models of white dwarf atmospheres from the CALSPEC catalog, and every error on the model can induce a bias over cosmological parameters inference. The StarDICE experiment proposes a new calibration reference that only relies on observations from the optical watt defined by the NIST towards the magnitude of standard stars. It is currently operating at l'Observatoire de Haute-Provence and has been collecting data since the beginning of 2023. To overcome the photometric calibration uncertainty and reach a sub-percent precision, the instrument throughput has been calibrated with a Collimated Beam Projector. It will be monitored on-site with a LED-based artificial star source calibrated with NIST photodiodes. In this proceeding, we will first illustrate how an error in the photometric calibration can impact the SNe Ia distance moduli and thus bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. Then we will present the StarDICE experiment and how we can recalibrate the CALSPEC catalog at the millimagnitude level on the NIST scale with photometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of two independent direction-dependent calibration algorithms on the LOFAR 21-cm signal power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) is challenging due to the strong astrophysical foregrounds, ionospheric effects, radio frequency interference and instrumental effects. Understanding and calibrating these effects are crucial for the detection. In this work, we introduce a newly developed direction-dependent (DD) calibration algorithm DDECAL and compare its performance with an existing algorithm, SAGECAL, in the context of the LOFAR-EoR 21-cm power spectrum experiment. In our data set, the North Celestial Pole (NCP) and its flanking fields were observed simultaneously. We analyse the NCP and one of its flanking fields. The NCP field is calibrated by the standard pipeline, using SAGECAL with an extensive sky model and 122 directions, and the flanking field is calibrated by DDECAL and SAGECAL with a simpler sky model and 22 directions. Additionally, two strategies are used for subtracting Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A. The results show that DDECAL performs better at subtracting sources in the primary beam region due to the application of a beam model, while SAGECAL performs better at subtracting Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A. This indicates that including a beam model during DD calibration significantly improves the performance. The benefit is obvious in the primary beam region. We also compare the 21-cm power spectra on two different fields. The results show that the flanking field produces better upper limits compared to the NCP in this particular observation. Despite the minor differences between DDECAL and SAGECAL due to the beam application, we find that the two algorithms yield comparable 21-cm power spectra on the LOFAR-EoR data after foreground removal. Hence, the current LOFAR-EoR 21-cm power spectrum limits are not likely to depend on the DD calibration method.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski Functional Analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background Weak Lensing Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minkowski functionals are summary statistics that capture the geometric and morphological properties of fields. They are sensitive to all higher order correlations of the fields and can be used to complement more conventional statistics, such as the power spectrum of the field. We develop a Minkowski functional-based approach for a full likelihood analysis of mildly non-Gaussian sky maps with partial sky coverage. Applying this to the inference of cosmological parameters from the Planck mission's map of the Cosmic Microwave Background's lensing convergence, we find an excellent agreement with results from the power spectrum-based lensing likelihood. While the non-Gaussianity of current CMB lensing maps is dominated by reconstruction noise, a Minkowski functional-based analysis may be able to extract cosmological information from the non-Gaussianity of future lensing maps and thus go beyond what is accessible with a power spectrum-based analysis. We make the numerical code for the calculation of a map's Minkowski functionals, skewness and kurtosis parameters available for download from GitHub.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a &gt;13 Mpc long X-ray filament between two galaxy clusters beyond three times their virial radii</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) eROSITA X-ray telescope has a superior response to extended soft X-rays, which makes it ideal for studying low X-ray surface brightness emission of cosmic filaments. We search for extended X-ray emission between the two nearby galaxy clusters Abell~3667 and Abell~3651, which are separated by a projected transverse distance of ${\sim}13\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, using data from the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. We performed a detailed X-ray image analysis of the region between the two galaxy clusters and conducted a redshift analysis of the sources between them. We carried out a thorough surface brightness and spectral analysis between the clusters. The analysis was complemented with an X-ray pointed observation from XMM-Newton, infrared 2MASS data, and redshift information from NED. We discover an emission filament beyond the known radio relic northwest of A3667 and even beyond three times its virial radius. It is smoothly connected to A3651. The X-ray emission in the direction of the filament shows an enhancement of $30\pm3\,\%$ with a significance of $11\,\sigma$. The 2MASS map and redshift analysis show an alignment of galaxies along the filament and make a projection effect unlikely. Taking the redshift progression of galaxies within the filament into account, we estimate its three-dimensional length to be in the range of $25\,\mathrm{Mpc} - 32\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. The surface brightness analysis in combination with the temperature $T=({0.91}_{-0.11}^{+0.07})\,\mathrm{keV}$ and metallicity $Z=({0.10}_{-0.08}^{+0.05})\,\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ from the spectral analysis leads to estimates of a total flux, gas mass, and central baryon overdensity of $F_\mathrm{X}= (7.4\pm1.2)\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, $M_\mathrm{g}=(2.7^{+1.4}_{-0.8})\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\delta_0=215^{+86}_{-50}$.</description>

      <title>Survival of Gas in Subhalos and Its Impact on the 21 cm Forest Signals: Insights from Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the survival of gas within subhalos under various astrophysical processes is crucial for elucidating cosmic structure formation and evolution. We study the resilience of gas in subhalos, focusing on the impact of tidal and ram pressure stripping through hydrodynamic simulations. Our results uncover significant gas stripping primarily driven by ram pressure effects, which also profoundly influence the gas distribution within these subhalos. Notably, despite their vulnerability to ram pressure effects, the low-mass subhalos can play a pivotal role in influencing the observable characteristics of cosmic structures due to their large abundance. Specifically, we explore the application of our findings to the 21 cm forest, showing how the survival dynamics of gas in subhalos can modulate the 21 cm optical depth, a key probe for detecting minihalos in the pre-reionization era. (abridged) In this work, we further investigate the contribution of subhalos to the 21 cm optical depth with hydrodynamics simulations, particularly highlighting the trajectories and fates of subhalos within mass ranges of \(10^{4-6} M_{\odot}h^{-1}\) in a host halo of \(10^7 M_{\odot}h^{-1}\). Despite their susceptibility to ram pressure stripping, the contribution of abundant low-mass subhalos to the 21-cm optical depth is more significant than that of their massive counterparts primarily due to their greater abundance. We find that the 21-cm optical depth can be increased by a factor of approximately two due to the abundant low-mass subhalos. (abridged) Our work provides critical insights into the gas dynamics within subhalos in the early Universe, highlighting their resilience against environmental stripping effects, and their impact on observable 21-cm signals.</description>

      <title>The importance of stochasticity in determining galaxy emissivities and UV LFs during cosmic dawn and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic nature of star formation and photon propagation in high-redshift galaxies can result in sizable galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in their properties. Ignoring this scatter by assuming mean quantities can bias estimates of their emissivity and corresponding observables. We construct a flexible, semi-empirical model, sampling scatter around the following mean relations: (i) the conditional halo mass function (CHMF); (ii) the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR); (iii) galaxy star formation main sequence (SFMS); (iv) fundamental metallicity relation (FMR); (v) conditional intrinsic luminosity; and (vi) photon escape fraction. In our fiducial model, ignoring scatter in these galaxy properties overestimates the duration of the EoR, delaying its completion by up to $\Delta z$ ~ 2. We quantify the relative importance of each of the above sources of scatter in determining the ionizing, soft-band X-ray and Lyman Werner (LW) emissivities as a function of scale and redshift. We find that scatter around the SFMS is important for all bands, especially at the highest redshifts where the emissivity is dominated by the faintest, most "bursty" galaxies. Ignoring this scatter would underestimate the mean emissivity and its standard deviation computed over 5 cMpc regions by factors of up to $\sim$2-10 at $5&lt; z &lt; 15$. Scatter around the X-ray luminosity to star formation rate relation is important for determining X-ray emissivity, accounting for roughly half of its mean and standard deviation. The importance of scatter in the ionizing escape fraction depends on its functional form, while scatter around the SHMR contributes at the level of ~10-20%. Although scatter does flatten the UV luminosity functions, shifting the bright end by 1-2 magnitudes, the level of scatter in our fiducial model is insufficient to fully explain recent estimates from JWST photometry (consistent with previous studies).</description>

      <title>Does the Amati Correlation Exhibit Redshift-Driven Heterogeneity in Long GRBs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer significant insights into cosmology due to their high energy emissions and the potential to probe the early universe. The Amati relation, which links the intrinsic peak energy to the isotropic energy, is crucial for understanding their cosmological applications. This study investigates the redshift-driven heterogeneity of the Amati correlation in long GRBs. Analyzing 221 long GRBs with redshifts from 0.034 to 8.2 we divided the dataset based on redshift thresholds of 1.5 and 2. Using Bayesian marginalization and Reichart's likelihood approach, we found significant differences in the Amati parameters between low and high redshift subgroups. These variations, differing by approximately $2\sigma$ at $z = 1.5$ and more than $1\sigma$ at $z = 2$, suggest an evolution in the GRB population with redshift, possibly reflecting changes in host galaxy properties. However, selection effects and instrumental biases may also contribute. Our results challenge the assumption of the Amati relation's universality and underscore the need for larger datasets and more precise measurements from upcoming missions like Transient High-Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor (THESEUS) and enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP) to refine our understanding of GRB physics.</description>

      <title>Pair Counting without Binning -- A New Approach to Correlation Functions in Clustering Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel perspective on correlation functions in the clustering analysis of the large-scale structure of the universe. We first recognise that pair counting in bins of radial separation is equivalent to evaluating counts-in-cells (CIC), which can be modelled using a filtered density field with a binning-window function. This insight leads to an in situ expression for the two-point correlation function (2PCF). Essentially, the core idea underlying our method is to introduce a window function to define the binning scheme, enabling pair-counting without binning. This approach develops a concept of generalised 2PCF, which extends beyond conventional discrete pair counting by accommodating non-sharp-edged window functions. To extend this framework to N-point correlation functions (NPCF) using current optimal edge-corrected estimators, we developed a binning scheme independent of the specific parameterisation of polyhedral configurations. In particular, we demonstrate a fast algorithm for the three-point correlation function (3PCF), where triplet counting is accomplished by assigning either a spherical tophat or a Gaussian filter to each vertex of triangles. Additionally, we derive analytical expressions for the 3PCF using a multipole expansion in Legendre polynomials, accounting for filtered field (binning) corrections. Numerical tests using several suites of N-body simulation samples show that our approach aligns remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. Our method provides an exact solution for quantifying binning effects in practical measurements and offers a high-speed algorithm, enabling high-order clustering analysis in extremely large datasets from ongoing and upcoming surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and DESI.</description>

      <title>Mass &amp; Light in Galaxy Clusters: The case of Abell 370</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric strong lensing studies of galaxy clusters often display "misleading features". This is the case in the galaxy cluster Abell 370. Using strong lensing techniques, it has been described parametrically by a four dark matter clumps model and galaxy scale perturbers, as well as a significant external shear component, which physical origin remains a challenge. The dark matter distribution features a mass clump with no stellar counterpart and a significant offset between one of the dark matter clumps and its associated stellar counterpart. In this paper, based on BUFFALO data, we begin by revisiting this mass model. We find a four dark matter clumps solution which does not require any external shear and provides a slightly better RMS compared to previous models. Investigating further this new solution, we present a class of models which can accurately reproduce the strong lensing data, but whose parameters for the dark matter component are poorly constrained. We then develop a model where each large scale dark matter component must be associated with a stellar counterpart. This model is unable to reproduce the observational constraints with an RMS smaller than 2.3", and the parameters describing this dark matter component remain poorly constrained. Examining the total projected mass maps, we find a good agreement between the total mass and the stellar distribution, both being bimodal. We interpret the "misleading features" of the four dark matter clumps mass model and the failure of the three dark matter clumps mass model as being symptomatic of the lack of realism of a parametric description of the dark matter distribution, and encourage caution and criticism on the outputs of parametric strong lensing modelling. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for using Abell 370 as a gravitational telescope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer occurs between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

Abstract: We present a candidate sensor for future spectroscopic applications, such as a Stage-5 Spectroscopic Survey Experiment or the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This type of charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor features multiple in-line amplifiers at its output stage allowing multiple measurements of the same charge packet, either in each amplifier or in the different amplifiers. Recently, the operation of an eight-amplifier sensor has been experimentally demonstrated, and we present the operation of a 16-amplifier sensor. This new sensor enables a noise level of ~1e-rms with a single sample per amplifier. In addition, it is shown that sub-electron noise can be achieved using multiple samples per amplifier. In addition to demonstrating the performance of the 16-amplifier sensor, we aim to create a framework for future analysis and performance optimization of this type of detectors. New models and techniques are presented to characterize specific parameters, which are absent in conventional CCDs and Skipper CCDs: charge transfer between amplifiers and independent and common noise in the amplifiers and their processing.</description>

Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a class of supersymmetric inflation models where the scalar component of a matter superfield, or a $D$-flat direction of matter fields, drives inflation. Similar to Hybrid inflation, the end of inflation is reached when a "waterfall field", which was stabilized during inflation at a field value where the scalar potential features a large vacuum energy, starts rapidly rolling towards its minimum where a symmetry group $G$ is spontaneously broken. In contrast to standard supersymmetric Hybrid inflation, where the inflaton is a gauge singlet, in Tribrid inflation it can be a gauge non-singlet, which, via its vacuum expectation value, already breaks the gauge symmetry. This raises the question whether topological defects can still form after inflation in this class of models, and if so, which types of defects are generated. We investigate this question systematically in realisations of Tribrid inflation where $G = U(1)$ and we analyse under which conditions cosmic strings form. We find that in the considered cases where domain walls form, these are only temporary and do not invalidate the model realisations. We also discuss how our results can be used to analyse models of Tribrid inflation associated with the final step of $SO(10)$ breaking, where cosmic strings can be metastable and provide a promising explanation of the recent PTA results hinting at a stochastic gravitational wave background at nanohertz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>

Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes, beyond energy exchange. Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions. We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B), dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates can be sizeable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere, a $\mathcal{O}(10^{21})$ enhancement compared to the incoherent contribution. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass. Using the Lindblad formalism, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>
