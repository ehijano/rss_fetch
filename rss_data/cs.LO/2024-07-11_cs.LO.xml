      <title>Completeness of Finitely Weighted Kleene Algebra With Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on \'Esik and Kuich's completeness result for finitely weighted Kleene algebra, we establish relational and language completeness results for finitely weighted Kleene algebra with tests. Similarly as \'Esik and Kuich, we assume that the finite semiring of weights is commutative, partially ordered and zero-bounded, but we also assume that it is integral. We argue that finitely weighted Kleene algebra with tests is a natural framework for equational reasoning about weighted programs in cases where an upper bound on admissible weights is assumed.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum of Approximate Probabilistic Bisimulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies various notions of approximate probabilistic bisimulation on labeled Markov chains (LMCs). We introduce approximate versions of weak and branching bisimulation, as well as a notion of $\varepsilon$-perturbed bisimulation that relates LMCs that can be made (exactly) probabilistically bisimilar by small perturbations of their transition probabilities. We explore how the notions interrelate and establish their connections to other well-known notions like $\varepsilon$-bisimulation.</description>

      <title>Validity of contextual formulas (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many well-known logical identities are naturally written as equivalences between contextual formulas. A simple example is the Boole-Shannon expansion $c[p] \equiv (p \wedge c[\mathrm{true}] ) \vee (\neg\, p \wedge c[\mathrm{false}] )$, where $c$ denotes an arbitrary formula with possibly multiple occurrences of a "hole", called a context, and $c[\varphi]$ denotes the result of "filling" all holes of $c$ with the formula $\varphi$. Another example is the unfolding rule $\mu X. c[X] \equiv c[\mu X. c[X]]$ of the modal $\mu$-calculus.
  We consider the modal $\mu$-calculus as overarching temporal logic and, as usual, reduce the problem whether $\varphi_1 \equiv \varphi_2$ holds for contextual formulas $\varphi_1, \varphi_2$ to the problem whether $\varphi_1 \leftrightarrow \varphi_2$ is valid . We show that the problem whether a contextual formula of the $\mu$-calculus is valid for all contexts can be reduced to validity of ordinary formulas. Our first result constructs a canonical context such that a formula is valid for all contexts if{}f it is valid for this particular one. However, the ordinary formula is exponential in the nesting-depth of the context variables. In a second result we solve this problem, thus proving that validity of contextual formulas is EXP-complete, as for ordinary equivalences. We also prove that both results hold for CTL and LTL as well. We conclude the paper with some experimental results. In particular, we use our implementation to automatically prove the correctness of a set of six contextual equivalences of LTL recently introduced by Esparza et al. for the normalization of LTL formulas. While Esparza et al. need several pages of manual proof, our tool only needs milliseconds to do the job and to compute counterexamples for incorrect variants of the equivalences.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations I: Directed complete posets and Scott's $D_\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop domain theory in constructive and predicative univalent foundations (also known as homotopy type theory). That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such as programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a careful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be carried out in a predicative setting. In particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations II: Continuous and algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <title>Locally tabular products of modal logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the product $L_1\times L_2$ of two Kripke complete consistent logics, local tabularity of $L_1$ and $L_2$ is necessary for local tabularity of $L_1\times L_2$. However, it is not sufficient: the product of two locally tabular logics can be not locally tabular. We provide extra semantic and axiomatic conditions which give criteria of local tabularity of the product of two locally tabular logics. Then we apply them to identify new families of locally tabular products.</description>
