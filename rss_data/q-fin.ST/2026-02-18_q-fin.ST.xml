      <title>Quantum Reservoir Computing for Statistical Classification in a Superconducting Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze numerically the performance of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) for statistical and financial problems. We use a reservoir composed of two superconducting islands coupled via their charge degrees of freedom. The key non-linear elements that provide the reservoir with rich and complex dynamics are the Josephson junctions that connect each island to the ground. We show that QRC implemented in this circuit can accurately classify complex probability distributions, including those with heavy tails, and identify regimes in correlated time series, such as periods of high volatility generated by standard econometric models. We find QRC to outperform some of the best classical methods when the amount of information is limited. This demonstrates its potential to be a noise-resilient quantum learning approach capable of tackling real-world problems within currently available superconducting platforms. We further discuss how to improve our QRC algorithm in real superconducting hardware to benefit from a much larger Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of SOFR term structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SOFR derivatives market remains illiquid and incomplete so it is not amenable to classical risk-neutral term structure models which are based on the assumption of perfect liquidity and completeness. This paper develops a statistical SOFR term structure model that is well-suited for risk management and derivatives pricing within the incomplete markets paradigm. The model incorporates relevant macroeconomic factors that drive central bank policy rates which, in turn, cause jumps often observed in the SOFR rates. The model is easy to calibrate to historical data, current market quotes, and the user's views concerning the future development of the relevant macroeconomic factors. The model is well suited for large-scale simulations often required in risk management, portfolio optimization and indifference pricing of interest rate derivatives.</description>
