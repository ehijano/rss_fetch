      <title>Device/circuit simulations of silicon spin qubits based on a gate-all-around transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the readout process of a spin--qubit structure based on a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor. Our study focuses on a logical qubit composed of two physical qubits. Different spin configurations result in different charge distributions, which subsequently influence the electrostatic effects on the GAA transistor. Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier.</description>

      <title>Field manipulation of Weyl modes in an ideal Dirac semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent Weyl modes with the broken time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry provide large Berry curvature and chirality to carriers, offering the realistic platforms to explore topology of electrons in three-dimensional systems. However, the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is of particular interest in the fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential application in spintronics, is scarcely achieved due to restriction of inborn symmetry in crystals. Here, by tuning the direction and strength of magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, we report the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode by the magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations. Specifically, under a magnetic field with broken mirror symmetry, anomalous Hall effect with step feature results from the large Berry curvature for the gapped Weyl mode. A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively. Our findings reveal distinct Weyl modes under the intertwined crystal symmetry and time-reversal breaking, laying the foundation of manipulating multiple Weyl modes in chiral spintronic network.</description>

      <title>An extended low-frequency noise compact model for single-layer graphene FETs including correlated mobility fluctuations effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated mobility fluctuations are considered in the physics-based carrier number fluctuation deltaN low-frequency noise (LFN) compact model of single-layer graphene field effect transistors (GFET) in the present study. Trapped charge density and Coulomb scattering coefficient deltaN LFN parameters are obtained after applying a parameter extraction methodology, adapted from conventional silicon technologies, to the linear ambipolar regions of GFETs. Appropriate adjustments are considered in the method according to GFETs physical characteristics. Afterwards, Hooge mobility as well as series resistance fluctuations LFN parameters can be extracted. The updated LFN model is validated with experimental data from various long and short-channel GFETs at an extended range of gate and drain bias conditions.</description>

      <title>Sub-diffraction-resolved spatial distribution of emitting excitons in STM-induced luminescence of 2D semiconductors via Richardson-Lucy deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using scanning tunneling microscopy-induced luminescence (STML), the optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors may be investigated at the nanoscale. This is possible because the tunneling current under the tip is an extremely localized electrical excitation source. However, in most STML applications, the spatial distribution of the emission relative to the excitation point is unresolved. Yet this distribution contains key information about how the interaction of excitons with injected charge carriers affects the luminescence of these materials, and about exciton transport. Resolving this spatial distribution at the nanoscale is relevant both for a fundamental understanding of exciton physics and for device applications; yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, we resolve the spatial distribution of the emission beyond the diffraction limit of light by deconvolving real-space optical microscopy images of the STML using an iterative algorithm, i.e., Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. To showcase this technique, we apply it to the STML of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\mathrm{WSe_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS_2}$). Thus, we highlight hitherto ignored or misunderstood aspects of STML on 2D semiconductors related to exciton and charge carrier transport, namely the dependence of the spatial distribution of emission on the tunnel current setpoint and the origin of the emission from hot spots located micrometers from the excitation source.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle X-ray Scattering Reveals a High Local Supersaturation of Precursors as the Origin of CoO Assembly Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-particle small-angle X-ray scattering (SP-SAXS) enables quantitative morphological analysis by recording diffraction snapshots from isolated particles using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses. Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, which average over the entire illuminated sample volume, SP-SAXS resolves low-contrast, less abundant, or transient species within heterogeneous particle populations that would otherwise remain hidden. Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic transport in ballistic bilayer graphene cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closing the gap between ray tracing simulations and experimentally observed electron jetting in bilayer graphene (BLG), we study all-electronic, gate-defined BLG cavities using tight-binding simulations and semiclassical equations of motion. Such cavities offer a rich playground to investigate anisotropic electron transport due to the trigonally warped Fermi surfaces. In this work, we achieve two things: First, we verify the existence of triangular modes (as predicted by classical ray tracing calculations) in the quantum solutions of closed circular BLG cavities. Then, we explore signatures of said triangular modes in transport through open BLG cavities connected to leads. We show that the triangular symmetry translates into anisotropic transport and present an optimal setup for experimental detection of the triangular modes as well as for controlled modulation of transport in preferred directions.</description>

      <title>Surface-modes mediated long-range radiative heat transfer through a plasmonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radiative heat transfer through a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of plasmonic InSb nanoparticles in close vicinity of an InSb substrate. We show how the frequency bands of the in- plane and out-of-plane modes in the chain are deformed by the coupling to the surface waves in the InSb substrate by considering different carrier concentrations. By calculating the Zak phase we show that also in the presence of the substrate there is a topological phase transition and that topologically protected edge modes emerge for finite chains. Finally, we demonstrate the long-range heat transport along the chain due to the coupling to the surface waves of the sample. We find an enhanced heat transfer in the topological non-trivial phase compared to the trivial phase due to the contribution of the edge modes.</description>

      <title>Non-linear transport in multifold semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport measurements are a powerful way to probe the electronic structure of quantum materials, but the information they contain is often convoluted. Yet, in particular for simple low-energy fermiologies, and by combining linear and non-linear responses, definite conclusion can be drawn -- such as, for instance, in the case of the circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. Here, we derive the complete DC intrinsic transport response functions up to third order in the applied electric field within Boltzmann theory that hold combined information about quantum geometry and band dispersion. We discuss the responses for multifold fermions at high-symmetry momenta in time-reversal symmetric crystals as well as their reduction by symmetry constraints. We exemplify in detail the cases of space group 213 and space group 199, which realize different multifold fermions, and show under which conditions these low-energy excitations can be differentially addressed through their bulk nonlinear responses, enabling nonlinear valley-tronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Driven Crystallization: A Neural-Network Variational Monte Carlo Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wigner crystals are a paradigmatic form of interaction driven electronic order. A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $\lambda$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors.</description>

      <title>Effect of superconductivity on non-uniform magnetization in dirty SF junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study proximity effect in a tunnel junction between a bulk superconductor and a thin disordered ferromagnetic layer on its surface. Cooper pairs penetrating from the superconductor into the ferromagnet tend to destabilize its uniform magnetic order. The competition of this effect and the intrinsic magnetic stiffness of the ferromagnet leads to a second order phase transition between uniform and non-uniform magnetic states. Using the quasiclassical Usadel equation, we derive the Landau functional for this transition and construct the complete phase diagram of the effect. We identify a special point of "resonance" at which the characteristic energy scale of the proximity effect equals the exchange field of the ferromagnet. At this point, the uniform magnetic state is unstable even in the limit of large stiffness. We further explore the parameter regime far beyond the transition and determine the properties of the resulting strongly non-uniform magnetic state.</description>

      <title>Coherent and compact van der Waals transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art superconducting qubits rely on a limited set of thin-film materials. Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Moire-Engineered Ferroelectric Transistors for Nearly Trap-free, Low-Power and Non-Volatile 2D Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range moire patterns in twisted WSe2 enable a built-in, moire-length-scale ferroelectric polarization that can be directly harnessed in electronic devices. Such a built-in ferroic landscape offers a compelling means to enable ultralow-voltage and non-volatile electronic functionality in two-dimensional materials; however, achieving stable polarization control without charge trapping has remained a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade). The device exhibits a stable non-volatile memory window of 0.10 V and high mobility, exceeding the performance of previously reported two-dimensional FeFET and matching that of advanced silicon-based devices. In addition, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy, corroborated by self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire modeling, indicates ultrafast ferroelectric switching (~0.5 microseconds). These results establish moire-engineered ferroelectricity as a practical and scalable route toward ultraclean, low-power, and non-volatile 2D electronics, bridging atomistic lattice engineering with functional device architectures for next-generation memory and logic technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Chiral Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-perturbative framework for quantizing chiral solitons in interacting quantum spin chains. This approach provides a direct lattice extension of the well-established $S$-duality between the sine-Gordon and Thirring models, thereby bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts. By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone. A key result is that the dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, $\operatorname{sgn}(t_{1+}) = (-1)^{2S+1}$, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains. We further identify characteristic signatures of these chiral excitations in the dynamical spin structure factor, demonstrating their visibility in inelastic neutron scattering. Our results open a route to experimentally probing non-perturbative features of dual quantum field theories in condensed-matter settings.</description>

      <title>Disorder-mediated linear and nonlinear magnetotransport in the charge-density-wave material ${\rm Ta_2NiSe_7 }$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report disorder-mediated first-order linear and higher-order nonlinear (magneto-)transport of Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ (TNS) in the charge-density-wave (CDW) regime. CDW transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and carrier density are proportional and inversely proportional to residual resistance ratio of samples, respectively. Such relation helps to understand the unique CDW order therein. High-$T_{CDW}$ TNS exhibits negative first-harmonic magnetoresistance (MR$^{1\omega}$) under a magnetic field ($B$) parallel to the direction of alternating current ($I^{\omega}$), which may arise from the anomalous velocity induced by the Berry curvature of three-dimensional topological bands near the Fermi level. As $T_{CDW}$ drops, a positive-to-negative MR$^{1\omega}$ transition is observed with decreasing perpendicular $B$, which is likely due to the contribution of Zeeman effect on current pathways in the disordered system. Moreover, interestingly, the second-harmonic nonlinear signals are suppressed, while the third-harmonic signals are significant and sensitive to both $B$ and $T_{CDW}$. Such observations, together with scaling analysis, suggest the quantum geometry quadrupole at play and the modulation of disorder on third-order nonlinearity. Our results pave an avenue for tailoring distinct-order magnetoresistive phases in disordered topological materials.</description>

      <title>Higher Josephson harmonics in a tunable double-junction transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable Josephson harmonics open up for new qubit design. We demonstrate a superconducting circuit element with a tunnel junction in series with a SQUID loop, yielding a highly magnetic-flux tunable harmonic content of the Josephson potential. We analyze spectroscopy of the first four qubit transitions with a circuit model which includes the internal mode, revealing a second harmonic up to $\sim10\%$ of the fundamental harmonic. Interestingly, a sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes is achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes. The highly tunable set-up provides a route toward protected qubits, and customizable nonlinear microwave devices.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signature of the Emerging Abrikosov Lattice Above $H_{c2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the Abrikosov lattice in the normal phase of type-II superconducting films when the magnetic field approaches the critical field $H_{c2}$ from above was predicted in Ref.~\cite{GVV2011}. In the quantum fluctuation regime \cite{GL2001} it is characterized by the formation of relatively large (with sizes of order $\xi_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \xi_{\mathrm{BCS}}\sqrt{H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})}$) ``long lived'' (lifetime of order $\tau_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \hbar \Delta^{-1} H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})$) clusters of rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs - signatures of developing Abrikosov vortices. We demonstrate that these fluctuation-induced vortex clusters, previously considered unobservable due to their ultrafast dynamics and weak (only logarithmically singular) contribution to the dc-conductivity, can in fact be detected through their distinct electromagnetic signature. By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations. This enhancement is expected to occur at characteristic frequencies $\omega_{QF} \sim \hbar^{-1}\Delta(H-H_{c2})/H_{c2}$, which are well below the superconducting threshold at $2\hbar^{-1}\Delta $, where a similar increase in imaginary conductivity occurs in the superconducting phase. For niobium, a prototypical type II superconductor, $\omega_{QF}$ lies in the experimentally accessible microwave range, making the effect directly testable with modern microwave spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Supersolidity at the Superfluid-Solid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolidity, combining superfluid and crystalline orders, has been realized in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates by tuning interatomic interactions. Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Bilayers Hybridized with Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanosheets for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have attracted attention as a promising and cost-effective alternative catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their aggregation and poor conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to improve the conductivity and density of electroactive edges of MoS2 through hybridization with akin advanced 2D materials. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are added to a liquid-phase-exfoliated MoS2 dispersion to create drop-casting hybrid MoS2@rGO electrodes for HER. The findings reveal the formation of ~1.1 nm-thick MoS2 bilayers, with the catalytic performance of MoS2@rGO dependent on the degree of graphene oxide reduction. The rGO moderate reduction prevents the MoS2 bilayers from restacking, improves conductivity, retains oxygenated groups that enhance interlayer spacing, and exposes more electroactive edges. When hybridized with rGO crafted at optimal reduction time, the hybrid system eclipses the efficiency of pristine MoS2 bilayers by attaining the lowest overpotential (~70 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (~46 mV dec-1). This shows that MoS2 bilayers hybridized with rGO offer a promising method to outperform the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2-based electrodes. These findings expand opportunities for future strain engineering, defect engineering, and high-end twist-angle assemblies for hybrid systems combining MoS2 bilayers and rGO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a driven-dissipative Floquet model in which a single harmonic oscillator with modulated frequency and decay realizes a non-Hermitian synthetic lattice with an effective electric field gradient in frequency space. Using the Floquet-Green's function and its doubled-space representation, we identify a topological regime that supports directional amplification and frequency conversion, accurately captured by a local winding number. The underlying mode structure is well described by a Jackiw-Rebbi-like continuum theory with Dirac cones and solitonic zero modes in synthetic frequency. Our results establish a simple and experimentally feasible route to non-Hermitian topological amplification, naturally implementable in current quantum technologies such as superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: Spin fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets in the presence of crystalline lattice dislocations are investigated. We show the existence of topologically protected non-propagative modes that localize at dislocations. These in-gap states, coined as {\it magnonic dislocation modes}, are characterized by the $Z_2$ topological invariant that derives from parity symmetry broken induced by sublattice magnetic anisotropy. We uncover that bulk topology existing in the perfect crystal is robust under the influence of lattice defects, which is monitored by the real-space Bott index. It is also revealed that the topology of {magnonic dislocation modes} remains unaffected when bulk topology becomes trivial and is remarkably resilient against magnetic disorder. Our findings point to the intriguing relationship between topological lattice defects and the spectrum of topological spin excitations.</description>

      <title>Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets: demon modes and Fano-demon states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets and apply it to describe their collective excitation spectrum. We predict that in addition to a conventional undamped plasmon mode, where both spin components oscillate in phase, there is an acoustic plasmon (or {\em demon}) mode with out-of-phase spin dynamics. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we reveal a strong dependence of the demon's frequency and spectral weight both on the Landau parameters and on the direction of propagation. Notably, as a function of the propagation angle, we show that the acoustic mode evolves from a {\em hidden state}, which has zero spectral weight in the density excitation spectrum, to a weakly damped propagating demon mode and then (below a critical interaction parameter) to a {\em Fano-demon mixed state}, which is marked by a strong hybridization with particle-hole excitations and a corresponding asymmetric line shape in the structure factor. Our Letter paves the way for applications of altermagnetic materials in optospintronics by harnessing collective electron spin oscillations beyond traditional magnon spin waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the closed-shell singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description>

      <title>A Functional Field Theorem: An Explicit Proof of Axioms and Equations for Applying iSAFT in Polymer Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.</description>

Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering processes, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, 2D materials pose a special challenge, as all 2D materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft x-ray ptychography is becoming a key synchrotron microscopy technique in the fields of condensed matter physics, chemistry, and environmental and life sciences. Its attractiveness across broad disciplinary fields is owed to the favorable combination of high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms. The SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) was developed to accommodate soft x-ray ptychography experiments requiring high spatial resolution, in addition to high chemical and ferroic sensitivities. An introduction to soft x-ray ptychography with SOPHIE aimed at prospective users is provided. Furthermore, an overview of the instrumentation of SOPHIE is given along with an example of the imaging capabilities, which demonstrate the achievement of a sub-10 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Superconductivity and Altermagnetism in Disordered Materials and Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$\pi$ transitions.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.</description>
