      <title>Relational Hoare Logic for High-Level Synthesis of Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a powerful tool for developing efficient hardware accelerators that rely on specialized memory systems to achieve sufficient on-chip data reuse and off-chip bandwidth utilization. However, even with HLS, designing such systems still requires careful manual tuning, as automatic optimizations provided by existing tools are highly sensitive to programming style and often lack transparency. To address these issues, we present a formal translation framework based on relational Hoare logic, which enables robust and transparent transformations. Our method recognizes complex memory access patterns in na\"ive HLS programs and automatically transforms them by inserting on-chip buffers to enforce linear access to off-chip memory, and by replacing non-sequential processing with stream processing, while preserving program semantics. Experiments using our prototype translator, combined with an off-the-shelf HLS compiler and a real FPGA board, have demonstrated significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>MLIR-Forge: A Modular Framework for Language Smiths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing compilers are essential for the efficient and correct execution of software across various scientific fields. Domain-specific languages (DSL) typically use higher level intermediate representations (IR) in their compiler pipelines for domain-specific optimizations. As these IRs add to complexity, it is crucial to test them thoroughly. Random program generators have proven to be an effective tool to test compilers through differential and fuzz testing. However, developing specialized program generators for compiler IRs is not straightforward and demands considerable resources. We introduce MLIR-Forge, a novel random program generator framework that leverages the flexibility of MLIR, aiming to simplify the creation of specialized program generators. MLIR-Forge achieves this by splitting the generation process into fundamental building blocks that are language specific, and reusable program creation logic that constructs random programs from these building blocks. This hides complexity and furthermore, even the language specific components can be defined using a set of common tools. We demonstrate MLIR-Forge's capabilities by generating MLIR with built-in dialects, WebAssembly, and a data-centric program representation, DaCe -- requiring less than a week of development time in total for each of them. Using the generated programs we conduct differential testing and find 9 MLIR, 15 WebAssembly, and 774 DaCe groups of bugs with the corresponding program generators, after running them until the rate of new bugs stagnates.</description>

      <title>Forward Symbolic Execution for Trustworthy Automation of Binary Code Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control flow in unstructured programs can be complex and dynamic, which makes static analysis difficult. Yet, automated reasoning about unstructured control flow is important when certifying properties of binary (machine) code in trustworthy systems, e.g., cryptographic routines. We present a theory of forward symbolic execution for unstructured programs suitable for use in theorem provers that enables automated verification of both functional and non-functional program properties. The theory's foundation is a set of inference rules where each member corresponds to an operation in a symbolic execution engine. The rules are designed to give control over the tradeoff between the preservation of precision and introduction of overapproximation. We instantiate our theory for BIR, a previously proposed intermediate language for binary analysis. We demonstrate how symbolic executors can be constructed for BIR with common optimizations such as pruning of infeasible symbolic states. We implemented our theory in the HOL4 theorem prover using the HolBA binary analysis library, obtaining machine-checked proofs of soundness of symbolic execution for BIR. We practically evaluated two applications of our theory: verification of functional properties of RISC-V binaries and verification of execution time bounds of programs running on the ARM Cortex-M0 processor. The evaluation shows that such verification can be automated with moderate overhead on medium-sized programs.</description>

      <title>Representing Molecules with Algebraic Data Types: Beyond SMILES and SELFIES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic data types (ADTs) let a representation specify at the type level what molecular values are valid and what transformations are meaningful. We propose a molecular representation as a family of typed ADTs that separates (i) constitution (Dietz style bonding systems), (ii) 3D coordinates and stereochemistry, and (iii) electronic structure annotations. This separation makes invariants explicit, supports deterministic local edits, and provides hooks for symmetry aware and Bayesian modeling. These data structures allow us to consider how the representation constrains operations which may be performed over them. Types make invalid manipulations unrepresentable and make it easier to define meaningful priors/likelihoods over generative models (programs with sample and score operations). Unlike string based formats, the ADT exposes chemical structure directly; validity conditions (e.g., valence and symmetry constraints) can be enforced by construction and checked deterministically during transformations. We optionally attach electronic structure annotations (shell/subshell/orbital metadata) to atoms when such information is available; we do not attempt to compute orbitals in this work. We sketch Bayesian probabilistic programming via an integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules can be made instances of a group under rotation to support geometric learning settings where molecular properties are invariant under rigid motions and relabellings; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to represent chemical reactions. We provide a Haskell library implementing the representation, released under an OSI approved open source license and archived with a DOI.</description>

      <title>CSSG: Measuring Code Similarity with Semantic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing code similarity metrics, such as BLEU, CodeBLEU, and TSED, largely rely on surface-level string overlap or abstract syntax tree structures, and often fail to capture deeper semantic relationships between programs.We propose CSSG (Code Similarity using Semantic Graphs), a novel metric that leverages program dependence graphs to explicitly model control dependencies and variable interactions, providing a semantics-aware representation of code.Experiments on the CodeContests+ dataset show that CSSG consistently outperforms existing metrics in distinguishing more similar code from less similar code under both monolingual and cross-lingual settings, demonstrating that dependency-aware graph representations offer a more effective alternative to surface-level or syntax-based similarity measures.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of AuDaLa: Turing Completeness and Possible Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14938v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AuDaLa is a recently introduced programming language that follows the new data autonomous paradigm. In this paradigm, small pieces of data execute functions autonomously. Considering the paradigm and the design choices of AuDaLa, it is interesting to determine the expressivity of the language. In this paper, we implement Turing machines in AuDaLa and prove that implementation correct. This proves that AuDaLa is Turing complete, giving an initial indication of AuDaLa's expressivity. Additionally, we give examples of how to add extensions to AuDaLa to increase its practical expressivity and to better match conventional parallel languages, allowing for a more straightforward and performant implementation of algorithms.</description>
