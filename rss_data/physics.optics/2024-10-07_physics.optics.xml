      <title>Cascaded-mode interferometers: spectral shape and linewidth engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometers are essential tools to measure and shape optical fields, and are widely used in optical metrology, sensing, laser physics, and quantum mechanics. They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, resulting in a change in light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay then allows to shape the spectrum of light, which is essential for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Simple Mach-Zehnder interferometers superimpose spatial waves and typically generate an output intensity that depends sinusoidally on frequency, limiting the capabilities for spectral engineering. Here, we present a novel framework that uses the interference of multiple transverse modes in a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Through the design of corrugated gratings, these modes couple to each other, allowing the exchange of energy similar to a beam splitter, facilitating easy handling of multiple modes. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate narrow-linewidth spectra with independently tunable free spectral range and linewidth, as well as independent spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our methodology can be applied to orthogonal optical modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, and holds promise for sensing, optical metrology, calibration, and computing.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary pulse-shaping in ultrashort pulse lasers using high-resolution direct phase control in the spectral domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser systems, those with a pulse duration on the order of picoseconds or less, have enabled advancements in a wide variety of fields. Of particular interest to this work, these laser systems are the key component to many High Energy Density (HED) physics experiments. Despite this, previous studies on the shape of the laser pulse within the HED community have focused primarily on pulse duration due to the relationship between pulse duration and peak intensity, while leaving the femtosecond scale structure of the pulse shape largely unstudied. To broaden the variety of potential pulses available for study, a method of reliably adjusting the pulse shape at the femtosecond scale using sub-nanometer resolution Direct Phase Control has been developed. This paper examines the capabilities of this new method compared to more commonplace dispersion-based pulse shaping methods. It also will detail the capabilities of the core algorithm driving this technique when used in conjunction with the WIZZLER and DAZZLER instruments that are common in high intensity laser labs. Finally, some discussion is given to possible applications on how the Direct Phase Control pulse shaping technique will be implemented in the future.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of a Low-cost Liquid Optical Waveguide for Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexities of fabrication techniques and the demand for high precision have posed significant challenges in the mass production of augmented reality (AR) waveguide combiners. Leveraging the capabilities of Polyjet 3D printing techniques, we have developed a cost-effective method for fabricating liquid geometric waveguide combiners for AR applications, using silicone oil as the medium. During the design phase, we optimized the structure of the waveguide combiner to facilitate easier fabrication. Our proposed method simplifies the production process by removing the need for complicated steps like dicing, layer bonding, and polishing, which are usually involved in traditional manufacturing techniques. We conducted optical simulations and developed a prototype using our patented fabrication method, which successfully demonstrated the integration of virtual images with the real-world environment, thereby confirming its feasibility and potential for cost-effective mass production.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of an attosecond pulse generation by a sub-cycle laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of sub-cycle driving fields on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), with a focus on intrinsic chirp, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and number of laser cycles. Our findings reveals that the center frequency of a laser pulse scales as $\tau^{-5/4}$ with pulse duration $\tau$, and that attochirp exhibits a similar dependence on pulse duration. Additionally, we identified CEP-specific trends in harmonic yield: it increases as $\tau^{5/4}$ for $\phi_0=0^\circ$ and decreases as $\tau^{-4.1}$ for $\phi_0= -90^\circ$. Although sub-cycle pulses can generate intense isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs), they also tend to produce higher attochirp and reduced cutoff energies. However, effective compensation for attochirp can mitigate these drawbacks, thereby increasing the capability of sub-cycle pulses to generate short-duration, high-intensity IAPs. These results offer valuable insights into HHG using sub-cycle pulses and have important implications for the advancement of ultrafast light sources and the understanding of ultrafast phenomena at the attosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>The Taiji microresonator as an unidirectional spiking neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While biological neurons ensure unidirectional signalling, scalable integrated photonic neurons, such as silicon microresonators, respond the same way regardless of excitation direction due to the Lorentz reciprocity principle. Here, we show that a non-linear Taiji microresonator is a proper optical analogous of a biological neuron showing both a spiking response as well as a direction dependence response.</description>

      <title>Compact laser-driven plasma X-ray source for time-resolved diffraction, spectroscopy, and imaging experiments at ELI Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentally measured characteristics of a kHz laser-driven Cu plasma X-ray source that was recently commissioned at ELI Beamlines facility are reported. The source can be driven either by an in-house developed high contrast sub-20 fs near-infrared TW laser based on optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification technology, or by a more conventional Ti:sapphire laser delivering 12 mJ, 45 fs pulses. The X-ray source parameters obtained with the two driving lasers are compared. Measured photon flux of the order up to 10^{12} K{\alpha} photons/4{\pi}/s is reported. Furthermore, experimental platforms for ultrafast X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption and/or emission spectroscopy based on the reported source are described.</description>

      <title>Point-Spread-Function Engineering in MINFLUX: Optimality of Donut and Half-Moon Excitation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization microscopy enables imaging with resolutions that surpass the conventional optical diffraction limit. Notably, the MINFLUX method achieves super-resolution by shaping the excitation point-spread function (PSF) to minimize the required photon flux for a given precision. Various beam shapes have recently been proposed to improve localization efficiency, yet their optimality remains an open question. In this work, we deploy a numerical and theoretical framework to determine optimal excitation patterns for MINFLUX. Such a computational approach allows us to search for new beam patterns in a fast and low-cost fashion, and to avoid time-consuming and expensive experimental explorations. We show that the conventional donut beam is a robust optimum when the excitation beams are all constrained to the same shape. Further, our PSF engineering framework yields two pairs of half-moon beams (orthogonal to each other) which can improve the theoretical localization precision by a factor of about two.</description>

      <title>A tuneable frequency comb via dual-beam laser-solid harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-power laser pulse at normal incidence onto a plane solid target will generate odd harmonics of its frequency. However, the spacing of the harmonic lines in this configuration is fixed. Here, we study harmonic generation using two laser beams incident on a plane target at small, opposite angles to the target normal, via particle-in-cell simulations. When looking at the harmonic radiation in a specific direction via a narrow slit or pinhole, we select an angle-dependent subset of the harmonic spectrum. This way, we obtain a harmonic frequency comb that we control via the observation angle and the input laser frequency. The divergence of the harmonic radiation will be reduced by using wider laser spots, thus increasing the efficacy of the scheme. We will discuss extensions to this scheme, such as using beams with unequal frequencies, a slight tilt of the target, or employing more than two beams.</description>

      <title>Physically Agnostic Quasinormal Mode Expansion in Time Dispersive Structures:from Mechanical Vibrations to Nanophotonic Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances, also known as quasi normal modes (QNM) in the non-Hermitian case, play an ubiquitous role in all domains of physics ruled by wave phenomena, notably in continuum mechanics, acoustics, electrodynamics, and quantum theory. In this paper, we present a QNM expansion for dispersive systems, recently applied to photonics but based on sixty year old techniques in mechanics. The resulting numerical algorithm appears to be physically agnostic, that is independent of the considered physical problem and can therefore be implemented as a mere toolbox in a nonlinear eigenvalue computation library.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer between Dissimilar Dielectric Media by Coupling Surface Phonon Polaritons to Graphenes Plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric media are very promising for near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) applications as these materials can thermally emit surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) resulting in large and quasi-monochromatic heat fluxes. Near-field radiative heat flux between dissimilar dielectric media is much smaller than that between similar dielectric media and is also not quasi-monochromatic. This is due to the mismatch of the SPhP frequencies of the two heat-exchanging dielectric media. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that NFRHT between dissimilar dielectric media increases substantially when a graphene sheet is deposited on the medium with the smaller SPhP frequency. An enhancement of 2.7 to 3.2 folds is measured for the heat flux between SiC and LiF separated by a vacuum gap of size 100 to 140 nm when LiF is covered by a graphene sheet. This enhancement is due to the coupling of SPhPs and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The SPPs of graphene are coupled to the SPhPs of LiF resulting in coupled SPhP-SPPs with a dispersion branch monotonically increasing with the wavevector. This monotonically increasing branch of dispersion relation intersects the dispersion branch of the SPhPs of SiC causing the coupling of the surface modes across the vacuum gap, which resonantly increases the heat flux at the SPhP frequency of SiC. This surface phonon-plasmon coupling also makes NFRHT quasi-monochromatic, which is highly desired for applications such as near-field thermophotovoltaics and thermophotonics. This study experimentally demonstrates that graphene is a very promising material for tuning the magnitude and spectrum of NFRHT between dissimilar dielectric media.</description>

      <title>Atom Camera: Super-resolution scanning microscope of a light pattern with a single ultracold atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-micrometer scale light patterns play a pivotal role in various fields, including biology, biophysics, and AMO physics. High-resolution, in situ observation of light profiles is essential for their design and application. However, current methods are constrained by limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, no existing techniques allow for super-resolution imaging of the polarization profile, which is critical for precise control of atomic and molecular quantum states. Here, we present an atom camera technique for in situ imaging of light patterns with a single ultracold atom held by an optical tweezers as a probe. By scanning the atom's position in steps of sub-micrometers and detecting the energy shift on the spin states, we reconstruct high-resolution 2D images of the light field. Leveraging the extraordinarily long coherence time and polarization-sensitive transitions in the spin structure of the atom, we achieve highly sensitive imaging both for intensity and polarization. We demonstrate this technique by characterizing the polarization in a tightly-focused beam, observing its unique non-trivial profile for the first time. The spatial resolution is limited only by the uncertainty of the atom's position, which we suppress down to the level of quantum fluctuations (~25 nm) in the tweezers' ground state. We thus obtain far better resolution than the optical diffraction limit, as well as than the previous ones obtained with a thermal atom fluctuating in the trap. This method enables the analysis and design of submicron-scale light patterns, providing a powerful tool for applications requiring precise light manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering problems are the classical tools for modeling of light-matter interaction. In this paper, we investigate the solution of dipole scattering problem under different incident radiation. In particular, we compare the two cases of incident plane and spherically incoming fields. With this comparison, we disclose the two distinct groups of current-sourced and current-free scattered fields which exhibit independent dynamics and dissimilar effects of the scatterer. We demonstrate how these fields by interfering each other make the resultant electric dipole moment of the scattered fields resonant and, thus, give rise to all the spectral features observed in the classical solution for dipole scattering of light.</description>

      <title>A fixed phase tunable directional coupler based on coupling tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of photonic integrated circuits has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a growing demand for devices that offer high-performance reconfigurability. Due to the inability of conventional tunable directional couplers (TDCs) to maintain a fixed phase while tuning the reflectivity, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are employed as the primary building blocks for reflectivity tuning in constructing large-scale circuits. However, MZIs are prone to fabrication errors due to the need for perfect balanced directional couplers to achieve 0-1 reflectivity, which hinders their scalability. In this study, we introduce a design of a TDC based on coupling constant tuning in the thin film Lithium Niobate platform and present an optimized design. Our optimized TDC design enables arbitrary reflectivity tuning while ensuring a consistent phase across a wide range of operating wavelengths. Furthermore, it exhibits fewer bending sections than MZIs and is inherently resilient to fabrication errors in waveguide geometry and coupling length compared to both MZIs and conventional TDCs. Our work contributes to developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits with implications for various fields, including optical communication systems and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a new regime of the formation of ultrashort optical solitons in spherical silica microresonators with whispering gallery modes.The solitons are driven by a coherent CW pump at the frequency in the range of normal dispersion, and the energy is transferred from this pump to the solitons via two channels: Raman amplification and the inverse Cherenkov effect. We discuss three different regimes of soliton propagation and we also show that these Raman solitons can be controlled by weak coherent CW signals.</description>

Abstract: Metasurfaces, consisting of large arrays of interacting subwavelength scatterers, pose significant challenges for general-purpose computational methods due to their large electric dimensions and multiscale nature. This paper introduces an efficient boundary element method specifically tailored for metasurfaces, leveraging the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation. Our method combines the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) with a representation of the unknown equivalent surface current density by means of static modes, a set of entire domain basis functions dependent only on object shape but independent of the material and frequency. The compression of the number of unknowns enabled by the Static Mode Representation (SMR), combined with the \(\mathcal{O}(N \log N)\) complexity of MLFMA matrix-vector products, significantly reduces CPU time and memory requirements compared to classical MLFMA with RWG basis functions. We demonstrate the accuracy, time, and memory requirements of this method through several test cases including the full-wave simulation of a $100 \lambda \times 100 \lambda$ canonical metalens. The MLFMA-SMR method offers substantial benefits for the analysis and optimization of metasurfaces and metalenses.</description>
