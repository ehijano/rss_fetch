      <title>How to introduce an initial crack in phase field simulations to accurately predict the linear elastic fracture propagation threshold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational phase field fracture models are now widely used to simulate crack propagation in structures. A critical aspect of these simulations is the correct determination of the propagation threshold of pre-existing cracks, as it highly relies on how the initial cracks are implemented. While prior studies briefly discuss initial crack implementation techniques, we present here a systematic investigation. Various techniques to introduce initial cracks in phase field fracture simulations are tested, from the crack explicit meshing to the replacement by a fully damaged phase field, including different variants for the boundary conditions. Our focus here is on phase field models aiming to approximate, in the $\Gamma$-convergence limit, Griffith quasi-static propagation in the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics. Therefore, a sharp crack model from classic linear elastic fracture mechanics based on Griffith criterion is the reference in this work. To assess the different techniques to introduce initial cracks, we rely on path-following methods to compute the sharp crack and the phase field smeared crack solutions. The underlying idea is that path-following ensures staying at equilibrium at each instant so that any difference between phase field and sharp crack models can be attributed to numerical artifacts. Thus, by comparing the results from both models, we can provide practical recommendations for reliably incorporating initial cracks in phase field fracture simulations. The comparison shows that an improper initial crack implementation often requires the smeared crack to transition to a one-element-wide phase band to adequately represent a displacement jump along a crack. This transition increases the energy required to propagate the crack, leading to a significant overshoot in the force-displacement response. The take-home message is that to predict the propagation threshold accurately and avoid artificial toughening; the crack must be initialized either setting the phase field to its damage state over a one-element-wide band or meshing the crack explicitly as a one-element-wide slit and imposing the fully cracked state on the crack surface.</description>

      <title>Thermal Model Calibration of a Squirrel-Cage Induction Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient thermal simulations of induction machines are indispensable for detecting thermal hot spots and hence avoiding potential material failure in an early design stage. A goal is the better utilization of the machines with reduced safety margins due to a better knowledge of the critical conditions. In this work, the parameters of a two-dimensional induction machine model are calibrated according to evidence from measurements, by solving an inverse field problem. The set of parameters comprise material parameters as well as parameters that model three-dimensional effects. This allows a consideration of physical effects without explicit knowledge of its quantities. First, the accuracy of the approach is studied using an academic example in combination with synthetic data. Afterwards, it is successfully applied to a realistic induction machine model.</description>

      <title>From In Silico to In Vitro: A Comprehensive Guide to Validating Bioinformatics Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of bioinformatics predictions and experimental validation plays a pivotal role in advancing biological research, from understanding molecular mechanisms to developing therapeutic strategies. Bioinformatics tools and methods offer powerful means for predicting gene functions, protein interactions, and regulatory networks, but these predictions must be validated through experimental approaches to ensure their biological relevance. This review explores the various methods and technologies used for experimental validation, including gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction verification, and pathway validation. We also discuss the challenges involved in translating computational predictions to experimental settings and highlight the importance of collaboration between bioinformatics and experimental research. Finally, emerging technologies, such as CRISPR gene editing, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence, are shaping the future of bioinformatics validation and driving more accurate and efficient biological discoveries.</description>

      <title>Logic-Q: Improving Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading via Program Sketch-based Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionized quantitative trading (Q-trading) by achieving decent performance without significant human expert knowledge. Despite its achievements, we observe that the current state-of-the-art DRL models are still ineffective in identifying the market trends, causing them to miss good trading opportunities or suffer from large drawdowns when encountering market crashes. To address this limitation, a natural approach is to incorporate human expert knowledge in identifying market trends. Whereas, such knowledge is abstract and hard to be quantified. In order to effectively leverage abstract human expert knowledge, in this paper, we propose a universal logic-guided deep reinforcement learning framework for Q-trading, called Logic-Q. In particular, Logic-Q adopts the program synthesis by sketching paradigm and introduces a logic-guided model design that leverages a lightweight, plug-and-play market trend-aware program sketch to determine the market trend and correspondingly adjusts the DRL policy in a post-hoc manner. Extensive evaluations of two popular quantitative trading tasks demonstrate that Logic-Q can significantly improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art DRL trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Audio-visual cross-modality knowledge transfer for machine learning-based in-situ monitoring in laser additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect anomalies and defects in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) processes. While multimodal fusion, which integrates data from visual, audio, and other modalities, can improve monitoring performance, it also increases hardware, computational, and operational costs. This paper introduces a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology for LAM in-situ monitoring, which transfers knowledge from a source modality to a target modality. CMKT enhances the representativeness of the features extracted from the target modality, allowing the removal of source modality sensors during prediction. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. The semantic alignment method establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It employs a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of identical groups (e.g., visual and audio defective groups) and a separation loss to distinguish different groups (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free groups). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving features from one modality to another using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches. In a case study for LAM in-situ defect detection, the proposed CMKT methods were compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion. The semantic alignment method achieved an accuracy of 98.6% while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the 98.2% accuracy obtained through multimodal fusion. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we discovered that semantic alignment CMKT can extract more representative features while reducing noise by leveraging the inherent correlations between modalities.</description>
