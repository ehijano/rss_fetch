      <title>The trouble with deautonomising higher order maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deautonomisation of birational maps that have the singularity confinement property, i.e. the construction of nonautonomous versions of such maps that preserve the singularity properties of the original, has proven crucial in our understanding of the mathematical properties behind the integrability of second order maps. For example, the deautonomisation procedure led directly to the development of a general theory of discrete Painlev\'e equations, and it seems highly likely it will play a crucial role in any future theory of higher dimensional Painlev\'e equations as well. Generally speaking however, higher order integrable mappings may have non-confined singularities and it is important to understand if, and how, deautonomisation should work for such mappings. In this paper we explore different deautonomisation scenarios on a series of carefully constructed higher order mappings, integrable as well as non-integrable, that possess non-confined singularities and we challenge some common assumptions regarding the co-dimensionality of the singular loci that might play a role in the deautonomisation process. Along the way we also propose a novel procedure to calculate the growth of the multiplicities of singularities that appear in so-called anticonfined singularity patterns, based on an ultradiscrete version of the mapping.</description>

      <title>Painleve solitons of AKNS system and irrational algebraic solitons of NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painleve solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painleve solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painleve transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a different symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painleve IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painleve IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum theory for accessing nonlinear systems: the case of Levinson-Smith equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently developed generalized scheme of quantum mechanics, we touch upon connections with Levinson-Smith classes of nonlinear systems that contain as a particular case the Li\'{e}nard family of differential equations. The latter, which has coefficients of odd and odd symmetry, admits a closed form solution when converted to the Abel form. Analysis of the governing condition shows that one of the nontrivial equilibrium points is stable in character. Other classes of differential equations that we encounter speak of solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions for a certain combination of underlying parameters, while, for a different set, relevance to position-dependent mass systems is shown. In addition, an interesting off-shoot of our results is the emergence of solitonic-like solutions from the condition of the level surface in the system.</description>

      <title>Integrable Zhaidary equations: reductions and gauge equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02073v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work addresses the study and characterization of the integrability of some generalized spin systems (ISS) in 1+1 dimensions. Lax representations for these ISS are successfully obtained. The gauge equivalent counterparts of these integrable ISS are presented. Finally, we consider Zhanbota transcendents and some integrable Zhanbota equations. In particular, the gauge equivalence between some Zhanbota equations and the six Painleve equations is established.</description>

      <title>Localized excitation on the Jacobi elliptic periodic background for the (n+1)-dimensional generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the linear spectral problem, which associated with the (n+1)-dimensional generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (gKP) equation, with the Jacobi elliptic function as the external potential is investigated based on the Lam\'{e} function, from which some novel local nonlinear wave solutions on the Jacobi elliptic function have been obtained by Darboux transformation, and the corresponding dynamics have also been discussed. The degenerate solutions of the nonlinear wave solutions on the Jacobi function background for the gKP equation are constructed by taking the modulus of the Jacobi function to be 0 and 1. The findings indicate that there can be various types of nonlinear wave solutions with different ranges of spectral parameters, including soliton and breather waves. Furthermore, the interplay between nonlinearity and dispersion is found to have observable effects on the propagation dynamics of breather waves. These results will be useful for elucidating and predicting nonlinear phenomena in related physical fields, such as fluid mechanics and physical ocean.</description>
