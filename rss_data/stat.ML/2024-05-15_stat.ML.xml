      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? We consider learning period three with random neural networks and report the universal property associated with it. We first show that the trained networks have a thermodynamic limit that depends on the choice of target data and network settings. Our analysis reveals that almost all learned periods are unstable and each network has its characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). Here, we propose the concept of characteristic bifurcation expressing embeddable attractors intrinsic to the network, in which the target data points and the scale of the network weights function as bifurcation parameters. In conclusion, learning period three generates various attractors through characteristic bifurcation due to the stability change in latently existing numerous unstable periods of the system.</description>

      <title>A distribution-free valid p-value for finite samples of bounded random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a valid p-value based on a concentration inequality for bounded random variables introduced by Pelekis, Ramon and Wang. The motivation behind this work is the calibration of predictive algorithms in a distribution-free setting. The super-uniform p-value is tighter than Hoeffding and Bentkus alternatives in certain regions. Even though we are motivated by a calibration setting in a machine learning context, the ideas presented in this work are also relevant in classical statistical inference. Furthermore, we compare the power of a collection of valid p- values for bounded losses, which are presented in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Robust Approximate Sampling via Stochastic Gradient Barker Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient (SG) Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) are popular algorithms for Bayesian sampling in the presence of large datasets. However, they come with little theoretical guarantees and assessing their empirical performances is non-trivial. In such context, it is crucial to develop algorithms that are robust to the choice of hyperparameters and to gradients heterogeneity since, in practice, both the choice of step-size and behaviour of target gradients induce hard-to-control biases in the invariant distribution. In this work we introduce the stochastic gradient Barker dynamics (SGBD) algorithm, extending the recently developed Barker MCMC scheme, a robust alternative to Langevin-based sampling algorithms, to the stochastic gradient framework. We characterize the impact of stochastic gradients on the Barker transition mechanism and develop a bias-corrected version that, under suitable assumptions, eliminates the error due to the gradient noise in the proposal. We illustrate the performance on a number of high-dimensional examples, showing that SGBD is more robust to hyperparameter tuning and to irregular behavior of the target gradients compared to the popular stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Saturation Effect of Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturation effect refers to the phenomenon that the kernel ridge regression (KRR) fails to achieve the information theoretical lower bound when the smoothness of the underground truth function exceeds certain level. The saturation effect has been widely observed in practices and a saturation lower bound of KRR has been conjectured for decades. In this paper, we provide a proof of this long-standing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Constrained Learning for Causal Inference and Semiparametric Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal estimation (e.g. of the average treatment effect) requires estimating complex nuisance parameters (e.g. outcome models). To adjust for errors in nuisance parameter estimation, we present a novel correction method that solves for the best plug-in estimator under the constraint that the first-order error of the estimator with respect to the nuisance parameter estimate is zero. Our constrained learning framework provides a unifying perspective to prominent first-order correction approaches including debiasing (a.k.a. augmented inverse probability weighting) and targeting (a.k.a. targeted maximum likelihood estimation). Our semiparametric inference approach, which we call the "C-Learner", can be implemented with modern machine learning methods such as neural networks and tree ensembles, and enjoys standard guarantees like semiparametric efficiency and double robustness. Empirically, we demonstrate our approach on several datasets, including those with text features that require fine-tuning language models. We observe the C-Learner matches or outperforms other asymptotically optimal estimators, with better performance in settings with less estimated overlap.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds for Causal Regression: Insights, Guarantees and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many algorithms have been recently proposed for causal machine learning. Yet, there is little to no theory on their quality, especially considering finite samples. In this work, we propose a theory based on generalization bounds that provides such guarantees. By introducing a novel change-of-measure inequality, we are able to tightly bound the model loss in terms of the deviation of the treatment propensities over the population, which we show can be empirically limited. Our theory is fully rigorous and holds even in the face of hidden confounding and violations of positivity. We demonstrate our bounds on semi-synthetic and real data, showcasing their remarkable tightness and practical utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that randomly initialized, push-forward, fully-connected neural networks weakly converge to isotropic Gaussian processes, in the limit where the width of all layers goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to use the angular power spectrum of the limiting field to characterize the complexity of the network architecture. In particular, we define sequences of random variables associated with the angular power spectrum, and provide a full characterization of the network complexity in terms of the asymptotic distribution of these sequences as the depth diverges. On this basis, we classify neural networks as low-disorder, sparse, or high-disorder; we show how this classification highlights a number of distinct features for standard activation functions, and in particular, sparsity properties of ReLU networks. Our theoretical results are also validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls and Promise of Conformal Inference Under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical applications such as medical imaging and autonomous driving, where decisions have profound implications for patient health and road safety, it is imperative to maintain both high adversarial robustness to protect against potential adversarial attacks and reliable uncertainty quantification in decision-making. With extensive research focused on enhancing adversarial robustness through various forms of adversarial training (AT), a notable knowledge gap remains concerning the uncertainty inherent in adversarially trained models. To address this gap, this study investigates the uncertainty of deep learning models by examining the performance of conformal prediction (CP) in the context of standard adversarial attacks within the adversarial defense community. It is first unveiled that existing CP methods do not produce informative prediction sets under the commonly used $l_{\infty}$-norm bounded attack if the model is not adversarially trained, which underpins the importance of adversarial training for CP. Our paper next demonstrates that the prediction set size (PSS) of CP using adversarially trained models with AT variants is often worse than using standard AT, inspiring us to research into CP-efficient AT for improved PSS. We propose to optimize a Beta-weighting loss with an entropy minimization regularizer during AT to improve CP-efficiency, where the Beta-weighting loss is shown to be an upper bound of PSS at the population level by our theoretical analysis. Moreover, our empirical study on four image classification datasets across three popular AT baselines validates the effectiveness of the proposed Uncertainty-Reducing AT (AT-UR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Machine Learning (ML) models are referred to as black box models, providing no real insights into why a prediction is made. Feature importance and explainability are important for increasing transparency and trust in ML models, particularly in settings such as healthcare and finance. With quantum computing's unique capabilities, such as leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition, which can be combined with ML techniques to create the field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and such techniques may be applied to QML models. This article explores feature importance and explainability insights in QML compared to Classical ML models. Utilizing the widely recognized Iris dataset, classical ML algorithms such as SVM and Random Forests, are compared against hybrid quantum counterparts, implemented via IBM's Qiskit platform: the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC). This article aims to provide a comparison of the insights generated in ML by employing permutation and leave one out feature importance methods, alongside ALE (Accumulated Local Effects) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainers.</description>

      <title>Neural Collapse Meets Differential Privacy: Curious Behaviors of NoisyGD with Near-perfect Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study by De et al. (2022) has reported that large-scale representation learning through pre-training on a public dataset significantly enhances differentially private (DP) learning in downstream tasks, despite the high dimensionality of the feature space. To theoretically explain this phenomenon, we consider the setting of a layer-peeled model in representation learning, which results in interesting phenomena related to learned features in deep learning and transfer learning, known as Neural Collapse (NC).
  Within the framework of NC, we establish an error bound indicating that the misclassification error is independent of dimension when the distance between actual features and the ideal ones is smaller than a threshold. Additionally, the quality of the features in the last layer is empirically evaluated under different pre-trained models within the framework of NC, showing that a more powerful transformer leads to a better feature representation. Furthermore, we reveal that DP fine-tuning is less robust compared to fine-tuning without DP, particularly in the presence of perturbations. These observations are supported by both theoretical analyses and experimental evaluation. Moreover, to enhance the robustness of DP fine-tuning, we suggest several strategies, such as feature normalization or employing dimension reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Empirically, we demonstrate a significant improvement in testing accuracy by conducting PCA on the last-layer features.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems and complex networks: A Koopman operator perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has entered and transformed many research areas over the last years. Although the underlying concept$\unicode{x2013}$representing highly nonlinear dynamical systems by infinite-dimensional linear operators$\unicode{x2013}$has been known for a long time, the availability of large data sets and efficient machine learning algorithms for estimating the Koopman operator from data make this framework extremely powerful and popular. Koopman operator theory allows us to gain insights into the characteristic global properties of a system without requiring detailed mathematical models. We will show how these methods can also be used to analyze complex networks and highlight relationships between Koopman operators and graph Laplacians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kalman filtering and smoothing are the foundational mechanisms for efficient inference in Gauss-Markov models. However, their time and memory complexities scale prohibitively with the size of the state space. This is particularly problematic in spatiotemporal regression problems, where the state dimension scales with the number of spatial observations. Existing approximate frameworks leverage low-rank approximations of the covariance matrix. Since they do not model the error introduced by the computational approximation, their predictive uncertainty estimates can be overly optimistic. In this work, we propose a probabilistic numerical method for inference in high-dimensional Gauss-Markov models which mitigates these scaling issues. Our matrix-free iterative algorithm leverages GPU acceleration and crucially enables a tunable trade-off between computational cost and predictive uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method on a large-scale climate dataset.</description>

      <title>An adaptive approach to Bayesian Optimization with switching costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate modifications to Bayesian Optimization for a resource-constrained setting of sequential experimental design where changes to certain design variables of the search space incur a switching cost. This models the scenario where there is a trade-off between evaluating more while maintaining the same setup, or switching and restricting the number of possible evaluations due to the incurred cost. We adapt two process-constrained batch algorithms to this sequential problem formulation, and propose two new methods: one cost-aware and one cost-ignorant. We validate and compare the algorithms using a set of 7 scalable test functions in different dimensionalities and switching-cost settings for 30 total configurations. Our proposed cost-aware hyperparameter-free algorithm yields comparable results to tuned process-constrained algorithms in all settings we considered, suggesting some degree of robustness to varying landscape features and cost trade-offs. This method starts to outperform the other algorithms with increasing switching-cost. Our work broadens out from other recent Bayesian Optimization studies in resource-constrained settings that consider a batch setting only. While the contributions of this work are relevant to the general class of resource-constrained problems, they are particularly relevant to problems where adaptability to varying resource availability is of high importance</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Conformal Inference Under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have experienced increasing utilization of complex machine learning models across multiple sources of data to inform more generalizable decision-making. However, distribution shifts across data sources and privacy concerns related to sharing individual-level data, coupled with a lack of uncertainty quantification from machine learning predictions, make it challenging to achieve valid inferences in multi-source environments. In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining distribution-free prediction intervals for a target population, leveraging multiple potentially biased data sources. We derive the efficient influence functions for the quantiles of unobserved outcomes in the target and source populations, and show that one can incorporate machine learning prediction algorithms in the estimation of nuisance functions while still achieving parametric rates of convergence to nominal coverage probabilities. Moreover, when conditional outcome invariance is violated, we propose a data-adaptive strategy to upweight informative data sources for efficiency gain and downweight non-informative data sources for bias reduction. We highlight the robustness and efficiency of our proposals for a variety of conformal scores and data-generating mechanisms via extensive synthetic experiments. Hospital length of stay prediction intervals for pediatric patients undergoing a high-risk cardiac surgical procedure between 2016-2022 in the U.S. illustrate the utility of our methodology.</description>

      <title>The Unfairness of $\varepsilon$-Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in decision-making processes is often quantified using probabilistic metrics. However, these metrics may not fully capture the real-world consequences of unfairness. In this article, we adopt a utility-based approach to more accurately measure the real-world impacts of decision-making process. In particular, we show that if the concept of $\varepsilon$-fairness is employed, it can possibly lead to outcomes that are maximally unfair in the real-world context. Additionally, we address the common issue of unavailable data on false negatives by proposing a reduced setting that still captures essential fairness considerations. We illustrate our findings with two real-world examples: college admissions and credit risk assessment. Our analysis reveals that while traditional probability-based evaluations might suggest fairness, a utility-based approach uncovers the necessary actions to truly achieve equality. For instance, in the college admission case, we find that enhancing completion rates is crucial for ensuring fairness. Summarizing, this paper highlights the importance of considering the real-world context when evaluating fairness.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Boosting: A General Framework with Applications to Posterior Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient boosting is a sequential ensemble method that fits a new base learner to the gradient of the remaining loss at each step. We propose a novel family of gradient boosting, Wasserstein gradient boosting, which fits a new base learner to an exactly or approximately available Wasserstein gradient of a loss functional on the space of probability distributions. Wasserstein gradient boosting returns a set of particles that approximates a target probability distribution assigned at each input. In probabilistic prediction, a parametric probability distribution is often specified on the space of output variables, and a point estimate of the output-distribution parameter is produced for each input by a model. Our main application of Wasserstein gradient boosting is a novel distributional estimate of the output-distribution parameter, which approximates the posterior distribution over the output-distribution parameter determined pointwise at each data point. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of the probabilistic prediction by Wasserstein gradient boosting in comparison with various existing methods.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that over-parameterized neural networks can achieve minimax optimal rates of convergence (up to logarithmic factors) for learning functions from certain smooth function classes, if the weights are suitably constrained or regularized. Specifically, we consider the nonparametric regression of estimating an unknown $d$-variate function by using shallow ReLU neural networks. It is assumed that the regression function is from the H\"older space with smoothness $\alpha&lt;(d+3)/2$ or a variation space corresponding to shallow neural networks, which can be viewed as an infinitely wide neural network. In this setting, we prove that least squares estimators based on shallow neural networks with certain norm constraints on the weights are minimax optimal, if the network width is sufficiently large. As a byproduct, we derive a new size-independent bound for the local Rademacher complexity of shallow ReLU neural networks, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stationarity without mean reversion in improper Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of a GP regression depends on the choice of covariance function. Stationary covariance functions are preferred in machine learning applications. However, (non-periodic) stationary covariance functions are always mean reverting and can therefore exhibit pathological behavior when applied to data that does not relax to a fixed global mean value. In this paper we show that it is possible to use improper GP priors with infinite variance to define processes that are stationary but not mean reverting. To this aim, we use of non-positive kernels that can only be defined in this limit regime. The resulting posterior distributions can be computed analytically and it involves a simple correction of the usual formulas. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a large family of smooth non-reverting covariance functions that closely resemble the kernels commonly used in the GP literature (e.g. squared exponential and Mat\'ern class). By analyzing both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that these non-positive kernels solve some known pathologies of mean reverting GP regression while retaining most of the favorable properties of ordinary smooth stationary kernels.</description>

      <title>Sliced-Wasserstein Estimation with Spherical Harmonics as Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance between probability measures is defined as the average of the Wasserstein distances resulting for the associated one-dimensional projections. As a consequence, the SW distance can be written as an integral with respect to the uniform measure on the sphere and the Monte Carlo framework can be employed for calculating the SW distance. Spherical harmonics are polynomials on the sphere that form an orthonormal basis of the set of square-integrable functions on the sphere. Putting these two facts together, a new Monte Carlo method, hereby referred to as Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV), is proposed for approximating the SW distance using spherical harmonics as control variates. The resulting approach is shown to have good theoretical properties, e.g., a no-error property for Gaussian measures under a certain form of linear dependency between the variables. Moreover, an improved rate of convergence, compared to Monte Carlo, is established for general measures. The convergence analysis relies on the Lipschitz property associated to the SW integrand. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SHCV against state-of-the-art methods for SW distance computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new conformal method for generating simultaneous forecasting bands guaranteed to cover the entire path of a new random trajectory with sufficiently high probability. Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Clustering with Bandit Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of online clustering with bandit feedback. A set of arms (or items) can be partitioned into various groups that are unknown. Within each group, the observations associated to each of the arms follow the same distribution with the same mean vector. At each time step, the agent queries or pulls an arm and obtains an independent observation from the distribution it is associated to. Subsequent pulls depend on previous ones as well as the previously obtained samples. The agent's task is to uncover the underlying partition of the arms with the least number of arm pulls and with a probability of error not exceeding a prescribed constant $\delta$. The problem proposed finds numerous applications from clustering of variants of viruses to online market segmentation. We present an instance-dependent information-theoretic lower bound on the expected sample complexity for this task, and design a computationally efficient and asymptotically optimal algorithm, namely Bandit Online Clustering (BOC). The algorithm includes a novel stopping rule for adaptive sequential testing that circumvents the need to exactly solve any NP-hard weighted clustering problem as its subroutines. We show through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets that BOC's performance matches the lower bound asymptotically, and significantly outperforms a non-adaptive baseline algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipschitz continuity is a crucial functional property of any predictive model, that naturally governs its robustness, generalisation, as well as adversarial vulnerability. Contrary to other works that focus on obtaining tighter bounds and developing different practical strategies to enforce certain Lipschitz properties, we aim to thoroughly examine and characterise the Lipschitz behaviour of Neural Networks. Thus, we carry out an empirical investigation in a range of different settings (namely, architectures, datasets, label noise, and more) by exhausting the limits of the simplest and the most general lower and upper bounds. As a highlight of this investigation, we showcase a remarkable fidelity of the lower Lipschitz bound, identify a striking Double Descent trend in both upper and lower bounds to the Lipschitz and explain the intriguing effects of label noise on function smoothness and generalisation.</description>

      <title>Kernel Limit of Recurrent Neural Networks Trained on Ergodic Data Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical methods are developed to characterize the asymptotics of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the number of hidden units, data samples in the sequence, hidden state updates, and training steps simultaneously grow to infinity. In the case of an RNN with a simplified weight matrix, we prove the convergence of the RNN to the solution of an infinite-dimensional ODE coupled with the fixed point of a random algebraic equation. The analysis requires addressing several challenges which are unique to RNNs. In typical mean-field applications (e.g., feedforward neural networks), discrete updates are of magnitude $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the number of updates is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Therefore, the system can be represented as an Euler approximation of an appropriate ODE/PDE, which it will converge to as $N \rightarrow \infty$. However, the RNN hidden layer updates are $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, RNNs cannot be represented as a discretization of an ODE/PDE and standard mean-field techniques cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a fixed point analysis for the evolution of the RNN memory states, with convergence estimates in terms of the number of update steps and the number of hidden units. The RNN hidden layer is studied as a function in a Sobolev space, whose evolution is governed by the data sequence (a Markov chain), the parameter updates, and its dependence on the RNN hidden layer at the previous time step. Due to the strong correlation between updates, a Poisson equation must be used to bound the fluctuations of the RNN around its limit equation. These mathematical methods give rise to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) limits for RNNs trained on data sequences as the number of data samples and size of the neural network grow to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new method for the estimation of Mutual Information (MI) between random variables. Our approach is based on an original interpretation of the Girsanov theorem, which allows us to use score-based diffusion models to estimate the Kullback Leibler divergence between two densities as a difference between their score functions. As a by-product, our method also enables the estimation of the entropy of random variables. Armed with such building blocks, we present a general recipe to measure MI, which unfolds in two directions: one uses conditional diffusion process, whereas the other uses joint diffusion processes that allow simultaneous modelling of two random variables. Our results, which derive from a thorough experimental protocol over all the variants of our approach, indicate that our method is more accurate than the main alternatives from the literature, especially for challenging distributions. Furthermore, our methods pass MI self-consistency tests, including data processing and additivity under independence, which instead are a pain-point of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Distribution Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-distribution learning (MDL), which seeks to learn a shared model that minimizes the worst-case risk across $k$ distinct data distributions, has emerged as a unified framework in response to the evolving demand for robustness, fairness, multi-group collaboration, etc. Achieving data-efficient MDL necessitates adaptive sampling, also called on-demand sampling, throughout the learning process. However, there exist substantial gaps between the state-of-the-art upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity. Focusing on a hypothesis class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension d, we propose a novel algorithm that yields an varepsilon-optimal randomized hypothesis with a sample complexity on the order of (d+k)/varepsilon^2 (modulo some logarithmic factor), matching the best-known lower bound. Our algorithmic ideas and theory are further extended to accommodate Rademacher classes. The proposed algorithms are oracle-efficient, which access the hypothesis class solely through an empirical risk minimization oracle.
  Additionally, we establish the necessity of randomization, revealing a large sample size barrier when only deterministic hypotheses are permitted. These findings resolve three open problems presented in COLT 2023 (i.e., citet[Problems 1, 3 and 4]{awasthi2023sample}).</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning for Static Panel Models with Fixed Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in causal inference have seen the development of methods which make use of the predictive power of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we use double machine learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al., 2018) to approximate high-dimensional and non-linear nuisance functions of the confounders to make inferences about the effects of policy interventions from panel data. We propose new estimators by adapting correlated random effects, within-group and first-difference estimation for linear models to an extension of Robinson (1988)'s partially linear regression model to static panel data models with individual fixed effects and unspecified non-linear confounder effects. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the relative performance of different machine learning algorithms and find that conventional least squares estimators performs well when the data generating process is mildly non-linear and smooth, but there are substantial performance gains with DML in terms of bias reduction when the true effect of the regressors is non-linear and discontinuous. However, inference based on individual learners can lead to badly biased inference. Finally, we provide an illustrative example of DML for observational panel data showing the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on voting behavior in the UK.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models in Causal Discovery: A Statistical Causal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical statistical causal discovery (SCD), embedding domain expert knowledge as constraints into the algorithm is widely accepted as significant for creating consistent meaningful causal models, despite the recognized challenges in systematic acquisition of the background knowledge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology for causal inference, in which SCD methods and knowledge based causal inference (KBCI) with a large language model (LLM) are synthesized through ``statistical causal prompting (SCP)'' for LLMs and prior knowledge augmentation for SCD. Experiments have revealed that GPT-4 can cause the output of the LLM-KBCI and the SCD result with prior knowledge from LLM-KBCI to approach the ground truth, and that the SCD result can be further improved, if GPT-4 undergoes SCP. Furthermore, by using an unpublished real-world dataset, we have demonstrated that the background knowledge provided by the LLM can improve SCD on this dataset, even if this dataset has never been included in the training data of the LLM. The proposed approach can thus address challenges such as dataset biases and limitations, illustrating the potential of LLMs to improve data-driven causal inference across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Standard Gaussian Process Can Be Excellent for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a long-standing and widespread belief that Bayesian Optimization (BO) with standard Gaussian process (GP), referred to as standard BO, is ineffective in high-dimensional optimization problems. While this belief sounds reasonable, strong empirical evidence is lacking. In this paper, we systematically investigated BO with standard GP regression across a variety of synthetic and real-world benchmark problems for high-dimensional optimization. We found that, surprisingly, when using Mat\'ern kernels and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), standard BO consistently achieves top-tier performance, often outperforming other BO methods specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization. Contrary to the stereotype, we found that standard GP equipped with Mat\'ern kernels can serve as a capable surrogate for learning high-dimensional functions. Without strong structural assumptions, BO with standard GP not only excels in high-dimensional optimization but also is robust in accommodating various structures within target functions. Furthermore, with standard GP, achieving promising optimization performance is possible via maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation with diffuse priors or merely maximum likelihood estimation, eliminating the need for expensive Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling that might be required by more complex surrogate models. In parallel, we also investigated and analyzed alternative popular settings in running standard BO, which, however, often fail in high-dimensional optimization. This might link to the a few failure cases reported in literature. We thus advocate for a re-evaluation and in-depth study of the potential of standard BO in addressing high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training is a common technique for learning robust classifiers. Prior work showed that convex surrogate losses are not statistically consistent in the adversarial context -- or in other words, a minimizing sequence of the adversarial surrogate risk will not necessarily minimize the adversarial classification error. We connect the consistency of adversarial surrogate losses to properties of minimizers to the adversarial classification risk, known as \emph{adversarial Bayes classifiers}. Specifically, under reasonable distributional assumptions, a convex loss is statistically consistent for adversarial learning iff the adversarial Bayes classifier satisfies a certain notion of uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Learning Decision Policies with Instrumental Variables through Double Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common issue in learning decision-making policies in data-rich settings is spurious correlations in the offline dataset, which can be caused by hidden confounders. Instrumental variable (IV) regression, which utilises a key unconfounded variable known as the instrument, is a standard technique for learning causal relationships between confounded action, outcome, and context variables. Most recent IV regression algorithms use a two-stage approach, where a deep neural network (DNN) estimator learnt in the first stage is directly plugged into the second stage, in which another DNN is used to estimate the causal effect. Naively plugging the estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage, especially when regularisation bias is present in the first stage estimator. We propose DML-IV, a non-linear IV regression method that reduces the bias in two-stage IV regressions and effectively learns high-performing policies. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and design the DML-IV algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. The learnt DML-IV estimator has strong convergence rate and $O(N^{-1/2})$ suboptimality guarantees that match those when the dataset is unconfounded. DML-IV outperforms state-of-the-art IV regression methods on IV regression benchmarks and learns high-performing policies in the presence of instruments.</description>
