      <title>Navigating the Future of Federated Recommendation Systems with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the integration of federated learning (FL) and recommendation systems (RSs), known as Federated Recommendation Systems (FRSs), has attracted attention for preserving user privacy by keeping private data on client devices. However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models (DMs) and large language models (LLMs), which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and NLP domains, focus on understanding and mimicking the underlying distribution of the training data. Unlike discriminative models, which learn the boundaries between categories, FMs aim to learn the entire probability distribution of the input data. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field. We hope that this survey provides the necessary background and guidance to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Specificity for Abstractive Multi-document Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-document summarization (MDS) generates a summary from a document set. Each document in a set describes topic-relevant concepts, while per document also has its unique contents. However, the document specificity receives little attention from existing MDS approaches. Neglecting specific information for each document limits the comprehensiveness of the generated summaries. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to disentangle the specific content from documents in one document set. The document-specific representations, which are encouraged to be distant from each other via a proposed orthogonal constraint, are learned by the specific representation learner. We provide extensive analysis and have interesting findings that specific information and document set representations contribute distinctive strengths and their combination yields a more comprehensive solution for the MDS. Also, we find that the common (i.e. shared) information could not contribute much to the overall performance under the MDS settings.

      <title>PyTorch-IE: Fast and Reproducible Prototyping for Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of Information Extraction (IE) is to derive structured representations from unstructured or semi-structured documents. However, developing IE models is complex due to the need of integrating several subtasks. Additionally, representation of data among varied tasks and transforming datasets into task-specific model inputs presents further challenges. To streamline this undertaking for researchers, we introduce PyTorch-IE, a deep-learning-based framework uniquely designed to enable swift, reproducible, and reusable implementations of IE models. PyTorch-IE offers a flexible data model capable of creating complex data structures by integrating interdependent layers of annotations derived from various data types, like plain text or semi-structured text, and even images. We propose task modules to decouple the concerns of data representation and model-specific representations, thereby fostering greater flexibility and reusability of code. PyTorch-IE also extends support for widely used libraries such as PyTorch-Lightning for training, HuggingFace datasets for dataset reading, and Hydra for experiment configuration. Supplementary libraries and GitHub templates for the easy setup of new projects are also provided. By ensuring functionality and versatility, PyTorch-IE provides vital support to the research community engaged in Information Extraction.</description>

      <title>KnowledgeHub: An end-to-end Tool for Assisted Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the KnowledgeHub tool, a scientific literature Information Extraction (IE) and Question Answering (QA) pipeline. This is achieved by supporting the ingestion of PDF documents that are converted to text and structured representations. An ontology can then be constructed where a user defines the types of entities and relationships they want to capture. A browser-based annotation tool enables annotating the contents of the PDF documents according to the ontology. Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Classification (RC) models can be trained on the resulting annotations and can be used to annotate the unannotated portion of the documents. A knowledge graph is constructed from these entity and relation triples which can be queried to obtain insights from the data. Furthermore, we integrate a suite of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be used for QA and summarisation that is grounded in the included documents via a retrieval component. KnowledgeHub is a unique tool that supports annotation, IE and QA, which gives the user full insight into the knowledge discovery pipeline.</description>

      <title>EnterpriseEM: Fine-tuned Embeddings for Enterprise Semantic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprises grapple with the significant challenge of managing proprietary unstructured data, hindering efficient information retrieval. This has led to the emergence of AI-driven information retrieval solutions, designed to adeptly extract relevant insights to address employee inquiries. These solutions often leverage pre-trained embedding models and generative models as foundational components. While pre-trained embeddings may exhibit proximity or disparity based on their original training objectives, they might not fully align with the unique characteristics of enterprise-specific data, leading to suboptimal alignment with the retrieval goals of enterprise environments. In this paper, we propose a methodology to fine-tune pre-trained embedding models specifically for enterprise environments. By adapting the embeddings to better suit the retrieval tasks prevalent in enterprises, we aim to enhance the performance of information retrieval solutions. We discuss the process of fine-tuning, its effect on retrieval accuracy, and the potential benefits for enterprise information management. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of fine-tuned embedding models in improving the precision and relevance of search results in enterprise settings.</description>

      <title>DisCo: Towards Harmonious Disentanglement and Collaboration between Tabular and Semantic Space for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems play important roles in various applications such as e-commerce, social media, etc. Conventional recommendation methods usually model the collaborative signals within the tabular representation space. Despite the personalization modeling and the efficiency, the latent semantic dependencies are omitted. Methods that introduce semantics into recommendation then emerge, injecting knowledge from the semantic representation space where the general language understanding are compressed. However, existing semantic-enhanced recommendation methods focus on aligning the two spaces, during which the representations of the two spaces tend to get close while the unique patterns are discarded and not well explored. In this paper, we propose DisCo to Disentangle the unique patterns from the two representation spaces and Collaborate the two spaces for recommendation enhancement, where both the specificity and the consistency of the two spaces are captured. Concretely, we propose 1) a dual-side attentive network to capture the intra-domain patterns and the inter-domain patterns, 2) a sufficiency constraint to preserve the task-relevant information of each representation space and filter out the noise, and 3) a disentanglement constraint to avoid the model from discarding the unique information. These modules strike a balance between disentanglement and collaboration of the two representation spaces to produce informative pattern vectors, which could serve as extra features and be appended to arbitrary recommendation backbones for enhancement. Experiment results validate the superiority of our method against different models and the compatibility of DisCo over different backbones. Various ablation studies and efficiency analysis are also conducted to justify each model component.</description>

      <title>Extracting Essential and Disentangled Knowledge for Recommendation Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender models play a vital role in various industrial scenarios, while often faced with the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by the fast shifting data distribution, e.g., the evolving user interests, click signals fluctuation during sales promotions, etc. To alleviate this problem, a common approach is to reuse knowledge from the historical data. However, preserving the vast and fast-accumulating data is hard, which causes dramatic storage overhead. Memorizing old data through a parametric knowledge base is then proposed, which compresses the vast amount of raw data into model parameters. Despite the flexibility, how to improve the memorization and generalization capabilities of the parametric knowledge base is challenging. In this paper, we propose two constraints to extract Essential and Disentangled Knowledge from past data for rational and generalized recommendation enhancement, which improves the capabilities of the parametric knowledge base without increasing the size of it. The essential principle helps to compress the input into representative vectors that capture the task-relevant information and filter out the noisy information. The disentanglement principle reduces the redundancy of stored information and pushes the knowledge base to focus on capturing the disentangled invariant patterns. These two rules together promote rational compression of information for robust and generalized knowledge representations. Extensive experiments on two datasets justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Thesis: Document Summarization with applications to Keyword extraction and Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document in order to generate a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. In this work, we study two problems - i) summarizing a text document as set of keywords/caption, for image recommedation, ii) generating opinion summary which good mix of relevancy and sentiment with the text document. Intially, we present our work on an recommending images for enhancing a substantial amount of existing plain text news articles. We use probabilistic models and word similarity heuristics to generate captions and extract Key-phrases which are re-ranked using a rank aggregation framework with relevance feedback mechanism. We show that such rank aggregation and relevant feedback which are typically used in Tagging Documents, Text Information Retrieval also helps in improving image retrieval. These queries are fed to the Yahoo Search Engine to obtain relevant images 1. Our proposed method is observed to perform better than all existing baselines. Additonally, We propose a set of submodular functions for opinion summarization. Opinion summarization has built in it the tasks of summarization and sentiment detection. However, it is not easy to detect sentiment and simultaneously extract summary. The two tasks conflict in the sense that the demand of compression may drop sentiment bearing sentences, and the demand of sentiment detection may bring in redundant sentences. However, using submodularity we show how to strike a balance between the two requirements. Our functions generate summaries such that there is good correlation between document sentiment and summary sentiment along with good ROUGE score. We also compare the performances of the proposed submodular functions.</description>

      <title>ImplicitSLIM and How it Improves Embedding-based Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ImplicitSLIM, a novel unsupervised learning approach for sparse high-dimensional data, with applications to collaborative filtering. Sparse linear methods (SLIM) and their variations show outstanding performance, but they are memory-intensive and hard to scale. ImplicitSLIM improves embedding-based models by extracting embeddings from SLIM-like models in a computationally cheap and memory-efficient way, without explicit learning of heavy SLIM-like models. We show that ImplicitSLIM improves performance and speeds up convergence for both state of the art and classical collaborative filtering methods. The source code for ImplicitSLIM, related models, and applications is available at https://github.com/ilya-shenbin/ImplicitSLIM.</description>

      <title>LLM-RankFusion: Mitigating Intrinsic Inconsistency in LLM-based Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking passages by prompting a large language model (LLM) can achieve promising performance in modern information retrieval (IR) systems. A common approach is to sort the ranking list by prompting LLMs for pairwise comparison. However, sorting-based methods require consistent comparisons to correctly sort the passages, which we show that LLMs often violate. We identify two kinds of intrinsic inconsistency in LLM-based pairwise comparisons: order inconsistency which leads to conflicting results when switching the passage order, and transitive inconsistency which leads to non-transitive triads among all preference pairs. In this paper, we propose LLM-RankFusion, an LLM-based ranking framework that mitigates these inconsistencies and produces a robust ranking list. LLM-RankFusion mitigates order inconsistency using in-context learning (ICL) to demonstrate order-agnostic comparisons and calibration to estimate the underlying preference probability between two passages. We then address transitive inconsistency by aggregating the ranking results from multiple rankers. In our experiments, we empirically show that LLM-RankFusion can significantly reduce inconsistent pairwise comparison results, and improve the ranking quality by making the final ranking list more robust.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Relevance Judgment in Product Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High relevance of retrieved and re-ranked items to the search query is the cornerstone of successful product search, yet measuring relevance of items to queries is one of the most challenging tasks in product information retrieval, and quality of product search is highly influenced by the precision and scale of available relevance-labelled data. In this paper, we present an array of techniques for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the relevance judgment of query-item pairs (QIPs) at scale. Using a unique dataset of multi-million QIPs, annotated by human evaluators, we test and optimize hyper parameters for finetuning billion-parameter LLMs with and without Low Rank Adaption (LoRA), as well as various modes of item attribute concatenation and prompting in LLM finetuning, and consider trade offs in item attribute inclusion for quality of relevance predictions. We demonstrate considerable improvement over baselines of prior generations of LLMs, as well as off-the-shelf models, towards relevance annotations on par with the human relevance evaluators. Our findings have immediate implications for the growing field of relevance judgment automation in product search.</description>

      <title>BeFA: A General Behavior-driven Feature Adapter for Multimedia Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimedia recommender systems focus on utilizing behavioral information and content information to model user preferences. Typically, it employs pre-trained feature encoders to extract content features, then fuses them with behavioral features. However, pre-trained feature encoders often extract features from the entire content simultaneously, including excessive preference-irrelevant details. We speculate that it may result in the extracted features not containing sufficient features to accurately reflect user preferences. To verify our hypothesis, we introduce an attribution analysis method for visually and intuitively analyzing the content features. The results indicate that certain products' content features exhibit the issues of information drift}and information omission,reducing the expressive ability of features. Building upon this finding, we propose an effective and efficient general Behavior-driven Feature Adapter (BeFA) to tackle these issues. This adapter reconstructs the content feature with the guidance of behavioral information, enabling content features accurately reflecting user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the adapter across all multimedia recommendation methods. The code will be publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.</description>

      <title>A Practice-Friendly Two-Stage LLM-Enhanced Paradigm in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training paradigm integrating large language models (LLM) is gradually reshaping sequential recommender systems (SRS) and has shown promising results. However, most existing LLM-enhanced methods rely on rich textual information on the item side and instance-level supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to inject collaborative information into LLM, which is inefficient and limited in many applications. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a novel practice-friendly two-stage LLM-enhanced paradigm (TSLRec) for SRS. Specifically, in the information reconstruction stage, we design a new user-level SFT task for collaborative information injection with the assistance of a pre-trained SRS model, which is more efficient and compatible with limited text information. We aim to let LLM try to infer the latent category of each item and reconstruct the corresponding user's preference distribution for all categories from the user's interaction sequence. In the information augmentation stage, we feed each item into LLM to obtain a set of enhanced embeddings that combine collaborative information and LLM inference capabilities. These embeddings can then be used to help train various future SRS models. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our TSLRec on three SRS benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Making Recommender Systems More Knowledgeable: A Framework to Incorporate Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based recommender systems typically focus on using only the triplet (user_id, timestamp, item_id) to make predictions of users' next actions. In this paper, we aim to utilize side information to help recommender systems catch patterns and signals otherwise undetectable. Specifically, we propose a general framework for incorporating item-specific side information into the recommender system to enhance its performance without much modification on the original model architecture. Experimental results on several models and datasets prove that with side information, our recommender system outperforms state-of-the-art models by a considerable margin and converges much faster. Additionally, we propose a new type of loss to regularize the attention mechanism used by recommender systems and evaluate its influence on model performance. Furthermore, through analysis, we put forward a few insights on potential further improvements.</description>

      <title>COS-Mix: Cosine Similarity and Distance Fusion for Improved Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel hybrid retrieval strategy for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that integrates cosine similarity and cosine distance measures to improve retrieval performance, particularly for sparse data. The traditional cosine similarity measure is widely used to capture the similarity between vectors in high-dimensional spaces. However, it has been shown that this measure can yield arbitrary results in certain scenarios. To address this limitation, we incorporate cosine distance measures to provide a complementary perspective by quantifying the dissimilarity between vectors. Our approach is experimented on proprietary data, unlike recent publications that have used open-source datasets. The proposed method demonstrates enhanced retrieval performance and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic relationships between documents or items. This hybrid strategy offers a promising solution for efficiently and accurately retrieving relevant information in knowledge-intensive applications, leveraging techniques such as BM25 (sparse) retrieval , vector (Dense) retrieval, and cosine distance based retrieval to facilitate efficient information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Entropy Regularized Decision Transformer with Reward Relabelling for Dynamic Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems have recently gained popularity. However, due to the typical limitations of simulation environments (e.g., data inefficiency), most of the work cannot be broadly applied in all domains. To counter these challenges, recent advancements have leveraged offline reinforcement learning methods, notable for their data-driven approach utilizing offline datasets. A prominent example of this is the Decision Transformer. Despite its popularity, the Decision Transformer approach has inherent drawbacks, particularly evident in recommendation methods based on it. This paper identifies two key shortcomings in existing Decision Transformer-based methods: a lack of stitching capability and limited effectiveness in online adoption. In response, we introduce a novel methodology named Max-Entropy enhanced Decision Transformer with Reward Relabeling for Offline RLRS (EDT4Rec). Our approach begins with a max entropy perspective, leading to the development of a max entropy enhanced exploration strategy. This strategy is designed to facilitate more effective exploration in online environments. Additionally, to augment the model's capability to stitch sub-optimal trajectories, we incorporate a unique reward relabeling technique. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of EDT4Rec, we have conducted comprehensive experiments across six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulator.</description>

      <title>Cold-start Recommendation by Personalized Embedding Region Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rating elicitation is a success element for recommender systems to perform well at cold-starting, in which the systems need to recommend items to a newly arrived user with no prior knowledge about the user's preference. Existing elicitation methods employ a fixed set of items to learn the user's preference and then infer the users' preferences on the remaining items. Using a fixed seed set can limit the performance of the recommendation system since the seed set is unlikely optimal for all new users with potentially diverse preferences. This paper addresses this challenge using a 2-phase, personalized elicitation scheme. First, the elicitation scheme asks users to rate a small set of popular items in a ``burn-in'' phase. Second, it sequentially asks the user to rate adaptive items to refine the preference and the user's representation. Throughout the process, the system represents the user's embedding value not by a point estimate but by a region estimate. The value of information obtained by asking the user's rating on an item is quantified by the distance from the region center embedding space that contains with high confidence the true embedding value of the user. Finally, the recommendations are successively generated by considering the preference region of the user. We show that each subproblem in the elicitation scheme can be efficiently implemented. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing rating-elicitation methods on several prominent datasets.</description>

      <title>FourierKAN-GCF: Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network -- An Effective and Efficient Feature Transformation for Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF) has achieved state-of-the-art performance for recommendation tasks. However, most GCF structures simplify the feature transformation and nonlinear operation during message passing in the graph convolution network (GCN). We revisit these two components and discover that a part of feature transformation and nonlinear operation during message passing in GCN can improve the representation of GCF, but increase the difficulty of training.
  In this work, we propose a simple and effective graph-based recommendation model called FourierKAN-GCF. Specifically, it utilizes a novel Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to replace the multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a part of the feature transformation during message passing in GCN, which improves the representation power of GCF and is easy to train. We further employ message dropout and node dropout strategies to improve the representation power and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of FourierKAN-GCF over most state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Jinfeng-Xu/FKAN-GCF.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Generative Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Retrieval (GR) is an emerging paradigm in information retrieval that leverages generative models to directly map queries to relevant document identifiers (DocIDs) without the need for traditional query processing or document reranking. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GR, highlighting key developments, indexing and retrieval strategies, and challenges. We discuss various document identifier strategies, including numerical and string-based identifiers, and explore different document representation methods. Our primary contribution lies in outlining future research directions that could profoundly impact the field: improving the quality of query generation, exploring learnable document identifiers, enhancing scalability, and integrating GR with multi-task learning frameworks. By examining state-of-the-art GR techniques and their applications, this survey aims to provide a foundational understanding of GR and inspire further innovations in this transformative approach to information retrieval. We also make the complementary materials such as paper collection publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/GenIR-Survey/</description>

      <title>Multi-word Term Embeddings Improve Lexical Product Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product search is uniquely different from search for documents, Internet resources or vacancies, therefore it requires the development of specialized search systems. The present work describes the H1 embdedding model, designed for an offline term indexing of product descriptions at e-commerce platforms. The model is compared to other state-of-the-art (SoTA) embedding models within a framework of hybrid product search system that incorporates the advantages of lexical methods for product retrieval and semantic embedding-based methods. We propose an approach to building semantically rich term vocabularies for search indexes. Compared to other production semantic models, H1 paired with the proposed approach stands out due to its ability to process multi-word product terms as one token. As an example, for search queries "new balance shoes", "gloria jeans kids wear" brand entity will be represented as one token - "new balance", "gloria jeans". This results in an increased precision of the system without affecting the recall. The hybrid search system with proposed model scores mAP@12 = 56.1% and R@1k = 86.6% on the WANDS public dataset, beating other SoTA analogues.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Recommender Systems: A Study of Popularity Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of popularity bias -- where popular items are disproportionately recommended, overshadowing less popular but potentially relevant items -- remains a significant challenge in recommender systems. Recent advancements have seen the integration of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) into the architecture of such systems. This integration raises concerns that it might exacerbate popularity bias, given that the LLM's training data is likely dominated by popular items. However, it simultaneously presents a novel opportunity to address the bias via prompt tuning. Our study explores this dichotomy, examining whether LLMs contribute to or can alleviate popularity bias in recommender systems. We introduce a principled way to measure popularity bias by discussing existing metrics and proposing a novel metric that fulfills a series of desiderata. Based on our new metric, we compare a simple LLM-based recommender to traditional recommender systems on a movie recommendation task. We find that the LLM recommender exhibits less popularity bias, even without any explicit mitigation.</description>

      <title>KU-DMIS at EHRSQL 2024:Generating SQL query via question templatization in EHR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming natural language questions into SQL queries is crucial for precise data retrieval from electronic health record (EHR) databases. A significant challenge in this process is detecting and rejecting unanswerable questions that request information beyond the database's scope or exceed the system's capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel text-to-SQL framework that robustly handles out-of-domain questions and verifies the generated queries with query execution.Our framework begins by standardizing the structure of questions into a templated format. We use a powerful large language model (LLM), fine-tuned GPT-3.5 with detailed prompts involving the table schemas of the EHR database system. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the EHRSQL-2024 benchmark benchmark, a shared task in the ClinicalNLP workshop. Although a straightforward fine-tuning of GPT shows promising results on the development set, it struggled with the out-of-domain questions in the test set. With our framework, we improve our system's adaptability and achieve competitive performances in the official leaderboard of the EHRSQL-2024 challenge.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models' Detection of Political Orientation in Newspapers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Democratic opinion-forming may be manipulated if newspapers' alignment to political or economical orientation is ambiguous. Various methods have been developed to better understand newspapers' positioning. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLM), and particularly the pre-trained LLM chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, hold disruptive potential to assist researchers and citizens alike. However, little is know on whether LLM assessment is trustworthy: do single LLM agrees with experts' assessment, and do different LLMs answer consistently with one another? In this paper, we address specifically the second challenge. We compare how four widely employed LLMs rate the positioning of newspapers, and compare if their answers align with one another. We observe that this is not the case. Over a woldwide dataset, articles in newspapers are positioned strikingly differently by single LLMs, hinting to inconsistent training or excessive randomness in the algorithms. We thus raise a warning when deciding which tools to use, and we call for better training and algorithm development, to cover such significant gap in a highly sensitive matter for democracy and societies worldwide. We also call for community engagement in benchmark evaluation, through our open initiative navai.pro.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EHR-SeqSQL, a novel sequential text-to-SQL dataset for Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases. EHR-SeqSQL is designed to address critical yet underexplored aspects in text-to-SQL parsing: interactivity, compositionality, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, EHR-SeqSQL is not only the largest but also the first medical text-to-SQL dataset benchmark to include sequential and contextual questions. We provide a data split and the new test set designed to assess compositional generalization ability. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of a multi-turn approach over a single-turn approach in learning compositionality. Additionally, our dataset integrates specially crafted tokens into SQL queries to improve execution efficiency. With EHR-SeqSQL, we aim to bridge the gap between practical needs and academic research in the text-to-SQL domain.</description>

      <title>Adapting PromptORE for Modern History: Information Extraction from Hispanic Monarchy Documents of the XVIth Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic relations among entities are a widely accepted method for relation extraction. PromptORE (Prompt-based Open Relation Extraction) was designed to improve relation extraction with Large Language Models on generalistic documents. However, it is less effective when applied to historical documents, in languages other than English. In this study, we introduce an adaptation of PromptORE to extract relations from specialized documents, namely digital transcripts of trials from the Spanish Inquisition. Our approach involves fine-tuning transformer models with their pretraining objective on the data they will perform inference. We refer to this process as "biasing". Our Biased PromptORE addresses complex entity placements and genderism that occur in Spanish texts. We solve these issues by prompt engineering. We evaluate our method using Encoder-like models, corroborating our findings with experts' assessments. Additionally, we evaluate the performance using a binomial classification benchmark. Our results show a substantial improvement in accuracy -up to a 50% improvement with our Biased PromptORE models in comparison to the baseline models using standard PromptORE.</description>

      <title>KGLink: A column type annotation method that combines knowledge graph and pre-trained language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semantic annotation of tabular data plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks. Previous research has proposed knowledge graph (KG)-based and deep learning-based methods, each with its inherent limitations. KG-based methods encounter difficulties annotating columns when there is no match for column cells in the KG. Moreover, KG-based methods can provide multiple predictions for one column, making it challenging to determine the semantic type with the most suitable granularity for the dataset. This type granularity issue limits their scalability.
  On the other hand, deep learning-based methods face challenges related to the valuable context missing issue. This occurs when the information within the table is insufficient for determining the correct column type.
  This paper presents KGLink, a method that combines WikiData KG information with a pre-trained deep learning language model for table column annotation, effectively addressing both type granularity and valuable context missing issues. Through comprehensive experiments on widely used tabular datasets encompassing numeric and string columns with varying type granularity, we showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of KGLink. By leveraging the strengths of KGLink, we successfully surmount challenges related to type granularity and valuable context issues, establishing it as a robust solution for the semantic annotation of tabular data.</description>

      <title>Unveil the Duality of Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Theoretical Analysis and Practical Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance large language models (LLMs). However, studies show that RAG is not consistently effective and can even mislead LLMs due to noisy or incorrect retrieved texts. This suggests that RAG possesses a duality including both benefit and detriment. Although many existing methods attempt to address this issue, they lack a theoretical explanation for the duality in RAG. The benefit and detriment within this duality remain a black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner. This paper takes the first step in theoretically giving the essential explanation of benefit and detriment in RAG by: (1) decoupling and formalizing them from RAG prediction, (2) approximating the gap between their values by representation similarity and (3) establishing the trade-off mechanism between them, to make them explainable, quantifiable, and comparable. We demonstrate that the distribution difference between retrieved texts and LLMs' knowledge acts as double-edged sword, bringing both benefit and detriment. We also prove that the actual effect of RAG can be predicted at token level. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method, X-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between pure LLM and RAG at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in real-world tasks based on LLMs including OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Attacks and Defenses in Recommender Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems (RS) have profoundly enhanced user experience across digital platforms, yet they face significant threats from poisoning attacks. These attacks, aimed at manipulating recommendation outputs for unethical gains, exploit vulnerabilities in RS through injecting malicious data or intervening model training. This survey presents a unique perspective by examining these threats through the lens of an attacker, offering fresh insights into their mechanics and impacts. Concretely, we detail a systematic pipeline that encompasses four stages of a poisoning attack: setting attack goals, assessing attacker capabilities, analyzing victim architecture, and implementing poisoning strategies. The pipeline not only aligns with various attack tactics but also serves as a comprehensive taxonomy to pinpoint focuses of distinct poisoning attacks. Correspondingly, we further classify defensive strategies into two main categories: poisoning data filtering and robust training from the defender's perspective. Finally, we highlight existing limitations and suggest innovative directions for further exploration in this field.</description>

      <title>Privacy in LLM-based Recommendation: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with conventional recommendation models to improve recommendation performance. However, while most of the existing works have focused on improving the model performance, the privacy issue has only received comparatively less attention. In this paper, we review recent advancements in privacy within LLM-based recommendation, categorizing them into privacy attacks and protection mechanisms. Additionally, we highlight several challenges and propose future directions for the community to address these critical problems.</description>

      <title>Word frequency and sentiment analysis of twitter messages during Coronavirus pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.03925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a great impact on social media conversation, especially on sites like Twitter, which has emerged as a hub for public reaction and information sharing. This paper deals by analyzing a vast dataset of Twitter messages related to this disease, starting from January 2020. Two approaches were used: a statistical analysis of word frequencies and a sentiment analysis to gauge user attitudes. Word frequencies are modeled using unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, with power law distribution as the fitting model. The validity of the model is confirmed through metrics like Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), R-squared ($R^2$), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). High $R^2$ and low SSE/RMSE values indicate a good fit for the model. Sentiment analysis is conducted to understand the general emotional tone of Twitter users messages. The results reveal that a majority of tweets exhibit neutral sentiment polarity, with only 2.57\% expressing negative polarity.</description>

      <title>RLTP: Reinforcement Learning to Pace for Delayed Impression Modeling in Preloaded Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To increase brand awareness, many advertisers conclude contracts with advertising platforms to purchase traffic and then deliver advertisements to target audiences. In a whole delivery period, advertisers usually desire a certain impression count for the ads, and they also expect that the delivery performance is as good as possible (e.g., obtaining high click-through rate). Advertising platforms employ pacing algorithms to satisfy the demands via adjusting the selection probabilities to traffic requests in real-time. However, the delivery procedure is also affected by the strategies from publishers, which cannot be controlled by advertising platforms. Preloading is a widely used strategy for many types of ads (e.g., video ads) to make sure that the response time for displaying after a traffic request is legitimate, which results in delayed impression phenomenon. Traditional pacing algorithms cannot handle the preloading nature well because they rely on immediate feedback signals, and may fail to guarantee the demands from advertisers.
  In this paper, we focus on a new research problem of impression pacing for preloaded ads, and propose a Reinforcement Learning To Pace framework RLTP. It learns a pacing agent that sequentially produces selection probabilities in the whole delivery period. To jointly optimize the two objectives of impression count and delivery performance, RLTP employs tailored reward estimator to satisfy the guaranteed impression count, penalize the over-delivery and maximize the traffic value. Experiments on large-scale industrial datasets verify that RLTP outperforms baseline pacing algorithms by a large margin. We have deployed the RLTP framework online to our advertising platform, and results show that it achieves significant uplift to core metrics including delivery completion rate and click-through rate.</description>

      <title>Category-Oriented Representation Learning for Image to Multi-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of multi-modal search requests from users has highlighted the importance of multi-modal retrieval (i.e. image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval), yet the more complex task of image-to-multi-modal retrieval, crucial for many industry applications, remains under-explored. To address this gap and promote further research, we introduce and define the concept of Image-to-Multi-Modal Retrieval (IMMR), a process designed to retrieve rich multi-modal (i.e. image and text) documents based on image queries. We focus on representation learning for IMMR and analyze three key challenges for it: 1) skewed data and noisy label in real-world industrial data, 2) the information-inequality between image and text modality of documents when learning representations, 3) effective and efficient training in large-scale industrial contexts. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel framework named organizing categories and learning by classification for retrieval (OCLEAR). It consists of three components: 1) a novel category-oriented data governance scheme coupled with a large-scale classification-based learning paradigm, which handles the skewed and noisy data from a data perspective. 2) model architecture specially designed for multi-modal learning, where information-inequality between image and text modality of documents is considered for modality fusion. 3) a hybrid parallel training approach for tackling large-scale training in industrial scenario. The proposed framework achieves SOTA performance on public datasets and has been deployed in a real-world industrial e-commence system, leading to significant business growth. Code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>mdendro: An R package for extended agglomerative hierarchical clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "mdendro" is an R package that provides a comprehensive collection of linkage methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering on a matrix of proximity data (distances or similarities), returning a multifurcated dendrogram or multidendrogram. Multidendrograms can group more than two clusters at the same time, solving the nonuniqueness problem that arises when there are ties in the data. This problem causes that different binary dendrograms are possible depending both on the order of the input data and on the criterion used to break ties. Weighted and unweighted versions of the most common linkage methods are included in the package, which also implements two parametric linkage methods. In addition, package "mdendro" provides five descriptive measures to analyze the resulting dendrograms: cophenetic correlation coefficient, space distortion ratio, agglomeration coefficient, chaining coefficient and tree balance.</description>

      <title>FABULA: Intelligence Report Generation Using Retrieval-Augmented Narrative Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrative construction is the process of representing disparate event information into a logical plot structure that models an end to end story. Intelligence analysis is an example of a domain that can benefit tremendously from narrative construction techniques, particularly in aiding analysts during the largely manual and costly process of synthesizing event information into comprehensive intelligence reports. Manual intelligence report generation is often prone to challenges such as integrating dynamic event information, writing fine-grained queries, and closing information gaps. This motivates the development of a system that retrieves and represents critical aspects of events in a form that aids in automatic generation of intelligence reports.
  We introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to augment prompting of an autoregressive decoder by retrieving structured information asserted in a knowledge graph to generate targeted information based on a narrative plot model. We apply our approach to the problem of neural intelligence report generation and introduce FABULA, framework to augment intelligence analysis workflows using RAG. An analyst can use FABULA to query an Event Plot Graph (EPG) to retrieve relevant event plot points, which can be used to augment prompting of a Large Language Model (LLM) during intelligence report generation. Our evaluation studies show that the plot points included in the generated intelligence reports have high semantic relevance, high coherency, and low data redundancy.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Adaptation of Large Language Models for Text Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text ranking is a critical task in information retrieval. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs), especially large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities for applying them to text ranking. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with ranking data has been widely explored to better align PLMs with text ranking goals, previous studies have focused primarily on encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs. Research on leveraging decoder-only LLMs for text ranking remains scarce. An exception to this is RankLLaMA, which uses direct SFT to explore LLaMA's potential for text ranking. In this work, we propose a two-stage progressive paradigm to better adapt LLMs to text ranking. First, we conduct continual pre-training (CPT) of LLMs on a large weakly-supervised corpus. Second, we perform SFT, and propose an improved optimization strategy building upon RankLLaMA. Our experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our approach outperforms previous methods in both in-domain and out-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>PRE: A Peer Review Based Large Language Model Evaluator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable attention from the academic and industrial communities. Besides how to construct and train LLMs, how to effectively evaluate and compare the capacity of LLMs has also been well recognized as an important yet difficult problem. Existing paradigms rely on either human annotators or model-based evaluators to evaluate the performance of LLMs on different tasks. However, these paradigms often suffer from high cost, low generalizability, and inherited biases in practice, which make them incapable of supporting the sustainable development of LLMs in long term. In order to address these issues, inspired by the peer review systems widely used in academic publication process, we propose a novel framework that can automatically evaluate LLMs through a peer-review process. Specifically, for the evaluation of a specific task, we first construct a small qualification exam to select "reviewers" from a couple of powerful LLMs. Then, to actually evaluate the "submissions" written by different candidate LLMs, i.e., the evaluatees, we use the reviewer LLMs to rate or compare the submissions. The final ranking of evaluatee LLMs is generated based on the results provided by all reviewers. We conducted extensive experiments on text summarization tasks with eleven LLMs including GPT-4. The results demonstrate the existence of biasness when evaluating using a single LLM. Also, our PRE model outperforms all the baselines, illustrating the effectiveness of the peer review mechanism.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Conversational Dense Retrieval by Rewriting-Enhanced Inversion of Session Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational dense retrieval has shown to be effective in conversational search. However, a major limitation of conversational dense retrieval is their lack of interpretability, hindering intuitive understanding of model behaviors for targeted improvements. This paper presents CONVINV, a simple yet effective approach to shed light on interpretable conversational dense retrieval models. CONVINV transforms opaque conversational session embeddings into explicitly interpretable text while faithfully maintaining their original retrieval performance as much as possible. Such transformation is achieved by training a recently proposed Vec2Text model based on the ad-hoc query encoder, leveraging the fact that the session and query embeddings share the same space in existing conversational dense retrieval. To further enhance interpretability, we propose to incorporate external interpretable query rewrites into the transformation process. Extensive evaluations on three conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that CONVINV can yield more interpretable text and faithfully preserve original retrieval performance than baselines. Our work connects opaque session embeddings with transparent query rewriting, paving the way toward trustworthy conversational search.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models meet Collaborative Filtering: An Efficient All-round LLM-based Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering recommender systems (CF-RecSys) have shown successive results in enhancing the user experience on social media and e-commerce platforms. However, as CF-RecSys struggles under cold scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, recent strategies have focused on leveraging modality information of user/items (e.g., text or images) based on pre-trained modality encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their effectiveness under cold scenarios, we observe that they underperform simple traditional collaborative filtering models under warm scenarios due to the lack of collaborative knowledge. In this work, we propose an efficient All-round LLM-based Recommender system, called A-LLMRec, that excels not only in the cold scenario but also in the warm scenario. Our main idea is to enable an LLM to directly leverage the collaborative knowledge contained in a pre-trained state-of-the-art CF-RecSys so that the emergent ability of the LLM as well as the high-quality user/item embeddings that are already trained by the state-of-the-art CF-RecSys can be jointly exploited. This approach yields two advantages: (1) model-agnostic, allowing for integration with various existing CF-RecSys, and (2) efficiency, eliminating the extensive fine-tuning typically required for LLM-based recommenders. Our extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A-LLMRec in various scenarios, including cold/warm, few-shot, cold user, and cross-domain scenarios. Beyond the recommendation task, we also show the potential of A-LLMRec in generating natural language outputs based on the understanding of the collaborative knowledge by performing a favorite genre prediction task. Our code is available at https://github.com/ghdtjr/A-LLMRec .</description>

      <title>Learning Partially Aligned Item Representation for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to uncover and transfer users' sequential preferences across multiple recommendation domains. While significant endeavors have been made, they primarily concentrated on developing advanced transfer modules and aligning user representations using self-supervised learning techniques. However, the problem of aligning item representations has received limited attention, and misaligned item representations can potentially lead to sub-optimal sequential modeling and user representation alignment. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework called \textbf{C}ross-domain item representation \textbf{A}lignment for \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{S}equential \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{CA-CDSR}), which achieves sequence-aware generation and adaptively partial alignment for item representations. Specifically, we first develop a sequence-aware feature augmentation strategy, which captures both collaborative and sequential item correlations, thus facilitating holistic item representation generation. Next, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the partial representation alignment problem from a spectrum perspective. It motivates us to devise an adaptive spectrum filter, achieving partial alignment adaptively. Furthermore, the aligned item representations can be fed into different sequential encoders to obtain user representations. The entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm with an annealing strategy. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that CA-CDSR can surpass state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin and can effectively align items in representation spaces to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Dataset Regeneration for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequential recommender (SR) system is a crucial component of modern recommender systems, as it aims to capture the evolving preferences of users. Significant efforts have been made to enhance the capabilities of SR systems. These methods typically follow the model-centric paradigm, which involves developing effective models based on fixed datasets. However, this approach often overlooks potential quality issues and flaws inherent in the data. Driven by the potential of data-centric AI, we propose a novel data-centric paradigm for developing an ideal training dataset using a model-agnostic dataset regeneration framework called DR4SR. This framework enables the regeneration of a dataset with exceptional cross-architecture generalizability. Additionally, we introduce the DR4SR+ framework, which incorporates a model-aware dataset personalizer to tailor the regenerated dataset specifically for a target model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the data-centric paradigm, we integrate our framework with various model-centric methods and observe significant performance improvements across four widely adopted datasets. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analyses to explore the potential of the data-centric paradigm and provide valuable insights.

      <title>Rewriting the Code: A Simple Method for Large Language Model Augmented Code Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In code search, the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, which generates exemplar code snippets to augment queries, has emerged as a promising strategy to address the principal challenge of modality misalignment between code snippets and natural language queries, particularly with the demonstrated code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, our preliminary investigations indicate that the improvements conferred by such an LLM-augmented framework are somewhat constrained. This limitation could potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6%), and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6%) retrieval settings in diverse search scenarios. To further elucidate the advantages of ReCo and stimulate research in code style normalization, we introduce Code Style Similarity, the first metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities in code. Notably, our empirical findings reveal the inadequacy of existing metrics in capturing stylistic nuances.

      <title>FedHCDR: Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation with Hypergraph Signal Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has drawn significant attention, which utilizes user data from multiple domains to enhance the recommendation performance. However, current CDR methods require sharing user data across domains, thereby violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed for Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation (FedCDR). Nevertheless, the data heterogeneity across different domains inevitably influences the overall performance of federated learning. In this study, we propose FedHCDR, a novel Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation framework with Hypergraph signal decoupling. Specifically, to address the data heterogeneity across domains, we introduce an approach called hypergraph signal decoupling (HSD) to decouple the user features into domain-exclusive and domain-shared features. The approach employs high-pass and low-pass hypergraph filters to decouple domain-exclusive and domain-shared user representations, which are trained by the local-global bi-directional transfer algorithm. In addition, a hypergraph contrastive learning (HCL) module is devised to enhance the learning of domain-shared user relationship information by perturbing the user hypergraph. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world scenarios demonstrate that FedHCDR outperforms existing baselines significantly.</description>
