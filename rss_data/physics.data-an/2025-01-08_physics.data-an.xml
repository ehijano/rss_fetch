      <title>Precision Evaluation Criteria for Simulation Algorithms in Infinite Systems: A Network Model-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the particle count escalates, the computational demands of diverse simulation algorithms surge, paralleled by a marked enhancement in accuracy. The question arises whether this heightened precision asymptotically dwindles towards zero or plateaus at a finite constant. To address this, this work introduces an approach that translates infinite systems into finite-node network architectures, providing a rigorous framework for assessing this question. Employing the Monte Carlo algorithm's application to the Ising model as a case study, this paper demonstrate that despite the simulation's extension to an infinite lattice size, a fundamental error bound persists. This work explicitly derive this lower bound on the error, offering a quantitative understanding of the algorithm's limitations in the limit of infinite scale. Furthermore, I extend this methodology to Molecular Dynamics simulations, exemplified through its application to battery systems. This conversion strategy not only underscores the generality of this approach but also highlights its practical significance in guiding the optimization of simulation algorithms. Moreover, it offers insights into estimating micro-level information from macro-level data. The crucial information of Molecular Simulation, namely the potential energy, has been quickly estimated.</description>

      <title>Utilizing long memory and circulation patterns for stochastic forecasts of temperature extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long memory and circulation patterns are potential sources of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions. Here, we infer one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic models of daily temperature which capture both long memory and external driving by the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index. To this end, we employ a data-driven method which combines fractional calculus and stochastic difference equations. A causal analysis of AO and North-Atlantic Oscillation indices and European daily extreme temperatures reveals the largest influence of the AO index on winter temperature in southern Scandinavia. Stochastic temperature forecasts for Visby Flygplats, Sweden, show significantly improved performance for long memory models. Binary temperature forecasts show predictive power for up to 20 (11) days lead time for maximum (minimum) daily temperature (66% CI) while an AR(1) model possesses predictive power for 8 (3) days lead time for daily maximum (minimum) temperature (66% CI). Our results show the potential of long memory and circulation patterns for extreme temperature forecasts.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and intellectual oversight.</description>

      <title>Supervised and unsupervised learning the many-body critical phase, phase transitions and critical exponents in disordered quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence based on SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence (CE) with effective information (EI) posits that complex systems can exhibit CE, where macro-dynamics show stronger causal effects than micro-dynamics. A key challenge of this theory is its dependence on coarse-graining method. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this. By applying singular value decomposition(SVD) to Markov dynamics, we find that the essence of CE lies in the presence of redundancy, represented by the irreversible and correlated information pathways. Therefore, CE can be quantified as the potential maximal efficiency increase for dynamical reversibility or information transmission. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the approximate dynamical reversibility and EI, establishing an equivalence between the SVD and EI maximization frameworks for quantifying CE, supported by theoretical insights and numerical examples from Boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks. Importantly, our SVD-based CE framework is independent of specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the fundamental characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>
