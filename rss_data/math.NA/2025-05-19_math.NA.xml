      <title>Surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood discretization of the transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of positive quantities underlies countless physical processes, including fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics. Discretizing the associated partial differential equations with Galerkin methods can result in spurious nonpositivity of solutions. We observe that these methods amount to performing statistical inference using the method of moments (MoM) and that the loss of positivity arises from MoM's susceptibility to producing estimates inconsistent with the observed data. We overcome this problem by replacing MoM with maximum likelihood estimation, introducing $\textit{maximum likelihood discretization} $(MLD). In the continuous limit, MLD simplifies to the Fisher-Rao Galerkin (FRG) semidiscretization, which replaces the $L^2$ inner product in Galerkin projection with the Fisher-Rao metric of probability distributions. We show empirically that FRG preserves positivity. We prove rigorously that it yields error bounds in the Kullback-Leibler divergence.</description>

      <title>A high-order Newton multigrid method for steady-state shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-order Newton multigrid method is proposed for simulating steady-state shallow water flows in open channels with regular and irregular geometries. The method integrates two components: (1) a finite volume discretization with third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction for the governing shallow water equations, (2) a Newton-multigrid method with an efficient approximation of the Jacobian matrix for the resulting discrete system. Generating the full Jacobian matrix in Newton iterations causes substantial computational costs. To address this problem, we observe that the majority of the non-zero elements in the matrix exhibit negligible magnitudes. By eliminating these elements, we approximate the Jacobian matrix with fewer stencils, thereby significantly reducing calculation time. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed simplification strategy improves computational efficiency while maintaining convergence rates comparable to those of the full Jacobian approach. Furthermore, the geometric multigrid method with a successive over-relaxation fast-sweeping smoother is employed for the linearized system to optimize performance. A variety of numerical experiments, including one-dimensional smooth subcritical flow, flows over a hump, and two-dimensional hydraulic jump over a wedge, are carried out to illustrate the third-order accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Tent transformed order $2$ nets and quasi-Monte Carlo rules with quadratic error decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of order $2$ digital nets for quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature of nonperiodic functions with bounded mixed second derivative over the cube. By using the so-called tent transform and its mapping properties we inherit error bounds from the periodic setting. Our analysis is based on decay properties of the multivariate Faber-Schauder coefficients of functions with bounded mixed second weak derivatives. As already observed by Hinrichs, Markhasin, Oettershagen, T. Ullrich (Numerische Mathematik 2016), order $2$ nets work particularly well on tensorized (periodic) Faber splines. From this we obtain a quadratic decay rate for tent transformed order $2$ nets also in the nonperiodic setting. This improves the formerly best known bound for this class of point sets by a factor of $\log N$.
  We back up our findings with numerical experiments, even suggesting that the bounds for order $2$ nets can be improved even further. This particularly indicates that point sets of lower complexity (compared to previously considered constructions) may already give (near) optimal error decay rates for quadrature of functions with second order mixed smoothness.</description>

      <title>Parametric Model Order Reduction by Box Clustering with Applications in Mechatronic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temperatures and structural deformations can compromise the functionality and reliability of new components for mechatronic systems. Therefore, high-fidelity simulations (HFS) are employed during the design process, as they enable a detailed analysis of the thermal and structural behavior of the system. However, such simulations are both computationally expensive and tedious, particularly during iterative optimization procedures. Establishing a parametric reduced order model (pROM) can accelerate the design's optimization if the model can accurately predict the behavior over a wide range of material and geometric properties. However, many existing methods exhibit limitations when applied to wide design ranges.
  In this work, we introduce the parametric Box Reduction (pBR) method, a matrix interpolation technique that minimizes the non-physical influence of training points due to the large parameter ranges. For this purpose, we define a new interpolation function that computes a local weight for each design variable and integrates them into the global function. Furthermore, we develop an intuitive clustering technique to select the training points for the model, avoiding numerical artifacts from distant points. Additionally, these two strategies do not require normalizing the parameter space and handle every property equally. The effectiveness of the pBR method is validated through two physical applications: structural deformation of a cantilever Timoshenko beam and heat transfer of a power module of a power converter. The results demonstrate that the pBR approach can accurately capture the behavior of mechatronic components across large parameter ranges without sacrificing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>General superconvergence for kernel-based approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel interpolation is a fundamental technique for approximating functions from scattered data, with a well-understood convergence theory when interpolating elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Beyond this classical setting, research has focused on two regimes: misspecified interpolation, where the kernel smoothness exceeds that of the target function, and superconvergence, where the target is smoother than the Hilbert space.
  This work addresses the latter, where smoother target functions yield improved convergence rates, and extends existing results by characterizing superconvergence for projections in general Hilbert spaces. We show that functions lying in ranges of certain operators, including adjoint of embeddings, exhibit accelerated convergence, which we extend across interpolation scales between these ranges and the full Hilbert space. In particular, we analyze Mercer operators and embeddings into $L_p$ spaces, linking the images of adjoint operators to Mercer power spaces. Applications to Sobolev spaces are discussed in detail, highlighting how superconvergence depends critically on boundary conditions. Our findings generalize and refine previous results, offering a broader framework for understanding and exploiting superconvergence. The results are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On Pseudospectral Concentration for Rank-1 Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudospectral analysis serves as a powerful tool in matrix computation and the study of both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. Among various numerical strategies, random sampling, especially in the form of rank-$1$ perturbations, offers a practical and computationally efficient approach. Moreover, due to invariance under unitary similarity, any complex matrix can be reduced to its upper triangular form, thereby simplifying the analysis. In this study. we develop a quantitative concentration theory for the pseudospectra of complex matrices under rank-$1$ random sampling perturbations, establishing a rigorous probabilistic framework for spectral characterization. First, for normal matrices, we derive a regular concentration inequality and demonstrate that the separation radius scales with the dimension as $\delta_d \sim 1/\sqrt{d}$. Next, for the equivalence class of nilpotent Jordan blocks, we exploit classical probabilistic tools, specifically, the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality and the Carbery-Wright anti-concentration inequality, to obtain singular concentration bounds, and demonstrate that the separation radius exhibits the same dimension-dependent scaling. This yields a singular pseudospectral concentration framework. Finally, observing that upper triangular Toeplitz matrices can be represented via the symbolic polynomials of nilpotent Jordan blocks, we employ partial fraction decomposition of rational functions to extend the singular framework to the equivalence class of upper triangular Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <title>Minimal dispersion on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal spherical cap dispersion ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ is the largest number $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ such that, no matter how $n$ points are distributed on the $d$-dimensional Euclidean unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, there is always a spherical cap with normalized area $\varepsilon$ not containing any of the points. We study the behavior of ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ as $n$ and $d$ grow to infinity. We develop connections to the problems of sphere covering and approximation of the Euclidean unit ball by inscribed polytopes. Existing and new results are presented in a unified way. Upper bounds on ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ result from choosing the points independently and uniformly at random and possibly adding some well-separated points to close large gaps. Moreover, we study dispersion with respect to intersections of caps.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Real-Time Data Analysis and Multiple Kernel Learning for Manufacturing of Innovative Steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implementation of thermally sprayed components in steel manufacturing presents challenges for production and plant maintenance. While enhancing performance through specialized surface properties, these components may encounter difficulties in meeting modified requirements due to standardization in the refurbishment process. This article proposes updating the established coating process for thermally spray coated components for steel manufacturing (TCCSM) by integrating real-time data analytics and predictive quality management. Two essential components--the data aggregator and the quality predictor--are designed through continuous process monitoring and the application of data-driven methodologies to meet the dynamic demands of the evolving steel landscape. The quality predictor is powered by the simple and effective multiple kernel learning strategy with the goal of realizing predictive quality. The data aggregator, designed with sensors, flow meters, and intelligent data processing for the thermal spray coating process, is proposed to facilitate real-time analytics. The performance of this combination was verified using small-scale tests that enabled not only the accurate prediction of coating quality based on the collected data but also proactive notification to the operator as soon as significant deviations are identified.</description>

      <title>Dual-Balancing for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11117v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new learning paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing the constraints of physical equations, boundary conditions (BCs), and initial conditions (ICs) into the loss function. Despite their successes, vanilla PINNs still suffer from poor accuracy and slow convergence due to the intractable multi-objective optimization issue. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN), which dynamically adjusts loss weights by integrating inter-balancing and intra-balancing to alleviate two imbalance issues in PINNs. Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance between PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an aggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies. Intra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in fitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting difficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the aggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its fitting difficulty level. We further introduce a robust weight update strategy to prevent abrupt spikes and arithmetic overflow in instantaneous weight values caused by large loss variances, enabling smooth weight updating and stable training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DB-PINN achieves significantly superior performance than those popular gradient-based weighting methods in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy.

      <title>Convergence of a finite volume scheme and dissipative measure-valued-strong stability for a hyperbolic-parabolic cross-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the development of a theoretical framework of global measure-valued solutions for a class of hyperbolic-parabolic cross-diffusion systems, and its application to the convergence analysis of a fully discrete finite-volume scheme. After introducing an appropriate notion of dissipative measure-valued solutions to the PDE system, a numerical scheme is proposed which is shown to generate, in the continuum limit, a dissipative measure-valued solution. The parabolic density part of the limiting measure-valued solution is atomic and converges to its constant state for long times. Furthermore, it is proved that whenever the PDE system possesses a strong solution, the convergence of the approximation scheme holds in the strong sense. The results are based on Young measure theory and a weak-strong stability estimate combining Shannon and Rao entropies. The convergence of the numerical scheme is achieved by means of discrete entropy dissipation inequalities and an artificial diffusion, which vanishes in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>The Essential Best and Average Rate of Convergence of the Exact Line Search Gradient Descent Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09140v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is very well known that when the exact line search gradient descent method is applied to a convex quadratic objective, the worst-case rate of convergence (ROC), among all seed vectors, deteriorates as the condition number of the Hessian of the objective grows. By an elegant analysis due to H. Akaike, it is generally believed -- but not proved -- that in the ill-conditioned regime the ROC for almost all initial vectors, and hence also the average ROC, is close to the worst case ROC. We complete Akaike's analysis by determining the \emph{essential best case ROC} (defined in a measure-theoretic way) by using a dynamical system approach, facilitated by the theorem of center and stable manifolds. Our analysis also makes apparent the effect of an intermediate eigenvalue in the Hessian by establishing the following amusing result: In the absence of an intermediate eigenvalue, the average ROC gets arbitrarily \emph{fast} -- not slow -- as the Hessian gets increasingly ill-conditioned.
  We discuss in passing some contemporary applications of exact line search GD to well-conditioned polynomial optimization problems arising from imaging and data sciences. In particular, we observe that a tailored exact line search GD algorithm for a POP arising from the phase retrieval problem is only 50\% more expensive per iteration than its constant step size counterpart, while promising a ROC only matched by the optimally tuned (constant) step size which can rarely be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>A robust and adaptive GenEO-type domain decomposition preconditioner for $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{curl})$ problems in three-dimensional general topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we design, analyse and test domain decomposition methods for linear systems of equations arising from conforming finite element discretisations of positive Maxwell-type equations, namely for $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{curl})$ problems. It is well known that convergence of domain decomposition methods rely heavily on the efficiency of the coarse space used in the second level. We design adaptive coarse spaces that complement a near-kernel space made from the gradient of scalar functions. The new class of preconditioner is inspired by the idea of subspace decomposition, but based on spectral coarse spaces, and is specially designed for curl-conforming discretisations of Maxwell's equations in heterogeneous media on general domains which may have holes. We also address the practical robustness of various solvers in the case of non-trivial topologies and/or high aspect ratio of the domain.</description>

      <title>Multilevel quadrature formulae for the optimal control of random PDEs</title>

Abstract: This manuscript presents a framework for using multilevel quadrature formulae to compute the solution of optimal control problems constrained by random partial differential equations. Our approach consists in solving a sequence of optimal control problems discretized with different levels of accuracy of the physical and probability discretizations. The final approximation of the control is then obtained in a postprocessing step, by suitably combining the adjoint variables computed on the different levels. We present a general convergence and complexity analysis for an unconstrained linear quadratic problem under abstract assumptions on the spatial discretization and on the quadrature formulae. We detail our framework for the specific case of a MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) quadrature formula, and numerical experiments confirm the better computational complexity of our MLMC approach compared to a standard Monte Carlo sample average approximation, even beyond the theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <title>An efficient Asymptotic-Preserving scheme for the Boltzmann mixture with disparate mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and implement an efficient asymptotic-preserving (AP) scheme to solve the gas mixture of Boltzmann equations under the disparate mass scaling relevant to the so-called "epochal relaxation" phenomenon. The disparity in molecular masses, ranging across several orders of magnitude, leads to significant challenges in both the evaluation of collision operators and the designing of time-stepping schemes to capture the multi-scale nature of the dynamics. A direct implementation of the spectral method faces prohibitive computational costs as the mass ratio increases due to the need to resolve vastly different thermal velocities. Unlike [I. M. Gamba, S. Jin, and L. Liu, Commun. Math. Sci., 17 (2019), pp. 1257-1289], we propose an alternative approach based on proper truncation of asymptotic expansions of the collision operators, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and works well for small $\varepsilon$. By incorporating the separation of three time scales in the model's relaxation process [P. Degond and B. Lucquin-Desreux, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 6 (1996), pp. 405-436], we design an AP scheme that captures the specific dynamics of the disparate mass model while maintaining computational efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in handling large mass ratios of heavy and light species, as well as capturing the epochal relaxation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Fully and semi-implicit robust space-time DG methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a stability and convergence analysis of a fully discrete scheme for the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations resulting from combining an $H(\mathrm{div}, \Omega)$-conforming discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization, and a discontinuous Galerkin time stepping scheme. Such a scheme is proven to be pressure robust and Reynolds semi-robust. Standard techniques can be used to analyze only the case of lowest-order approximations in time. Therefore, we use some nonstandard test functions to prove existence of discrete solutions, unconditional stability, and quasi-optimal convergence rates for any degree of approximation in time. In particular, a continuous dependence of the discrete solution on the data of the problem, and quasi-optimal convergence rates for low and high Reynolds numbers are proven in an energy norm including the term $L^{\infty}(0, T; L^2(\Omega)^d)$ for the velocity. In addition to the standard discontinuous Galerkin time stepping scheme, which is fully implicit, we propose and analyze a novel high-order semi-implicit version that avoids the need of solving nonlinear systems of equations after the first time slab, thus significantly improving the efficiency of the method. Some numerical experiments validating our theoretical results are presented.</description>

      <title>The Whitney method of fundamental solutions with Lusin wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation for a variant of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), where the source points $\{q_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ accumulate towards the domain in a Whitney fashion, meaning that their separation is proportional to the distance to the domain. We prove that the normalized Lusin wavelets $\psi_j(w) = b_j(w-q_j)^{-2}$ constitute a generalized basis, known as a frame, for the Hardy subspace of $L_2$-traces of holomorphic functions on the domain. Consequently, our method, where $\psi_j$ are used as basis functions in the MFS, enables a numerically stable approximation of solutions to Laplace boundary value problems, even when the solutions lack analytic continuation across the boundary. Despite the source points accumulating towards the domain, our computations achieve at least 12 digits of accuracy uniformly up to the boundary, including cases when the solution lacks analytic continuation or when the boundary has corners.</description>

      <title>A Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Miscible Displacement Problem Under Minimal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical method based on the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method in space and backward Euler in time is formulated and analyzed for solving the miscible displacement problem. Under low regularity assumptions, convergence is established by proving that, up to a subsequence, the discrete pressure, velocity and concentration converge to a weak solution as the mesh size and time step tend to zero. The analysis is based on several key features: an H(div) reconstruction of the velocity, the skew-symmetrization of the concentration equation, the introduction of an auxiliary variable and the definition of a new numerical flux. Numerical examples demonstrate optimal rates of convergence for smooth solutions, and convergence for problems of low regularity.</description>

      <title>High-Order Hermite Optimization: Fast and Exact Gradient Computation in Open-Loop Quantum Optimal Control using a Discrete Adjoint Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces the High-Order Hermite Optimization (HOHO) method, an open-loop discrete adjoint method for quantum optimal control. Our method is the first of its kind to efficiently compute exact (discrete) gradients when using continuous, parameterized control pulses while solving the forward equations (e.g. Schrodinger's equation or the Linblad master equation) with an arbitrarily high-order Hermite Runge-Kutta method. The HOHO method is implemented in QuantumGateDesign$.$jl (https://github.com/leespen1/QuantumGateDesign.jl), an open-source software package for the Julia programming language, which we use to perform numerical experiments comparing the method to Juqbox$.$jl (https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl). For realistic model problems we observe speedups up to 775x.</description>

      <title>Chordal-NMF with Riemannian Multiplicative Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is the problem of approximating a given nonnegative matrix M through the product of two nonnegative low-rank matrices W and H. Traditionally NMF is tackled by optimizing a specific objective function evaluating the quality of the approximation. This assessment is often done based on the Frobenius norm (F-norm). In this work, we argue that the F-norm, as the "point-to-point" distance, may not always be appropriate. Viewing from the perspective of cone, NMF may not naturally align with F-norm. So, a ray-to-ray chordal distance is proposed as an alternative way of measuring the quality of the approximation. As this measure corresponds to the Euclidean distance on the sphere, it motivates the use of manifold optimization techniques. We apply Riemannian optimization technique to solve chordal-NMF by casting it on a manifold. Unlike works on Riemannian optimization that require the manifold to be smooth, the nonnegativity in chordal-NMF defines a non-differentiable manifold. We propose a Riemannian Multiplicative Update (RMU), and showcase the effectiveness of the chordal-NMF on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>New Tight Wavelet Frame Constructions Sharing Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tight wavelet frames (TWFs) in \(L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)\) are versatile, and are practically useful due to their perfect reconstruction property. Nevertheless, existing TWF construction methods exhibit limitations, including a lack of specific methods for generating mother wavelets in extension-based construction, and the necessity to address the sum of squares (SOS) problem even when specific methods for generating mother wavelets are provided in SOS-based construction. Many TWF constructions begin with a given refinable function. However, this approach places the entire burden on finding suitable mother wavelets. In this paper, we introduce TWF construction methods that spread the burden between both types of functions: refinable functions and mother wavelets. These construction methods offer an alternative approach to addressing the SOS problem. We present examples to illustrate our construction methods.</description>

      <title>Approximation of arbitrarily high-order PDEs by first-order hyperbolic relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for constructing a first-order hyperbolic system whose solution approximates that of a desired higher-order evolution equation. Constructions of this kind have received increasing interest in recent years, and are potentially useful as either analytical or computational tools for understanding the corresponding higher-order equation. We perform a systematic analysis of a family of linear model equations and show that for each member of this family there is a stable hyperbolic approximation whose solution converges to that of the model equation in a certain limit. We then show through several examples that this approach can be applied successfully to a very wide range of nonlinear PDEs of practical interest.</description>

      <title>On the logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases. In particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the lowest logarithmic energy of the family.</description>

      <title>Damping Identification Sensitivity in Flutter Speed Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting flutter remains a key challenge in aeroelastic research, with certain models relying on modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and damping ratios. These models are particularly useful in early design stages or for the development of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (maximum take-off mass below 7 kg). This study evaluates two frequency-domain system identification methods, Fast Relaxed Vector Fitting (FRVF) and the Loewner Framework (LF), for predicting the flutter onset speed of a flexible wing model. Both methods are applied to extract modal parameters from Ground Vibration Testing data, which are subsequently used to develop a reduced-order model with two degrees of freedom. Results indicate that FRVF and LF-informed models provide reliable flutter speed, with predictions deviating by no more than 3% (FRVF) and 5% (LF) from the N4SID-informed benchmark. The findings highlight the sensitivity of flutter speed predictions to damping ratio identification accuracy and demonstrate the potential of these methods as computationally efficient alternatives for preliminary aeroelastic assessments.</description>
