      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of exciton diffusion near an electronic Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Fermi mixtures naturally appear in various physical systems. In semiconductor heterostructures, such mixtures can be realized, with bosons as excitons and fermions as dopant charges. However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges the comprehension of the mechanisms that determine physical properties such as mobility. In this study, we investigate interlayer exciton diffusion in an H-stacked WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer. Our measurements are performed in the dilute exciton density limit at low temperatures to examine how the presence of charges affects exciton mobility. Remarkably, for charge doping near the Mott insulator phase, we observe a giant enhancement of exciton diffusion of three orders of magnitude compared to charge neutrality. We attribute this observation to mobile valence holes, which experience a suppressed moir\'e potential due to the electronic charge order in the conduction band, and recombine with any conduction electron in a non-monogamous manner. This new mechanism emerges for sufficiently large fillings in the vicinity of correlated generalized Wigner crystal and Mott insulating states. Our results demonstrate the potential to characterize correlated electron states through exciton diffusion and provide insights into the rich interplay of bosons and fermions in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the charge transport in tilted chains on the choice of two-body interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tilted chains of spinless fermions in the presence of the nearest-neighbor density-density interaction for which the noninteracting counterpart displays Stark localization. We demonstrate that the latter two-body interaction can be decomposed into two (orthogonal) parts which, respectively, commute and do not commute with the single-particle Hamiltonian. We derive an explicit form of the noncommuting part that decreases with tilt and describes the nearest-neighbor correlated hopping and the pair-hopping interaction. When the density-density coupling is replaced by the pair-hopping interaction of the same magnitude then the charge dynamics may be faster by a few orders of magnitude than in the original model.</description>

      <title>Nematic correlations and nematic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in spin-1 kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematicity plays an important role in strongly correlated electron systems. We explore the spin nematicity for the spin-1 kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet with the bilinear-biquadratic model and the single-ion anisotropy using a generalized semi-classical approximation and Monte Carlo simulations. We reveal a rich ground state phase diagram, characterized by two main regions: a pure spin nematic phase, and a region featuring the coexistence of classical spin liquid and ferroicities for both dipolar and quadrupolar moments. The thermal fluctuation melts the spin nematic order into a critical phase with a quasi-long-range nematic order. Due to the fluctuating vortices of the spin nematic order, this critical phase further undergoes a nematic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a paramagnetic phase, marked by an anomalous stiffness jump. Additionally, the single-ion anisotropy leads to a weak ferromagnetism, resulting in a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at very low temperatures. Remarkably, this weak ferromagnetic regime is accompanied with the classical spin liquid behaviors. Our results provide an intriguing glimpse into the interplay between geometric frustration and intertwining spin orders with difference ranks, and are expected to stimulate further studies on the spin-1 systems and relevant materials.</description>

      <title>Classification of mass terms in kagome semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years, kagome materials received massive attention by virtue of being candidate hosts for a large variety of quantum phases: spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological phases of matter, to name the more exotic. One of the most interesting features is tunability: changing the filling, the non-interacting band structure can be tuned from flat bands to conventional metallic phases as well as to semimetals. In this paper we concentrate on the latter. At specific lattice filling the electronic bands have a semimetallic structure, hosting Dirac, massless quasiparticles, like in graphene or other layered two dimensional materials. Specifically, we determine what terms can be added to the nearest neighbor hopping that open at gap at said Dirac point. These terms can in principle arise through external perturbations, interactions or collective instabilities. We classify the sixteen possible gap-opening terms according to the broken symmetries. Furthermore, we identify concrete microscopic realisations allowing for an interpretation of these phases.</description>

      <title>Stripes, pair density wave, and holon Wigner crystal in single-band Hubbard model on diagonal square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the Hubbard model on wide diagonal square cylinders, rotated by $\pi/4$ relative to the regular lattice orientation. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.</description>

      <title>Electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a Weyl semimetal/spin ice interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic pyrochlore materials, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometrical frustration gives rise to exotic quantum phases, including topological semimetals and spin ice. While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7 and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a six-fold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice's field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal's topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a two-fold anisotropic response indicative of a new symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the nascent potential of complex quantum architectures in search of emergent phenomena unreachable in bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Stoner transitions beyond mean-field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously shown that the Stoner instability 2D has unconventional behavior: it is strongly first order but features a susceptibility which diverges at the transition point. Here, we analyze the Stoner transition for two-dimensional systems with spin and valley degrees of freedom, beyond mean field. At low density, we show that in one-valley and isotropic two-valley systems the leading effect beyond mean-field theory is suppression of the Stoner instability. In anisotropic two-valley systems, we show that, for larger anisotropy, the transition remains mean-field-like and retains its unconventional properties. We discuss applications to AlAs quantum wells.</description>

      <title>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Capping effects on spin and charge excitations in parent and superconducting Nd1-xSrxNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in infinite layer nickelates Nd1-xSrxNiO2 has so far been achieved only in thin films raising questions on the role of substrates and interfaces. Given the challenges associated with their synthesis it is imperative to identify their intrinsic properties. We use Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) to investigate the influence of the SrTiO3 capping layer on the excitations of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 (x = 0 and 0.2). Spin excitations are observed in parent and 20% doped Nd1-xSrxNiO2 regardless of capping, proving that magnetism is intrinsic to infinite-layer nickelates and appears in a significant fraction of their phase diagram. In parent and superconducting Nd1-xSrxNiO2, the spin excitations are slightly hardened in capped samples compared to the non-capped ones. Additionally, a weaker Ni - Nd charge transfer peak at ~ 0.6 eV suggests that the hybridization between Ni 3d and Nd 5d orbitals is reduced in capped samples. From our data, capping induces only minimal differences in Nd1-xSrxNiO2 and we phenomenologically discuss these differences based on the reconstruction of the SrTiO3 - NdNiO2 interface and other mechanisms such as crystalline disorder.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>

      <title>Record-large magnetically driven polarization in room temperature ferromagnets Os$X_2$ monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetically induced ferroelectrics in multiferroics provide an optimal approach to pursuit intrinsically strong magnetoelectricity. However, the complex antiferromagnetism, faint magnetically induced polarization, and low working temperatures make their magnetoelectric performance incompetent from the applications demands. Here, a family of two-dimensional $5d$ halides Os$X_2$ monolayers is predicted to be ferroelectric and ferromagnetic above room temperature. More interestingly, benefiting from the strong spin-orbital coupling and high-spin state of Os$^{2+}$ ion, the magnetically induced ferroelectric polarization can reach $5.9$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$, a record-large value in type-II multiferroics. The magnetoelectric effect, that is, controlling ferroelectric polarization by magnetic field has been demonstrated, and magnetically driven ferrovalley also emerges in this system. This work provides an effective way to solve the main defects of type-II multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Correlation between unconventional superconductivity and strange metallicity revealed by operando superfluid density measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strange-metal behavior has been observed in superconductors ranging from cuprates to pressurized nickelates, but its relationship to unconventional superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we perform operando superfluid density measurements on ion-gated FeSe films. We observe for the first time a synchronized evolution of superconducting condensate and the strange-metal phase with electron doping. A linear scaling between zero-temperature superfluid density and the strange-metal resistivity coefficient is further established, which nails down a direct link between the formation of superfluid in the superconducting state and the scattering of carriers in the strange-metal normal state. Remarkably, the scaling also applies for different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder. These findings indicate a fundamental principle governing superconducting condensation and strange-metal scattering in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermalization Dynamics in Closed Quantum Many Body Systems: a Precision Large Scale Exact Diagonalization Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a Krylov-subspace time evolution algorithm, we simulate the real-time dynamics of non-integrable finite spin rings to quite long times with high accuracy. We systematically study the finite-size deviation between the resulting equilibrium state and the thermal state, and we highlight the importance of the energy variance on the deviations. We find that the deviations are well described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and that the von Neumann entropy correction scaling is the square of the local operator scaling. We reveal also an area law contribution to the relaxed von Neumann entropy, which we connect to the mutual information between the considered subsystem and its immediate environment. We also find that local observables relax towards equilibrium exponentially with a relaxation time scale that grows linearly with system length and is somewhat independent of the local operator, but depends strongly on the energy of the initial state, with the fastest relaxation times found towards one end of the overall energy spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Super-moire materials represent a novel playground to engineer states of matter beyond the possibilities of conventional moire materials. However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moire materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moire materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moire structure to a many-body Hilbert space efficiently sampled with a tensor cross matrix product state method, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moire systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moire-of-moire systems and domain walls between different moire systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moire phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Information Geometry in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fluctuation-dissipation theorem in open quantum systems from an information-theoretic perspective. We define the fidelity susceptibility that measures the sensitivity of the systems under perturbation and relate it to the fidelity correlator that characterizes the correlation behaviors for mixed quantum states. In particular, we determine the scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility in the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SW-SSB) phase, strongly symmetric short-range correlated phase, and the quantum critical point between them. We then provide a geometric perspective of our construction using distance measures of density matrices. We find that the metric of the quantum information geometry generated by perturbative distance between density matrices before and after perturbation is generally non-analytic. Finally, we design a polynomial proxy that can in principle be used as an experimental probe for detecting the SW-SSB and phase transition through quantum metrology. In particular, we show that each term of the polynomial proxy is related to the R\'enyi versions of the fidelity correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.12126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study structurally-triggered metal-insulator transition in CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ by means of local density approximation (LDA) +$U$ and LDA+dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The ferrimagnetic insulating phase is essentially the same within both approaches. While LDA+$U$ describes the metal-insulator transition as a Peierls-like instability driven by Fermi surface nesting in the magnetically ordered phase, LDA+DMFT allows also the site-selective Mott transition without magnetic ordering as well as smooth crossover between the two pictures. We point out similarities and differences to rare-earth nickelates.</description>

      <title>Real space thermalization of locally driven quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of thermalization and its breakdown in isolated systems has led to a deeper understanding of non-equilibrium quantum states and their dependence on initial conditions. The role of initial conditions is prominently highlighted by the existence of quantum many-body scars, special athermal states with an underlying effective superspin structure, embedded in an otherwise chaotic many-body spectrum. Spin Heisenberg and $XXZ$ models and their variants in one and higher dimension have been shown to host exact quantum many-body scars, exhibiting perfect revivals of spin helix states that are realizable in synthetic and condensed matter systems. Motivated by these advances, we propose experimentally accessible, local, time-dependent protocols to explore the spatial thermalization profile and highlight how different parts of the system thermalize and affect the fate of the superspin. We identify distinct parametric regimes for the ferromagnetic ($X$-polarized) initial state based on the interplay between the driven spin and the rest, including local athermal behavior where the driven spin effectively decouples, acting like a ``cold" spot while being instrumental in heating up the other spins. We also identify parameter regimes where the superspin remains resilient to local driving for long time scales. We develop a real and Floquet space picture that explains our numerical observations, and make predictions that can be tested in various experimental setups.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>

Abstract: The electronic density of states, and, hence, the quasiparticle mass on the Fermi surface, is strongly enhanced through electronic correlations in quantum-critical metals. The nature of electronic correlations in such systems can be constrained by comparing different probes of the electronic density of states. Comparative studies in high-Tc superconductors present a significant challenge because of the masking effect of the superconducting phase. In contrast, the normal state can be readily accessed in the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn5, because the energy scale associated with superconductivity is small. Here we use thermal impedance spectroscopy to simultaneously access the electronic density of states in CeCoIn5 in two independent ways; via the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and via the electronic specific heat. We establish that the temperature- and magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate is determined entirely by the electronic density of states on the Fermi surface, where mass enhancement is cut off at high magnetic fields. Surprisingly, the specific heat reveals excess entropy in addition to that associated with the density of states on the Fermi surface. The electronic nature of this excess entropy is evidenced by its suppression in the superconducting state. We postulate that a second 'flavor' of boson generates the observed quantum critical physics beyond the mass renormalization on the Fermi surface in CeCoIn5, and suggest such a multi-flavor character for a broader range of quantum critical metals.</description>

Abstract: Few layers of graphene at small twist-angles have emerged as a fascinating platform for studying the problem of strong interactions in regimes with a nearly quenched single-particle kinetic energy and non-trivial band topology. Starting from the strong-coupling limit of twisted bilayer graphene with a vanishing single-electron bandwidth and interlayer-tunneling between the same sublattice sites, we present an {\it exact} analytical theory of the Coulomb interaction-induced low-energy optical spectral weight at all {\it integer} fillings. In this limit, while the interaction-induced single-particle dispersion is finite, the optical spectral weight vanishes identically at integer fillings. We study corrections to the optical spectral weight by systematically including the effects of experimentally relevant strain-induced renormalization of the single-electron bandwidth and interlayer tunnelings between the same sublattice sites. Given the relationship between the optical spectral weight and the diamagnetic response that controls superconducting $T_c$, our results highlight the relative importance of specific parent insulating phases in enhancing the tendency towards superconductivity when doped away from integer fillings.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetocaloric effect and phase separation induced by giant van Hove singularity in itinerant ferromagnetic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thermodynamic theory based on Landau grand potential expansion for ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transitions is developed for an electronic phase-separated state. It is rigorously shown that ferromagnetic phase involved in the phase-separated state exhibits negative magnetic susceptibility in the vicinity of~tricritical point. Thus, an entropy of the magnetically ordered phase may increase when the magnetic field is applied, which implies positive sign of the total magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ within magnetocaloric effect~(MCE). The electronic phase separation and MCE are considered within the Hubbard model for~face-centered cubic lattice with giant van Hove singularity of electron density of states at the band bottom. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation it is shown that such model of itinerant magnet exhibits the~first-order ferromagnet-paramagnet phase transition~(FOPT) with electronic phase separation and inverse magnetocaloric effect deep inside the phase-separated region. Temperature dependence of $\Delta S$ for the mean-field solution of the non-degenerate Hubbard model is analyzed in detail for different band filling values. The possibility to control $\Delta S$ sign by changing both temperature and band filling of magnetocaloric materials is demonstrated. This is important to interpret a lot of experimental data, possible technological applications, and further theoretical developments.</description>

Abstract: The effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the ground state properties of the square-lattice three-band Hubbard model with a single electron per site is studied by a generalized Hartree-Fock approximation. We calculate the full phase diagram and show that there appear additional orbital-entangled phases brought about by competition of various exchange channels or by the spin-orbit coupling in addition to conventional states stabilized by the Kugel-Khomskii mechanism. One of these phases previously proposed to explain magnetic properties of Sr$_2$VO$_4$ is characterized by vanishing dipolar magnetic moments and antiferro-octupolar ordering. We calculated microscopic parameters for this material and demonstrate that it is located near a phase boundary of two orbital-entangled and two conventional antiferromagnetic ferro-orbital states.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Electronic Landscape of Group-5 Transition Metal Ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta): Multiple Crystal Phases with Local Bonds and Flat Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group-5 transition metal ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta) are unique CdI$_2$-type layered materials that exhibit peculiar quasi-one-dimensional intralayer superstructures, known as ribbon-chains and butterfly-like clusters of $M$ atoms. In this review article, we attempt to systematically understand their electronic band structures based on our recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies and first-principles calculations. We underscore the role of the localized molecular-like orbital bonds that form the anomalous flat bands in the momentum space, and demonstrate how they influence the Fermi surface anisotropy, phase stabilities of crystal structures, and nontrivial topological properties in some cases. We also elaborate the future prospects for novel quantum phenomena that can be realized in these materials.</description>
