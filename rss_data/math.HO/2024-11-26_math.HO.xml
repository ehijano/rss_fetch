      <title>In 1955, Paul Lorenzen clears the sky in foundations of mathematics for Hermann Weyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1955, Paul Lorenzen is a mathematician who devotes all his research to foundations of mathematics, on a par with Hans Hermes, but his academic background is algebra in the tradition of Helmut Hasse and Wolfgang Krull. This shift from algebra to logic goes along with his discovery that his ``algebraic works [...] have been concerned with a problem that has formally the same structure as the problem of consistency of the classical calculus of logic'' (letter to Carl Friedrich Gethmann dated 14 January 1988). After having provided a proof of consistency for arithmetic in 1944 and published it in 1951, Lorenzen inquires still further into the foundations of mathematics and arrives at the conviction that analysis can also be given a predicative foundation. Wilhelm Ackermann as well as Paul Bernays have pointed out to him in 1947 that his views are very close to those proposed by Hermann Weyl in Das Kontinuum (1918): sets are not postulated to exist beforehand; they are being generated in an ongoing process of comprehension. This seems to be the reason for Lorenzen to get into contact with Weyl, who develops a genuine interest into Lorenzen's operative mathematics and welcomes with great enthusiasm his Einf{\"u}hrung in die operative Logik und Mathematik (1955), which he studies line by line. This book's aim is to grasp the objects of analysis by means of inductive definitions; the most famous achievement of this enterprise is a generalised inductive formulation of the Cantor-Bendixson theorem that makes it constructive. This mathematical kinship is brutally interrupted by Weyl's death in 1955; a planned visit by Lorenzen at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton takes place only in 1957--1958. As told by Kuno Lorenz, Lorenzen's first Ph.D. student, a discussion with Alfred Tarski during this visit provokes a turmoil in Lorenzen's operative research program that leads to his abandonment of language levels and to a great simplification of his presentation of analysis by distinguishing only between ``definite'' and ``indefinite'' quantifiers: the former govern domains for which a proof of consistency is available and secures the use of the law of excluded middle; the latter govern those for which there isn't, e.g. the real numbers. Lorenzen states in his foreword to Differential und Integral (1965) that he is faithful to Weyl's approach of Das Kontinuum in this simplification. This history motivates a number of mathematical and philosophical issues about predicative mathematics: how does Weyl's interest into Lorenzen's operative mathematics fit with his turn to Brouwer's intuitionism as expressed in ``{\"U}ber die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik'' (1921)? Why does Lorenzen turn away from his language levels and how does this turn relate to Weyl's conception of predicative mathematics? What do Lorenzen's conceptions of mathematics reveal about Weyl's conceptions?</description>

      <title>An introduction to Lorenzen's "Algebraic and logistic investigations on free lattices" (1951)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.06139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorenzen's ``Algebraische und logistische Untersuchungen \"uber freie Verb\"ande'' appeared in 1951 in The Journal of Symbolic Logic. These ``Investigations'' have immediately been recognised as a landmark in the history of infinitary proof theory. Their approach and method of proof have not been incorporated into the corpus of proof theory. Lorenzen proves the admissibility of cut by double induction, on the cut formula and on the complexity of the derivations, without using any ordinal assignment, contrary to the presentation of cut elimination in most standard texts on proof theory. We propose this introduction with the intent of giving a new impetus to their reception. The ``Investigations'' are best known for providing a constructive proof of consistency for ramified type theory without axiom of reducibility. They do so by showing that it is a part of a trivially consistent ``inductive calculus'' that describes our knowledge of arithmetic without detour. The proof resorts only to the inductive definition of formulas and theorems. They propose furthermore a definition of a semilattice, of a distributive lattice, of a pseudocomplemented semilattice, and of a countably complete boolean algebra as deductive calculuses, and show how to present them for constructing conservatively the respective free object over a given preordered set. They illustrate that lattice theory is a bridge between algebra and logic for which the construction of an element corresponds to a step in a proof. We shall describe the history of their reception, which focusses mainly on the omega-rule. The fruitfulness of this device is immediately recognised by Kurt Sch\"utte. It triggers the analysis by Ackermann (1951) of the infinitary inductive definition of the accessibility predicate with the goal of proving transfinite induction up to ordinal terms beyond epsilon_0, which is also taken over by Sch\"utte (1952).</description>
