      <title>R2D2 image reconstruction with model uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Production-level Fabrication of the Mid- and Ultra-High-Frequency Wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background instrumentation suite in the Atacama Desert of Chile. More than 65,000 polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers will be fielded in the frequency range spanning 27 to 280 GHz, with three separate dichroic designs. The mid-frequency 90/150 GHz and ultra-high-frequency 220/280 GHz detector arrays, fabricated at NIST, account for 39 of 49 total detector modules and implement the feedhorn-fed orthomode transducer (OMT)-coupled TES bolometer architecture. A robust production-level fabrication framework for these detector arrays and the monolithic DC/RF routing wafers has been developed, which includes single device prototyping, process monitoring techniques, in-process metrology, and cryogenic measurements of critical film properties. Application of this framework has resulted in timely delivery of nearly 100 total superconducting focal plane components to SO with 88% of detector wafers meeting nominal criteria for integration into a detector module: a channel yield &gt; 95% and Tc in the targeted range.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Deep Learning for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research note concerns the application of deep-learning-based multi-view-imaging techniques to data from the H.E.S.S. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope array. We find that the earlier the fusion of layer information from different views takes place in the neural network, the better our model performs with this data. Our analysis shows that the point in the network where the information from the different views is combined is far more important for the model performance than the method used to combine the information.</description>

      <title>Phasing segmented telescopes via deep learning methods: application to a deployable CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing high resolution imagery of the Earth's surface often calls for a telescope of considerable size, even from Low Earth Orbits (LEO). A large aperture often requires large and expensive platforms. For instance, achieving a resolution of 1m at visible wavelengths from LEO typically requires an aperture diameter of at least 30cm. Additionally, ensuring high revisit times often prompts the use of multiple satellites. In light of these challenges, a small, segmented, deployable CubeSat telescope was recently proposed creating the additional need of phasing the telescope's mirrors. Phasing methods on compact platforms are constrained by the limited volume and power available, excluding solutions that rely on dedicated hardware or demand substantial computational resources. Neural Network (NN) are known for their computationally efficient inference and reduced on board requirements. Therefore we developed a NN based method to measure co phasing errors inherent to a deployable telescope. The proposed technique demonstrates its ability to detect phasing error at the targeted performance level (typically a wavefront error (WFE) below 15 nm RMS for a visible imager operating at the diffraction limit) using a point source. The robustness of the NN method is verified in presence of high order aberrations or noise and the results are compared against existing state of the art techniques. The developed NN model ensures its feasibility and provides a realistic pathway towards achieving diffraction limited images.</description>

      <title>Achieving Quantum Limits of Exoplanet Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is fundamentally impeded by the high dynamic range between the star and the planet. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet signatures by optically rejecting light from the host star while leaving light from the exoplanet mostly unaltered. However it is unclear whether coronagraphs constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant exoplanet discovery. In this work, we report the quantum information limits of exoplanet detection and localization specified by the Quantum Chernoff Exponent (QCE) and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) respectively. In view of these quantum limits, we assess and compare several high-performance coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve total rejection of an on-axis point source. We find that systems which exclusively eliminate the fundamental mode of the telescope without attenuating higher-order orthogonal modes are quantum-optimal in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Importantly, the QFIM is shown to persist well below the diffraction-limit of the telescope, suggesting that quantum-optimal coronagraphs may further expand the domain of accessible exoplanets.</description>

      <title>A Universe of Sound: Processing NASA Data into Sonifications to Explore Participant Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, astronomy has prioritized visuals to present information, with scientists and communicators overlooking the critical need to communicate astrophysics with blind or low-vision audiences and provide novel channels for sighted audiences to process scientific information. This study sonified NASA data of three astronomical objects presented as aural visualizations, then surveyed blind or low-vision and sighted individuals to elicit feedback on the experience of these pieces as it relates to enjoyment, education, and trust of the scientific data. Data analyses from 3,184 sighted or blind or low-vision survey participants yielded significant self-reported learning gains and positive experiential responses. Results showed that astrophysical data engaging multiple senses could establish additional avenues of trust, increase access, and promote awareness of accessibility in sighted and blind or low-vision communities.</description>

      <title>Dust Extinction Measures for $z\sim 8$ Galaxies using Machine Learning on JWST Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a machine learning study to measure the dust content of galaxies observed with JWST at z &gt; 6 through the use of trained neural networks based on high-resolution IllustrisTNG simulations. Dust is an important unknown in the evolution and observability of distant galaxies and is degenerate with other stellar population features through spectral energy fitting. As such, we develop and test a new SED-independent machine learning method to predict dust attenuation and sSFR of high redshift (z &gt; 6) galaxies. Simulated galaxies were constructed using the IllustrisTNG model, with a variety of dust contents parameterized by E(B-V) and A(V) values, then used to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using supervised learning through a regression model. We demonstrate that within the context of these simulations, our single and multi-band models are able to predict dust content of distant galaxies to within a 1$\sigma$ dispersion of A(V) $\sim 0.1$. Applied to spectroscopically confirmed z &gt; 6 galaxies from the JADES and CEERS programs, our models predicted attenuation values of A(V) &lt; 0.7 for all systems, with a low average (A(V) = 0.28). Our CNN predictions show larger dust attenuation but lower amounts of star formation compared to SED fitted values. Both results show that distant galaxies with confirmed spectroscopy are not extremely dusty, although this sample is potentially significantly biased. We discuss these issues and present ideas on how to accurately measure dust features at the highest redshifts using a combination of machine learning and SED fitting.</description>

      <title>Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 1: identifying the rate-limiting physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple nations are planning activity on the Moon's surface, and to deconflict lunar operations we must understand the sandblasting damage from rocket exhaust blowing soil. Prior research disagreed over the scaling of the erosion rate, which determines the magnitude of the damage. Reduced gravity experiments and two other lines of evidence now indicate that the erosion rate scales with the kinetic energy flux at the bottom of the laminar sublayer of the gas. Because the rocket exhaust is so fast, eroded particles lifted higher in the boundary layer do not impact the surface for kilometers (if at all; some leave the Moon entirely), so there is no saltation in the vicinity of the gas. As a result, there is little transport of gas kinetic energy from higher in the boundary layer down to the surface, so the emission of soil into the gas is a surprisingly low energy process. In low lunar gravity, a dominant source of resistance to this small energy flux turns out to be the cohesive energy density of the lunar soil, which arises primarily from particles in the 0.3 to 3 micron size range. These particles constitute only a tiny fraction of the mass of lunar soil and have been largely ignored in most studies, so they are poorly characterized.</description>

      <title>Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 2: benchmarking and predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the companion paper ("Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 1: identifying the rate-limiting physics", this issue) an equation was developed for the rate that lunar soil erodes under the exhaust of a landing rocket. That equation has only one parameter that is not calibrated from first principles, so here it is calibrated by the blowing soil's optical density curve during an Apollo landing. An excellent fit is obtained, helping validate the equation. However, when extrapolating the erosion rate all the way to touchdown on the lunar surface, a soil model is needed to handle the increased resistance to erosion as the deeper, more compacted soil is exposed. Relying on models derived from Apollo measurements and from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner thermal inertia measurements, only one additional soil parameter is unknown: the scale of increasing cohesive energy with soil compaction. Treating this as an additional fitting parameter results in some degeneracy in the solutions, but the depth of erosion scour in the post-landing imagery provides an additional constraint on the solution. The results show that about 4 to 10 times more soil was blown in each Apollo landing than previously believed, so the potential for sandblasting damage is worse than prior estimates. This also shows that, with further development, instruments to measure the soil erosion during lunar landings can constrain the soil column's density profile complementary to the thermal inertia measurements, providing insight into the landing site's geology.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning pipeline for real-time detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of multi-messenger astronomy relies on the rapid detection of gravitational waves at very low latencies ($\mathcal{O}$(1\,s)) in order to maximize the amount of time available for follow-up observations. In recent years, neural-networks have demonstrated robust non-linear modeling capabilities and millisecond-scale inference at a comparatively small computational footprint, making them an attractive family of algorithms in this context. However, integration of these algorithms into the gravitational-wave astrophysics research ecosystem has proven non-trivial. Here, we present the first fully machine learning-based pipeline for the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) running in low-latency. We demonstrate this pipeline to have a fraction of the latency of traditional matched filtering search pipelines while achieving state-of-the-art sensitivity to higher-mass stellar binary black holes.</description>

      <title>A VLBI Software Correlator for Fast Radio Transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One major goal in fast radio burst science is to detect fast radio bursts (FRBs) over a wide field of view without sacrificing the angular resolution required to pinpoint them to their host galaxies. Wide-field detection and localization capabilities have already been demonstrated using connected-element interferometry; the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will push this further using widefield cylindrical telescopes as widefield outriggers for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). This paper describes an offline VLBI software correlator written in Python for the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project. It includes features well-suited to modern widefield instruments like multibeaming/multiple phase center correlation, pulse gating including coherent dedispersion, and a novel correlation algorithm based on the quadratic estimator formalism. This algorithm mitigates sensitivity loss which arises in instruments where the windowing and channelization is done outside the VLBI correlator at each station, which accounts for a 30 percent sensitivity drop away from the phase center. Our correlation algorithm recovers this sensitivity on both simulated and real data. As an end to end check of our software, we have written a preliminary pipeline for VLBI calibration and single-pulse localization, which we use in Lanman et al. (2024) to verify the astrometric accuracy of the CHIME/FRB Outriggers array.</description>

      <title>Directional detection of keV proton and carbon recoils with MIMAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directional detection is the dedicated strategy to demonstrate that DM-like signals measured by direct detectors are indeed produced by DM particles from the galactic halo. The experimental challenge of measuring the direction of DM-induced nuclear recoils with (sub-)millimeter tracks has limited, so far, the maximal directional reach to DM masses around $100~\rm{GeV}$. In this paper, we expose the MIMAC detector to three different neutron fields and we develop a method to reconstruct the direction of the neutron-induced nuclear recoils. We measure an angular resolution better than $16^\circ$ for proton recoils down to a kinetic energy of $4~\rm{keV}$ and for carbon recoils down to a kinetic energy of $5.5~\rm{keV}$. For the first time, a detector achieves the directional measurement of proton and carbon recoils with kinetic energies in the keV range without any restriction on the direction of the incoming particle. This work demonstrates that directional detection is around the corner for probing DM with masses down to $\mathcal{O}(1~\rm{GeV})$.</description>
