      <title>Dynamics of Droplets Moving on Lubricated Polymer Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of drops on polymer-coated surfaces is crucial for optimizing applications such as self-cleaning materials or microfluidic devices. While the static and dynamic properties of deposited drops have been well characterised, a microscopic understanding of the underlying dynamics is missing. In particular, it is unclear how drop dynamics depends on the amount of uncrosslinked chains in the brush, because experimental techniques fail to quantify those. Here we use coarse-grained simulations to study droplets moving on a lubricated polymer brush substrate under the influence of an external body force. The simulation model is based on the many body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) method and designed to mimic a system of water droplets on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes with chemically identical PDMS lubricant. In agreement with experiments, we find a sublinear power law dependence between the external force $F$ and the droplet velocity $v$, $F \propto v^\alpha$ with $\alpha &lt;1$; however, the exponents differ ($\alpha \sim 0.6-0.7$ in simulations versus $\alpha \sim 0.25$ in experiments). With increasing velocity, the droplets elongate and the receding contact angle decreases, whereas the advancing contact angle remains roughly constant. Analyzing the flow profiles inside the droplet reveals that the droplets do not slide, but roll, with vanishing slip at the substrate surface. Surprisingly, adding lubricant has very little effect on the effective friction force between the droplet and the substrate, even though it has a pronounced effect on the size and structure of the wetting ridge, especially above the cloaking transition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Kinematics of Recursive Origami Inspired by Spidron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-periodic folding of periodic crease patterns paves the way to novel nonlinear phenomena that cannot be feasible through periodic folding. This paper focuses on the non-periodic folding of recursive crease patterns generalized from Spidron. Although it is known that Spidron has a 1-DOF isotropic rigid folding motion, its general kinematics and dependence on the crease pattern remain unclear. Using the kinematics of a single unit cell of Spidron and the recursive construction of the folded state of multiple unit cells, we consider the folding of Spidron that is not necessarily isotropic. We found that as the number of unit cells increases, the non-periodic folding is restricted and the isotropic folding becomes dominant. Then, we analyze the three kinds of isotropic folding modes by constructing 1-dimensional dynamical systems governing each of them. We show that the dynamical system can possess different recursive natures depending on folding modes even in an identical crease pattern. Furthermore, we show their novel nonlinear nature, including the period-doubling cascade leading to the emergence of chaos.</description>

      <title>The elastic stored energy of initially strained, or stressed, materials: restrictions and third-order expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large variety of materials, widely encountered both in engineering applications and in the biological realm, are characterised by a non-vanishing internal stress distribution, even in the absence of external deformations or applied forces. These initial stresses are due to initial strains or microstructural changes, such as thermal expansion, manufacturing processes, volumetric growth, remodelling, etc. A common constitutive choice for modelling such materials extends the classical approach in the field theory of continuum mechanics to include, explicitly, the initial stress or strain in the elastic stored energy function. Here, we discuss why these energy functions need to satisfy some restrictions to avoid unphysical behaviours, such as non-conservation of energy, {and we derive the required restrictions from the classical assumptions of elasticity.} To illustrate their need, we perform a rigorous asymptotic expansion for proving that these restrictions on stored energy functions that depend on the strain and initial stress are required for consistency with strain energy functions of classical third-order weakly nonlinear elasticity.</description>

      <title>A device for studying elementary plasticity fluctuations in granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we describe a scientific device specifically designed for the study of the plasticity fluctuations preceding the fracture of granular media. Biaxial tests on model granular media are performed using a commercial uniaxial loading system. Strain field fluctuations are measured using a method based on the interference of coherent light scattered by the sample. We show that such a device enables discrete plasticity events to be unambiguously evidenced. Moreover, those discrete plasticity fluctuations depend only on the imposed strain, and not on the strain rate.</description>

      <title>Vortex pattern stabilization in thin films resulting from shear thickening of active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for structuring on micrometer scales is abundant, for example, in view of phononic applications. We here outline a novel approach based on the phenomenon of active turbulence on the mesoscale. As we demonstrate, a shear-thickening carrier fluid of active microswimmers intrinsically stabilizes regular vortex patterns of otherwise turbulent active suspensions. The fluid self-organizes into a periodically structured nonequilibrium state. Introducing additional passive particles of intermediate size leads to regular spatial organization of these objects. Our approach opens a new path towards functionalization through patterning of thin films and membranes.</description>

      <title>Morphological instability at topological defects in a three-dimensional vertex model for spherical epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are a central building block of complex organisms. Topological defects have emerged as important elements for single cell behavior in flat epithelia. Here we theoretically study such defects in a three-dimensional vertex model for spherical epithelia like cysts or intestinal organoids. We find that they lead to the same generic morphological instability to an icosahedral shape as it is known from spherical elastic shells like virus capsids, polymerized vesicles or buckyballs. We derive analytical expressions for the effective stretching and bending moduli as a function of the parameters of the vertex model, in excellent agreement with computer simulations. These equations accurately predict both the buckling of a flat epithelial monolayer under uniaxial compression and the faceting transition around the topological defects in spherical epithelia. We further show that localized apico-basal tension asymmetries allow them to reduce the transition threshold to small system sizes.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction for transient coupled diffusion-deformation of hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a reduced-order model (ROM) for analyzing the transient diffusion-deformation of hydrogels. The full-order model (FOM) describing hydrogel transient behavior consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in which chemical potential and displacements are coupled. This system is formulated in a monolithic fashion and solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The ROM employs proper orthogonal decomposition as a model order reduction approach. We test the ROM performance through benchmark tests on hydrogel swelling behavior and a case study simulating co-axial printing. Finally, we embed the ROM into an optimization problem to identify the model material parameters of the coupled problem using full-field data. We verify that the ROM can predict hydrogels' diffusion-deformation evolution and material properties, significantly reducing computation time compared to the FOM. The results demonstrate the ROM's accuracy and computational efficiency. This work paths the way towards advanced practical applications of ROMs, e.g., in the context of feedback error control in hydrogel 3D printing.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of transient finite-strain coupled diffusion-deformation theories for hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comparative review and classification between some well-known thermodynamically consistent models of hydrogel behavior in a large deformation setting, specifically focusing on solvent absorption/desorption and its impact on mechanical deformation and network swelling. The proposed discussion addresses formulation aspects, general mathematical classification of the governing equations, and numerical implementation issues based on the finite element method. The theories are presented in a unified framework demonstrating that, despite not being evident in some cases, all of them follow equivalent thermodynamic arguments. A detailed numerical analysis is carried out where Taylor-Hood elements are employed in the spatial discretization to satisfy the inf-sup condition and to prevent spurious numerical oscillations. The resulting discrete problems are solved using the FEniCS platform through consistent variational formulations, employing both monolithic and staggered approaches. We conduct benchmark tests on various hydrogel structures, demonstrating that major differences arise from the chosen volumetric response of the hydrogel. The significance of this choice is frequently underestimated in the state-of-the-art literature but has been shown to have substantial implications on the resulting hydrogel behavior.</description>

      <title>Relative Resolution: An Analysis with the Kullback-Leibler Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel type of a multiscale approach, called Relative Resolution (RelRes), can correctly retrieve the behavior of various nonpolar liquids, whilst speeding up molecular simulations by almost an order of magnitude. In this approach in a single system, molecules switch their resolution in terms of their relative separation, with near neighbors interacting via fine-grained potentials yet far neighbors interacting via coarse-grained potentials; notably, these two potentials are analytically parameterized by a multipole approximation. Our current work focuses on analyzing RelRes by relating it with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Entropy, which is a useful metric for multiscale errors. In particular, we thoroughly examine the exact and approximate versions of this informatic measure for several alkane systems. By analyzing its dependency on the system size, we devise a formula for predicting the exact KL Entropy of an "infinite" system via the computation of the approximate KL Entropy of an "infinitesimal" system. Demonstrating that the KL Entropy can holistically capture many multiscale errors, we settle bounds for the KL Entropy that ensure a sufficient representation of the structural and thermal behavior by the RelRes algorithm. This, in turn, allows the scientific community for readily determining the ideal switching distance for an arbitrary RelRes system.</description>

      <title>Self-enhanced mobility enables vortex pattern formation in living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergence of regular spatial patterns is a hallmark in living matter ranging from subcellular organelles to developing embryos and to ecosystems. Mechanisms for the formation of ordered spatial patterns in biology often require chemical signaling that coordinates cellular behavior and differentiation. Here we discovered a novel route to large-scale regular pattern formation in living matter mediated by purely physical interactions. We found that dense bacterial living matter spontaneously developed an ordered lattice of mesoscale, fast-spinning vortices each consisting of ~10^4-10^5 motile cells; these mesoscale vortices were arranged in space over centimeter scale with apparent hexagonal order, while individual cells in the vortices moved in coordinated directions with strong polar and vortical order. Single-cell tracking and numerical simulations suggest that the phenomenon is enabled by self-enhanced mobility of individual cells in the system. Our findings demonstrate a simple physical mechanism for self-organized pattern formation in living systems and more generally, in other active matter systems near the boundary of fluidlike and solidlike behaviors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced contact flexibility from nanoparticles in capillary suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Sample-spanning particle networks are used to induce structure and a yield stress, necessary for 3D printing of porous ceramics and paints. In capillary suspensions, a small quantity of immiscible secondary fluid is incorporated into a suspension. By further adding nanoparticles with a range of hydrophobicities, the structure of the bridges and microparticle-microparticle contacts should be modified, resulting in a tunable yield stress and shear moduli. Moreover, the compressibility of these samples, important in many processing and application steps, should be sensitive to these changes.
  Experiment: The nanoparticle hydrophobicity was altered and their position relative to the microparticles and the bridges was examined using confocal microscopy where the correlation between bridge size and network structure was observed. A step-wise uniaxial compression test on the confocal was conducted to monitor the microparticle movement and structural changes between capillary suspension networks with and without nanoparticles.
  Findings: Our observation suggests that nanoparticles induce the formation of thin liquid films on the surface of the microparticles, mitigating contact line pinning and promoting internal liquid exchange. Additionally, nanoparticles at microparticle contact regions further diminish Hertzian contact, enhancing the capacity for rearrangement. These effects enhance microparticle movement, narrowing the bridge size distribution.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for a buckled elastic filament in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the three-dimensional buckling of an elastic filament in a shear flow of a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number and high Peclet number. We apply the Euler-Bernoulli beam (elastica) theoretical model. We show the universal character of the full 3D spectral problem for the small perturbation of the thin filament from a straight position of arbitrary orientation. We use the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the linearized elastica equation in the shear plane, found earlier by [Liu et al., 2024] with the Chebyshev spectral collocation method, to solve the full 3D eigenproblem. We provide a simple analytic approximation to the eigenfunctions, represented as Gaussian wavepackets. As the main result of the paper, we derive square-root dependence of the eigenfunction wavenumber on the parameter $\tilde{\chi}=-\eta \sin 2\phi \sin^2\theta$, where $\eta$ is the elastoviscous number, and the filament orientation is determined by the zenith angle $\theta$ with respect to the vorticity direction and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ relative to the flow direction. We also compare the eigenfunctions with shapes of slightly buckled elastic filaments with a non-negligible thickness with the same Young's modulus, using the bead model and performing numerical simulations with the precise Hydromultipole numerical codes.</description>
