      <title>Floquet scattering of shallow water waves by a vertically oscillating plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the scattering of a plane wave from a vertically oscillating plate in the low frequency approximation by means of Floquet theory. In the case of a static plate, the scattering coefficients are evaluated via mode matching method for the full two-dimensional linearised water wave problem and are compared with the coefficients obtained from a reduced one-dimensional model in the shallow water approximation. The main part of the analysis is the extension of this 1D shallow water approximation to the case of a vertically oscillating plate, where time modulation is only encapsulated in the blockage coefficient. We show that the incident wave is scattered into Floquet sidebands and extract the scattering coefficients for each harmonic using a Floquet scattering formalism. Finally, considering a slowly oscillating plate, we propose a quasistatic approximation which appears to be particularly accurate.</description>

      <title>Alternative sum rules and waterbed effects of Lorentz resonator system for sound absorption and transmission in a unidimensional waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fundamental constraints on passive linear time-invariant acoustic systems through the developing alternative linear sum rules for sound absorption and transmission. Our approach, based on the Herglotz function method, yields integral identities without non-linear logarithmic terms or frequency weightings, providing clearer physical insights into system performance limits. The study focuses on unidimensional waveguides with Lorentz resonators, encompassing various practical acoustic structures. The developed sum rules are found to be particularly effective in predicting constraints on the average sound absorption coefficient for broadband absorbers operating in deep-subwavelength structures. Based on these rules, we demonstrate the waterbed effect in such systems, highlighting the inherent compromises between absorption efficiency, bandwidth, and device thickness. Through case studies of resonator arrays and membranes, we illustrate the practical implications of these new sum rules for designing optimal sound absorbers and isolators. The work concludes with a discussion on the challenges and future prospects in passive noise control, suggesting potential pathways to surpass current performance boundaries.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rolling on a 90 degree incline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On perfectly vertical surfaces, rolling is conventionally deemed impossible without external torque. While various species like geckos and spiders exhibit vertical locomotion, they cannot achieve rolling; instead, they fall. In this study, we demonstrate the spontaneous rolling of an elastic polyacrylamide sphere on an elastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate held vertically at a 90 degree incline, given specific elasticity values for the materials. Our experiments uncover a slow rolling motion induced by a dynamically changing contact diameter and a unique contact asymmetry. The advancing edge behaves like a closing crack, while the receding edge acts as an opening crack. Utilizing adhesion hysteresis theories and crack propagation models, we explain how this contact asymmetry generates the necessary torque and friction to maintain rolling, preventing either pinning or falling. The findings challenge the traditional understanding of vertical surface interactions and open new avenues for exploring soft-on-soft contact systems. This novel phenomenon has potential implications for designing advanced materials and understanding biological locomotion on vertical surfaces.</description>

      <title>Fracture and size effect in mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resort to variational methods to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of fine metamaterials as a function of cell size. To zeroth order, the metamaterial behaves as a micropolar continuum with both displacement and rotation degrees of freedom, but exhibits linear-elastic fracture mechanics scaling and therefore no size effect. To higher order, the overall energetics of the metastructure can be characterized explicitly in terms of the solution of the zeroth-order continuum problem by the method of {\Gamma}-expansion. We present explicit expressions of the second-order correction for octet frames. As an application, we evaluate the compliance of double-cantilever octet specimens to second order and use the result to elucidate the dependence of the apparent toughness of the specimen on cell size. The analysis predicts the discreteness of the metamaterial lattice to effectively shield the crack-tip, a mechanism that we term lattice shielding. The theory specifically predicts anti-shielding, i. e., coarser is weaker, in agreement with recent experimental observations.</description>
