      <title>A Preliminary Study on Accelerating Simulation Optimization with GPU Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a preliminary study on utilizing GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to accelerate computation for three simulation optimization tasks with either first-order or second-order algorithms. Compared to the implementation using only CPU (Central Processing Unit), the GPU implementation benefits from computational advantages of parallel processing for large-scale matrices and vectors operations. Numerical experiments demonstrate computational advantages of utilizing GPU implementation in simulation optimization problems, and show that such advantage comparatively further increase as the problem scale increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare. In this context, the TRUSTroke project aims to leverage FL to assist clinicians in ischemic stroke prediction. This paper provides an overview of the TRUSTroke FL network infrastructure. The proposed architecture adopts a client-server model with a central Parameter Server (PS). We introduce a Docker-based design for the client nodes, offering a flexible solution for implementing FL processes in clinical settings. The impact of different communication protocols (HTTP or MQTT) on FL network operation is analyzed, with MQTT selected for its suitability in FL scenarios. A control plane to support the main operations required by FL processes is also proposed. The paper concludes with an analysis of security aspects of the FL architecture, addressing potential threats and proposing mitigation strategies to increase the trustworthiness level.</description>

      <title>Araucaria: Simplifying INC Fault Tolerance with High-Level Intents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network programmability allows modification of fine-grain data plane functionality. The performance benefits of data plane programmability have motivated many researchers to offload computation that previously operated only on servers to the network, creating the notion of in-network computing (INC). Because failures can occur in the data plane, fault tolerance mechanisms are essential for INC. However, INC operators and developers must manually set fault tolerance requirements using domain knowledge to change the source code. These manually set requirements may take time and lead to errors in case of misconfiguration. In this work, we present Araucaria, a system that aims to simplify the definition and implementation of fault tolerance requirements for INC. The system allows requirements specification using an intent language, which enables the expression of consistency and availability requirements in a constrained natural language. A refinement process translates the intent and incorporates the essential building blocks and configurations into the INC code. We present a prototype of Araucaria and analyze the end-to-end system behavior. Experiments demonstrate that the refinement scales to multiple intents and that the system provides fault tolerance with negligible overhead in failure scenarios.</description>

      <title>Simulating Cloud Environments of Connected Vehicles for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of connected vehicles is driven by increasing customer and regulatory demands. To meet these, more complex software applications, some of which require service-based cloud and edge backends, are developed. When new software is deployed however, the high complexity and interdependencies between components can lead to unforeseen side effects in other system parts. As such, it becomes more challenging to recognize whether deviations to the intended system behavior are occurring, ultimately resulting in higher monitoring efforts and slower responses to errors. To overcome this problem, a simulation of the cloud environment running in parallel to the system is proposed. This approach enables the live comparison between simulated and real cloud behavior. Therefore, a concept is developed mirroring the existing cloud system into a simulation. To collect the necessary data, an observability platform is presented, capturing telemetry and architecture information. Subsequently, a simulation environment is designed that converts the architecture into a simulation model and simulates its dynamic workload by utilizing captured communication data. The proposed concept is evaluated in a real-world application scenario for electric vehicle charging: Vehicles can apply for an unoccupied charging station at a cloud service backend, the latter which manages all incoming requests and performs the assignment. Benchmarks are conducted by comparing the collected telemetry data with the simulated results under different loads and injected faults. The results show that regular cloud behavior is mirrored well by the simulation and that misbehavior due to fault injection is well visible, indicating that simulations are a promising data source for anomaly detection in connected vehicle cloud environments during operation.</description>

      <title>HyDiscGAN: A Hybrid Distributed cGAN for Audio-Visual Privacy Preservation in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify speakers' sentiment tendencies in multimodal video content, raising serious concerns about privacy risks associated with multimodal data, such as voiceprints and facial images. Recent distributed collaborative learning has been verified as an effective paradigm for privacy preservation in multimodal tasks. However, they often overlook the privacy distinctions among different modalities, struggling to strike a balance between performance and privacy preservation. Consequently, it poses an intriguing question of maximizing multimodal utilization to improve performance while simultaneously protecting necessary modalities. This paper forms the first attempt at modality-specified (i.e., audio and visual) privacy preservation in MSA tasks. We propose a novel Hybrid Distributed cross-modality cGAN framework (HyDiscGAN), which learns multimodality alignment to generate fake audio and visual features conditioned on shareable de-identified textual data. The objective is to leverage the fake features to approximate real audio and visual content to guarantee privacy preservation while effectively enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show that compared with the state-of-the-art MSA model, HyDiscGAN can achieve superior or competitive performance while preserving privacy.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Orchestration of Energy-Efficient Gossip Learning Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully distributed learning schemes such as Gossip Learning (GL) are gaining momentum due to their scalability and effectiveness even in dynamic settings. However, they often imply a high utilization of communication and computing resources, whose energy footprint may jeopardize the learning process, particularly on battery-operated IoT devices. To address this issue, we present Optimized Gossip Learning (OGL)}, a distributed training approach based on the combination of GL with adaptive optimization of the learning process, which allows for achieving a target accuracy while minimizing the energy consumption of the learning process. We propose a data-driven approach to OGL management that relies on optimizing in real-time for each node the number of training epochs and the choice of which model to exchange with neighbors based on patterns of node contacts, models' quality, and available resources at each node. Our approach employs a DNN model for dynamic tuning of the aforementioned parameters, trained by an infrastructure-based orchestrator function. We performed our assessments on two different datasets, leveraging time-varying random graphs and a measurement-based dynamic urban scenario. Results suggest that our approach is highly efficient and effective in a broad spectrum of network scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the contemporary era, biodiversity conservation emerges as a paramount challenge, necessitating innovative approaches to monitoring, preserving, and enhancing the natural world. This paper explores the integration of blockchain technology in biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger and tokenization affordances, presents a groundbreaking solution for the accurate monitoring and tracking of environmental assets, thereby addressing the critical need for transparency and trust in conservation efforts. Unlike previous more theoretical approaches, by addressing the research question of how blockchain supports digital resilience in biodiversity conservation, this study presents a grounded framework that justifies which blockchain features are essential to decipher specific data contribution and data leveraging processes in an effort to protect our planet's biodiversity, while boosting potential economic benefits for all actors involved, from local farmers, to hardware vendors and artificial intelligence experts, to investors and regular users, volunteers and donors.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Sequential Federated Learning for Non-IID Data by Enhancing Local Model Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional federated learning mainly focuses on parallel settings (PFL), which can suffer significant communication and computation costs. In contrast, one-shot and sequential federated learning (SFL) have emerged as innovative paradigms to alleviate these costs. However, the issue of non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data persists as a significant challenge in one-shot and SFL settings, exacerbated by the restricted communication between clients. In this paper, we improve the one-shot sequential federated learning for non-IID data by proposing a local model diversity-enhancing strategy. Specifically, to leverage the potential of local model diversity for improving model performance, we introduce a local model pool for each client that comprises diverse models generated during local training, and propose two distance measurements to further enhance the model diversity and mitigate the effect of non-IID data. Consequently, our proposed framework can improve the global model performance while maintaining low communication costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance to existing one-shot PFL methods and achieves better accuracy compared with state-of-the-art one-shot SFL methods on both label-skew and domain-shift tasks (e.g., 6%+ accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-10 dataset).</description>

      <title>mABC: multi-Agent Blockchain-Inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating complexity of micro-services architecture in cloud-native technologies poses significant challenges for maintaining system stability and efficiency. To conduct root cause analysis (RCA) and resolution of alert events, we propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), to revolutionize the AI for IT operations (AIOps) domain, where multiple agents based on the powerful large language models (LLMs) perform blockchain-inspired voting to reach a final agreement following a standardized process for processing tasks and queries provided by Agent Workflow. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating within a decentralized chain. To avoid potential instability issues in LLMs and fully leverage the transparent and egalitarian advantages inherent in a decentralized structure, mABC adopts a decision-making process inspired by blockchain governance principles while considering the contribution index and expertise index of each agent. Experimental results on the public benchmark AIOps challenge dataset and our created train-ticket dataset demonstrate superior performance in accurately identifying root causes and formulating effective solutions, compared to previous strong baselines. The ablation study further highlights the significance of each component within mABC, with Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting being crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture and achieves a significant improvement in the AIOps domain compared to existing baselines</description>

      <title>De-DSI: Decentralised Differentiable Search Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces De-DSI, a novel framework that fuses large language models (LLMs) with genuine decentralization for information retrieval, particularly employing the differentiable search index (DSI) concept in a decentralized setting. Focused on efficiently connecting novel user queries with document identifiers without direct document access, De-DSI operates solely on query-docid pairs. To enhance scalability, an ensemble of DSI models is introduced, where the dataset is partitioned into smaller shards for individual model training. This approach not only maintains accuracy by reducing the number of data each model needs to handle but also facilitates scalability by aggregating outcomes from multiple models. This aggregation uses a beam search to identify top docids and applies a softmax function for score normalization, selecting documents with the highest scores for retrieval. The decentralized implementation demonstrates that retrieval success is comparable to centralized methods, with the added benefit of the possibility of distributing computational complexity across the network. This setup also allows for the retrieval of multimedia items through magnet links, eliminating the need for platforms or intermediaries.</description>

Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying natural divisions in networks. Efficient parallel algorithms for identifying such divisions is critical in a number of applications, where the size of datasets have reached significant scales. This technical report presents one of the most efficient multicore implementations of the Louvain algorithm, a high quality community detection method. On a server equipped with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, our Louvain, which we term as GVE-Louvain, outperforms Vite, Grappolo, and NetworKit Louvain by 50x, 22x, and 20x respectively - achieving a processing rate of 560M edges/s on a 3.8B edge graph. In addition, GVE-Louvain improves performance at an average rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads.</description>

      <title>TensAIR: Real-Time Training of Neural Networks from Data-streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online learning (OL) from data streams is an emerging area of research that encompasses numerous challenges from stream processing, machine learning, and networking. Stream-processing platforms, such as Apache Kafka and Flink, have basic extensions for the training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in a stream-processing pipeline. However, these extensions were not designed to train ANNs in real-time, and they suffer from performance and scalability issues when doing so. This paper presents TensAIR, the first OL system for training ANNs in real time. TensAIR achieves remarkable performance and scalability by using a decentralized and asynchronous architecture to train ANN models (either freshly initialized or pre-trained) via DASGD (decentralized and asynchronous stochastic gradient descent). We empirically demonstrate that TensAIR achieves a nearly linear scale-out performance in terms of (1) the number of worker nodes deployed in the network, and (2) the throughput at which the data batches arrive at the dataflow operators. We depict the versatility of TensAIR by investigating both sparse (word embedding) and dense (image classification) use cases, for which TensAIR achieved from 6 to 116 times higher sustainable throughput rates than state-of-the-art systems for training ANN in a stream-processing pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cost models predict the cost of executing given assembly code basic blocks on a specific microarchitecture. Recently, neural cost models have been shown to be fairly accurate and easy to construct. They can replace heavily engineered analytical cost models used in mainstream compiler workflows. However, their black-box nature discourages their adoption. In this work, we develop the first framework, COMET, for generating faithful, generalizable, and intuitive explanations for neural cost models. We generate and compare COMET's explanations for the popular neural cost model, Ithemal against those for an accurate CPU simulation-based cost model, uiCA. Our empirical findings show an inverse correlation between the prediction errors of Ithemal and uiCA and the granularity of basic block features in COMET's explanations for them, thus indicating potential reasons for the higher error of Ithemal with respect to uiCA.</description>
