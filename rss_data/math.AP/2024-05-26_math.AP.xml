      <title>Linearized Boundary Control Method for Density Reconstruction in Acoustic Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a linearized boundary control method for the inverse boundary value problem of determining a density in the acoustic wave equation. The objective is to reconstruct an unknown perturbation in a known background density from the linearized Neumann-to-Dirichlet map. A key ingredient in the derivation is a linearized Blagovescenskii's identity with a free parameter. When the linearization is at a constant background density, we derive two reconstructive algorithms with stability estimates based on the boundary control method. When the linearization is at a non-constant background density, we establish an increasing stability estimate for the recovery of the density perturbation. The proposed reconstruction algorithms are implemented and validated with several numerical experiments to demonstrate the feasibility.</description>

      <title>Uniform Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimates in multiscale elliptic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the elliptic equation $-\text{div} (A_\varepsilon \nabla u_\varepsilon) = \text{div} f$ in a bounded $C^1$ domain, where $A_\varepsilon$ takes a form of $A_\varepsilon(x) = A(x/\varepsilon_1, x/\varepsilon_2,\cdots, x/\varepsilon_n)$, with $A(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_n)$ being 1-periodic in each $y_i$. We prove the uniform Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimate, namely, the uniform $L^p$ boundedness of the linear map $f\mapsto \nabla u_\varepsilon$ for any $p\in (1,\infty)$ with a constant independent of small parameters $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2,\cdots, \varepsilon_n) \in (0,1]^n$. Our result includes the uniform Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimate in quasiperiodic elliptic homogenization (even without the Diophantine condition), which was previously unknown. The proof novelly combines the Dirichlet's theorem on the simultaneous Diophantine approximation from number theory, a technique of reperiodization, reiterated periodic homogenization and a large-scale real-variable argument. Using the idea of reperiodization, we also obtain some large-scale or mesoscopic-scale Lipschitz estimates.</description>

      <title>On a classification of steady solutions to two-dimensional Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a classification of steady solutions to two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in terms of the set of flow angles. The first main result asserts that the set of flow angles of any bounded steady flow in the whole plane must be the whole circle unless the flow is a parallel shear flow. In an infinitely long horizontal strip or the upper half-plane supplemented with slip boundary conditions, besides the two types of flows appeared in the whole space case, there exists an additional class of steady flows for which the set of flow angles is either the upper or lower closed semicircles. This type of flows is proved to be the class of non-shear flows that have the least total curvature. As consequences, we obtain Liouville-type theorems for two-dimensional semilinear elliptic equations with only bounded and measurable nonlinearity, and the structural stability of shear flows whose all stagnation points are not inflection points, including Poiseuille flow as a special case. Our proof relies on the analysis of some quantities related to the curvature of the streamlines.</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for the mass supercritical Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system: existence, limit behavior, strong instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the normalized ground states for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics. This equation has a nonlocal nonlinearity and a mass supercritical power nonlinearity, both of which have deep impact on the geometry of the corresponding functional, and thus on the existence, limit behavior and stability of the normalized ground states. In the present study, the existence of critical points is obtained by a mountain-pass argument developed on the $L^2$-spheres. To be specific, we show that normalized ground states exist, provided that spherical radius of the $L^2$-spheres is sufficiently small. Then, by discussing the convergence relation of the minimizer for the minimization problem between the Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system and the minimization problem of the classical Schrodinger equation, we show a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the normalized ground states as the mass vanishes or tends to infinity. Finally, the strong instability of standing waves at the mountain-pass energy level is studied by constructing an equivalent minimizing problem. Also, as a byproduct, we prove that the mountain-pass energy level gives a threshold for global existence based on this equivalent minimizing problem.</description>

      <title>Manifold Solutions to Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed dynamic manifold solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations using an extension of differential geometry called the calculus for moving surfaces. Specifically, we have shown that the geometric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations can take the form of fluctuating spheres, constant mean curvature surfaces, generic wave equations for compressible systems, and arbitrarily curved shapes for incompressible systems in various scenarios. These solutions apply to predominantly incompressible and compressible systems for the equations in any dimension, while the remaining cases are yet to be solved. We have demonstrated that for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, geometric solutions are always bound by the curvature tensor of the closed smooth manifold for every smooth velocity field. As a result, solutions always converge for systems with constant volumes.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and invariant measures for the stochastically perturbed Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the initial-boundary value problem for the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar (SLLBar) equation with Stratonovich-type noise in bounded domains $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=1,2,3$. Our main results can be briefly described as follows: (1) for $d=1,2,3$ and any $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{H}^1$, the SLLBar equation admits a unique local-in-time pathwise weak solution; (2) for $d=1$ and small-data $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{H}^1$, the SLLBar equation has a unique global-in-time pathwise weak solution and at least one invariant measure; (3) for $d=1,2$ and small-data $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{L}^2$, the SLLBar equation possesses a unique global-in-time pathwise very weak solution and at least one invariant measure, while for $d=3$ only the existence of martingale solution is obtained due to the loss of pathwise uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Limit for Congestion Dynamics in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses congested transport, which can be described, at macroscopic scales, by a continuity equation with a pressure variable generated from the hard-congestion constraint (maximum value of the density). The main goal of the paper is to show that, in one spatial dimension, this continuum PDE can be derived as the mean-field limit of a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the motion of a large number of particles constrained to stay at some finite distance from each others. To show that these two models describe the same dynamics at different scale, we will rely on both the Eulerian and Lagrangian points of view and use two different approximations for the density and pressure variables in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations around the mean-field limit for attractive Riesz potentials in the moderate regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central limit theorem is shown for moderately interacting particles in the whole space. The interaction potential approximates singular attractive or repulsive potentials of sub-Coulomb type. It is proved that the fluctuations become asymptotically Gaussians in the limit of infinitely many particles. The methodology is inspired by the classical work of Oelschl\"ager on fluctuations for the porous-medium equation. The novelty in this work is that we can allow for attractive potentials in the moderate regime and still obtain asymptotic Gaussian fluctuations. The key element of the proof is the mean-square convergence in expectation for smoothed empirical measures associated to moderately interacting $N$-particle systems with rate $N^{-1/2-\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$. To allow for attractive potentials, the proof uses a quantitative mean-field convergence in probability with any algebraic rate and a law-of-large-numbers estimate as well as a systematic separation of the terms to be estimated in a mean-field part and a law-of-large-numbers part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this dissertation we study basic local differential geometry, projective differential geometry, and prolongations of overdetermined geometric partial differential equations. It is simple to prolong an n-th order linear ordinary differential equation into n first order equations. For partial differential equations there is a related process but it is far more subtle and complex. Considerable work has been done in this area but much of this is very abstract and there are many open problems even at a relatively elementary level. We introduce the reader to differential geometry and tractor calculus before recovering the projective tractor and cotractor connections via the prolongation of appropriate partial differential equations. Following this, we study prolongation of other projectively invariant equations, a particular focus is an equation known as the projective metrisability equation.</description>

      <title>Inverse mean curvature flow with outer obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new boundary condition for the weak inverse mean curvature flow, which gives canonical and non-trivial solutions in bounded domains. Roughly speaking, the boundary of the domain serves as an outer obstacle, and the evolving hypersurfaces are assumed to stick tangentially to the boundary upon contact. In smooth bounded domains, we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for weak solutions, and establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of the level sets up to the obstacle. The proof combines various techniques, including elliptic regularization, blow-up analysis, and certain parabolic estimates. As an analytic application, we address the well-posedness problem for the usual weak inverse mean curvature flow, showing in a broad generality that the initial value problem always admits a unique maximal (or innermost) weak solution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Analysis of a Cocaine-Heroin Epidemiological Model with Spatial Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article conducts an in-depth investigation of a new spatio-temporal model for the cocaine-heroin epidemiological model with vital dynamics, incorporating the Laplacian operator. The study rigorously establishes the existence, uniqueness, non-negativity, and boundedness of solutions for the proposed model. In addition, the local stability of both a drug-free equilibrium and a drug-addiction equilibrium are analyzed by studying the corresponding characteristic equations. The research provides conclusive evidence that when the basic reproductive number $\mathcal{R}_0$ exceeds 1, the drug-addiction equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Conversely, using comparative arguments, it is shown that if $\mathcal{R}_0$ is less than 1, the drug-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, the article includes a series of numerical simulations to visually convey and support the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Reducing the cost of posterior sampling in linear inverse problems via task-dependent score learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) offer a flexible approach to sample from the posterior distribution in a variety of Bayesian inverse problems. In the literature, the prior score is utilized to sample from the posterior by different methods that require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping in order to generate a single posterior sample. These methods are often designed with the objective of enabling the direct use of the unconditional prior score and, therefore, task-independent training. In this paper, we focus on linear inverse problems, when evaluation of the forward mapping is computationally expensive and frequent posterior sampling is required for new measurement data, such as in medical imaging. We demonstrate that the evaluation of the forward mapping can be entirely bypassed during posterior sample generation. Instead, without introducing any error, the computational effort can be shifted to an offline task of training the score of a specific diffusion-like random process. In particular, the training is task-dependent requiring information about the forward mapping but not about the measurement data. It is shown that the conditional score corresponding to the posterior can be obtained from the auxiliary score by suitable affine transformations. We prove that this observation generalizes to the framework of infinite-dimensional diffusion models introduced recently and provide numerical analysis of the method. Moreover, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a hierarchical multi-objective control problem for forward stochastic parabolic equations with dynamic boundary conditions. The controls are divided into two classes: leaders and followers. The goal of the leaders is of null controllability type while the followers are in charge of letting the state close to prescribed targets in fixed observation regions. To solve the problem, Nash and Stackelberg strategies are used. To implement these strategies, we combine some appropriate Carleman estimates and the well-known control duality approach.</description>

      <title>On the hydrostatic limit of stably stratified fluids with isopycnal diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with rigorously justifying the hydrostatic limit for continuously stratified incompressible fluids under the influence of gravity.
  The main distinction of this work compared to previous studies is the absence of any (regularizing) viscosity contribution added to the fluid-dynamics equations; only thickness diffusivity effects are considered. Motivated by applications to oceanography, the diffusivity effects in this work arise from an additional advection term, the specific form of which was proposed by Gent and McWilliams in the 1990s to model the effective contributions of geostrophic eddy correlations in non-eddy-resolving systems.
  The results of this paper heavily rely on the assumption of stable stratification. We establish the well-posedness of the hydrostatic equations and the original (non-hydrostatic) equations for stably stratified fluids, along with their convergence in the limit of vanishing shallow-water parameter. These results are obtained in high but finite Sobolev regularity and carefully account for the various parameters involved.
  A key element of our analysis is the reformulation of the systems using isopycnal coordinates, enabling us to provide meticulous energy estimates that are not readily apparent in the original Eulerian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solution to Unsteady Darcy-Brinkman Problem with Korteweg Stress for Modelling Miscible Porous Media Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work investigates a model that combines a convection-diffusion-reaction equation for solute concentration with an unsteady Darcy-Brinkman equation for the flow field, including the Kortweg stress. Additionally, the flow field experiences an external body force term while the permeability fluctuates with solute concentration. Such models are used to describe flows in porous mediums such as fractured karst reservoirs, mineral wool, industrial foam, coastal mud, etc. The system of equations has Neumann boundary conditions for the solute concentration and no-flow conditions for the velocity field, and the well-posedness of the model is discussed for a wide range of initial data. The proofing techniques remain applicable in establishing the well-posedness of non-reactive and homogeneous porous media flows under the specified simplifications.</description>

      <title>Interaction of liquid crystals with a rigid body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the interaction of nematic liquid crystals modeled by a simplified Ericksen-Leslie model with a rigid body. It is shown that this problem is locally strongly well-posed, and that it also admits a unique, global strong solution for initial data close to constant equilibria. The proof of the global strong solution relies on a new splitting method for the director in a mean value zero and average part.</description>

      <title>On stability analysis for steady states of the free boundary hard phase model in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hard phase model describes a relativistic barotropic fluid with sound speed equal to the speed of light. In the framework of general relativity, the motion of the fluid is coupled to the Einstein equations which describe the structure of the underlying spacetime. This model with free boundary admits a $1$-parameter family of steady states with spherical symmetry. In this work, for perturbations within spherical symmetry, we study the stability and instability of this family. We prove that the linearized operator around steady states with large central densities admits a growing mode, while such growing modes do not exist for steady states with small central densities. Based on the linear analysis, we further demonstrate a dynamical nonlinear instability for steady states with large central densities. The proof relies on a spectral analysis of the linearized operator and an a priori estimate on the full nonlinear free boundary problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a specific skew-symmetric formulation of the nonlinear terms in the compressible Navier-Stokes equations leads to an energy rate in terms of surface integrals only. No dissipative volume integrals contribute to the energy rate. We also discuss boundary conditions that bounds the surface integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the variable exponent $p$-Laplacian with boundary data in $W^{1,p(x)}(\Omega)$ on a bounded, smooth domain $\Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^n$. Our main focus will be on an a.e. finite variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ with $n &lt; \inf\limits_{x\in \Omega}p(x)$ and $\sup\limits_{x\in \Omega}p(x) = \infty$ under the sole assumption that $p\in C(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Cross-Diffusion Theory for Overcrowding Dispersal in Interacting Species System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of cross-diffusion systems for studying overcrowding dispersal of two species. The approach, based on proximal minimization energy through a minimum flow process, offers a potential generalization of existing segregation models. Unlike prior methods using PDEs or $W_2$-Wasserstein flows, it establishes a well-posed PDE framework for capturing the interplay between diffusion and concentration gradients. This framework has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of how cross-diffusion shapes spatial patterns, coexistence, and overall distribution of multiple species. Notably, for homogeneous cases, the approach definitely leads to a well-defined PDE grounded in a new general $H^{-1}$-theory specifically developed for overcrowding dispersal. This theory provides a robust foundation for further analysis.</description>

      <title>Relaxing the sharp density stratification and columnar motion assumptions in layered shallow water systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously justify the bilayer shallow-water system as an approximation to the hydrostatic Euler equations in situations where the flow is density-stratified with close-to-piecewise constant density profiles, and close-to-columnar velocity profiles. Our theory accommodates with continuous stratification, so that admissible deviations from bilayer profiles are not pointwise small. This leads us to define refined approximate solutions that are able to describe at first order the flow in the pycnocline. Because the hydrostatic Euler equations are not known to enjoy suitable stability estimates, we rely on thickness-diffusivity contributions proposed by Gent and McWilliams. Our strategy also applies to one-layer and multilayer frameworks.</description>

      <title>Improved generic regularity of codimension-1 minimizing integral currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a smooth, closed, oriented, $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We show that there exist arbitrarily small perturbations $\Gamma'$ of $\Gamma$ with the property that minimizing integral $n$-currents with boundary $\Gamma'$ are smooth away from a set of Hausdorff dimension $\leq n-9-\varepsilon_n$, where $\varepsilon_n \in (0, 1]$ is a dimensional constant.
  This improves on our previous result (where we proved generic smoothness of minimizers in $9$ and $10$ ambient dimensions). The key ingredients developed here are a new method to estimate the full singular set of the foliation by minimizers and a proof of superlinear decay of closeness (near singular points) that holds even across non-conical scales.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following classical conjecture of Besicovitch: a $1$-dimensional Borel set in the plane with finite Hausdorff $1$-dimensional measure $\mathcal{H}^1$ which has lower density strictly larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ almost everywhere must be countably rectifiable. We improve the best known bound, due to Preiss and Ti\v{s}er, showing that the statement is indeed true if $\frac{1}{2}$ is replaced by $\frac{7}{10}$ (in fact we improve the Preiss-Ti\v{s}er bound even for the corresponding statement in general metric spaces). More importantly, we propose a family of variational problems to produce the latter and many other similar bounds and we study several properties of them, paving the way for further improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish fundamental properties satisfied by Parametrized Hamiltonian Stationary Legendrian Varifolds into the Heisenberg Group. Among other properties we prove the sequential weak closure of this space under local area control, finite topology control and conformal class control. This work is the second part of a project launched in [13] about the realisation by Hamiltonian stationary surfaces of any arbitrary non trivial minmax operations on the area among Legendrian surfaces in every closed Sasaki-Einstein 5 dimensional manifold.</description>
