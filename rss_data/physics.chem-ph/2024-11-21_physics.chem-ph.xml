      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>The vDZP Basis Set Is Effective For Many Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, "composite" density-functional-theory-based methods comprising specially optimized combinations of functionals, basis sets, and empirical corrections have become widely used owing to their robustness and computational efficiency, but the bespoke nature of these methods makes them challenging to develop. Here, we report that the recently reported vDZP basis set can be used in combination with a wide variety of density functionals to produce efficient and accurate results comparable to those obtained with composite methods, but without any method- or correction-specific reparameterization. This result enables rapid quantum chemical calculations to be run with a variety of density functionals without the typical errors incurred by small basis sets.</description>

      <title>Making molecules by mergoassociation: the role of center-of-mass motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mergoassociation, two atoms in separate optical traps are combined to form a molecule when the traps are merged. Previous theoretical treatments have considered only the relative motion of the atoms, neglecting coupling to the motion of the center of mass. We develop a theoretical method to include the coupling to center-of-mass motion and consider its consequences for experiments for both weak and strong coupling. We consider the example of RbCs and then extend the treatment to other systems where mergoassociation may be effective, namely RbSr, RbYb and CsYb. We consider the role of the coupling when the traps are anisotropic and the potential use of moveable traps to construct quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>An air-spaced virtually imaged phased array with 94 MHz resolution for precision spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an air-spaced virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometer that resolves the modes of a mid-infrared frequency comb with a repetition rate of 250 MHz, without an optical filter cavity. With a record spectral resolution of 94 MHz for VIPA, the spectrometer enables precision molecular spectroscopy with high resolution, broad spectral coverage and fast data acquisition. We demonstrate the capabilities of the spectrometer by measuring the absorption spectra of molecular species generated in plasmas. Using plasmas of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen, and methane at a low pressure of 1.5 mbar, we obtained high-resolution spectra of methane, around 3017 cm$^{-1}$, as well as hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, around 3240 cm$^{-1}$, demonstrating a wide spectral coverage over 290 cm$^{-1}$ (equivalent to 8.7 THz). The spectrometer performance in terms of Allan-Werle deviation and noise-equivalent absorption is discussed. The air-spaced VIPA concept offers a compact and practical spectrometer that harnesses the full potential of a stabilized frequency comb, making it suitable for a wide range of high-precision spectroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing EPR pulses for broadband excitation and refocusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically optimize broadband pulse shapes that maximize Hahn echo amplitudes. Pulses are parameterized as neural networks (NN), nonlinear amplitude limited Fourier series (FS), and discrete time series (DT). These are compared to an optimized choice of the conventional hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse shape. A power constraint is included, as are realistic shape distortions due to power amplifier nonlinearity and the transfer function of the microwave resonator. We find that the NN, FS, and DT parameterizations perform equivalently, offer improvements over the best HS pulses, and contain a large number of equivalent optimal solutions, implying the flexibility to include further constraints or optimization goals in future designs.</description>

      <title>When Theory Meets Experiment: What Does it Take to Accurately Predict $^1$H NMR Dipolar Relaxation Rates in Neat Liquid Water from Theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Bringing multilevel quantum master equations into Lindblad form for complete positivity tests: Two approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum master equations (QMEs) are the primary workhorse in quantum information science, quantum optics, spectroscopy, and quantum thermodynamics, bringing an arbitrary $N$-level QME into Lindbladian form and verifying complete positivity of the associated quantum dynamical map remain open challenges for $N\ge 3$. We explore and implement two independent methods to accomplish these tasks, which enable one to directly compute the Kossakowski matrix of an arbitrary Markovian QME from its Liouvillian. In the first method, due to Hall, Cresser, Li, and Andersson, the Kossakowski matrix elements are obtained by evaluating the action of the Liouvillian on the orthonormal SU($N$) basis matrices and then computing a sum of matrix-product traces. The second method, developed in this work, is based on the real $N$-level coherence vector and relies on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a rectangular matrix composed of the structure constants of SU$(N)$. We show that both methods give identical results, and apply them to establish the complete positivity of the partial secular Bloch-Redfield QME for the $\Lambda$ and V-systems driven by incoherent light. We find that the eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix of these seemingly different three-level systems are identical, implying close similarities of their dissipative dynamics. By facilitating the expression of multilevel Markovian QMEs in Lindblad form, our results enable testing the QMEs for complete positivity without solving them, as well as restoring complete positivity by keeping only non-negative eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix.</description>
