      <title>Characterization of Ergodic Measures of Maximal Entropy for Topologically Transitive Partially Hyperbolic Diffeomorphisms with compact center leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an upper bound on the number of maximal entropy ergodic measures with zero Lyapunov exponent for topologically transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with compact one-dimensional center leaves on $\mathbb{T}^3$. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive characterization of the support of these measures.</description>

      <title>On the lattice property of the Koopman operator spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has become a celebrated tool in modern dynamical systems theory for analyzing and interpreting both models and datasets. The linearity of the Koopman operator means that important characteristics about it, and in turn its associated nonlinear system, are captured by its eigenpairs and more generally its spectrum. Many studies point out that the spectrum of the Koopman operator has a multiplicative lattice structure by which eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be multiplied to produce new eigenpairs. However, these observations fail to resolve whether the new eigenfunction remains in the domain of the Koopman operator. In this work, we prove that the spectrum of the Koopman operator associated to discrete-time dynamical systems has a multiplicative lattice structure. We further demonstrate that the Koopman operator associated to discrete-time stochastic process does not necessarily have such a structure, demonstrating an important nuance that lies at the heart of Koopman operator theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we proved that for every $C^1$ star vector fields on three-dimensional manifolds, every ergodic hyperbolic invariant measure which is not supported on singularities can be approximated by periodic measures, and the Lyapunov exponents of the ergodic hyperbolic invariant measure can also be approximated by the Lyapunov exponents of those periodic measures.</description>

      <title>Fourier decay of equilibrium states and the Fibonacci Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show positivity of the lower Fourier dimension for equilibrium states of nonlinear, area preserving, Axiom A diffeomorphisms on surfaces. To do so, we use the sum-product phenomenon to reduce Fourier decay to the study of some temporal distance function for a well chosen suspension flow, whose mixing properties reflects the nonlinearity of our base dynamics. We then generalize in an Axiom A setting the methods of Tsujii-Zhang, dealing with exponential mixing of three-dimensional Anosov flows arXiv:2006.04293. The nonlinearity condition is generic and can be checked in concrete contexts. As a corollary, we prove power Fourier decay for the density of states measure of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, which is related to the measure of maximal entropy of the Fibonacci trace map. This proves positivity of the lower Fourier dimension for the spectrum of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, and suggest strong phase-averaged dispersive estimates in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Generic conservative dynamics on Stein manifolds with the volume density property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of generic volume-preserving automorphisms $f$ of a Stein manifold $X$ of dimension at least 2 with the volume density property. Among such $X$ are all connected linear algebraic groups (except $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}^*$) with a left- or right-invariant Haar form. We show that a generic $f$ is chaotic and of infinite topological entropy, and that the transverse homoclinic points of each of its saddle periodic points are dense in $X$. We present analogous results with similar proofs in the non-conservative case. We also prove the Kupka-Smale theorem in the conservative setting.</description>

      <title>Optimal compressed sensing for mixing stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jalali and Poor introduced an asymptotic framework for compressed sensing of stochastic processes, demonstrating that any rate strictly greater than the mean information dimension serves as an upper bound on the number of random linear measurements required for (universal) almost lossless recovery of $\psi^*$-mixing processes, as measured in the normalized $L^2$ norm. In this work, we show that if the normalized number of random linear measurements is strictly less than the mean information dimension, then almost lossless recovery of a $\psi^*$-mixing process is impossible by any sequence of decompressors. This establishes the mean information dimension as the fundamental limit for compressed sensing in this setting (and, in fact, the precise threshold for the problem). To this end, we introduce a new quantity, related to techniques from geometric measure theory: the correlation dimension rate, which is shown to be a lower bound for compressed sensing of arbitrary stationary stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of the projected PO method with additive inflation for the partially observed Lorenz 96 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the filtering problem with the partially observed Lorenz 96 model. Although the accuracy of the 3DVar filter applied to this problem has been established, that of the EnKF has not yet been. This study aims to establish the error bound of a variant of the EnKF, known as the PO method. By introducing the additive inflation and a projection of the background covariance to the observation space, we establish the error bound of the PO method. A numerical example validates theoretical findings and shows the potential to extend the analysis.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties of the intermediate $\beta$-expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\beta&gt;1$ and $\alpha\in[0,1)$, let $T_{\beta, \alpha}(x)=\beta x+\alpha\pmod 1$. Then under the map $T_{\beta,\alpha}$ each $x\in[0,1]$ has an \emph{intermediate $\beta$-expansion} of the form $x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{c_i-\alpha}{\beta^i}$ {with each $c_i\in\{0,1,\ldots,\lf \beta+\alpha\rf\}$}. In this paper we study the approximation properties of $T_{\beta,\alpha}$ by considering the expected value $M_\beta(\alpha)$ of the \emph{normalized errors} $(\theta_{\beta,\alpha}^n(x))_{n\geq 1}$, where $$\theta_{\beta,\alpha}^n(x):=\beta^n\left(x-\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{c_i-\alpha}{\beta^i}\right),\quad n\in\mathbb{N}.$$ We prove that $M_\beta(\cdot)$ is continuous on $[0,1)$. As a result, $\mathcal{M_\beta}:=\{M_\beta(\alpha):\alpha\in[0,1)\}$ is a closed interval. In particular, if $\beta$ is a multinacci number, the map $T_{\beta,\alpha}$ has matching for Lebesgue almost every $\alpha\in[0,1)$, and then $M_\beta(\cdot)$ is locally linear almost everywhere on $[0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Categorical Lyapunov Theory I: Stability of Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for ``doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to ``do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamically inspired invariant subspaces for Koopman and transfer operator approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectra of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We approach this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</description>

      <title>Long-Time and Short-Time Dynamics in a Weighted-Median Opinion Model on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions eventually yield a consensus opinion; in others, they can lead to opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of ``echo chambers''. Consider a social network of individuals with continuous-valued scalar opinions, and suppose that they can change their opinions when they interact with each other. In many models of the opinion dynamics of individuals in a network, it is common for opinion updates to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. As an alternative, which may be more realistic in some situations, we study an opinion model with an opinion-update rule that depends on the weighted median of the opinions of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our median-update opinion model, we investigate how the final opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals. We numerically investigate its accuracy for short-time opinion dynamics on various networks.</description>

Abstract: We construct the smooth, compact moduli space of similarity classes of labeled, oriented triangles. The space, denoted $\mathfrak D$, is a connected sum of three projective planes, and projects via blowdown to two shape spaces that have appeared in the literature: the well-known (Riemann) sphere (\cite{Kend84}, \cite{Beh}, \cite{Montgomery}, \cite{ES15}), and the less-well-known 2-torus (\cite{BG23}). A natural action by the dihedral group $D_6$ defines the quotient stack $[\mathfrak D/D_6]$ of absolute (unlabeled, unoriented) classes.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is to give a short proof of a result of Py\"or\"al\"a--Shmerkin--Suomala--Wu; the Sierpi\'nski carpet, and generalisations, are tube-null; they can be covered with tubes of arbitrarily small total width. We remark that a more general class of sponge-like sets satisfy this property. For a given $\epsilon &gt; 0$ the proof is able to give an explicit description of the tubes for which the total width is less than $\epsilon.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative necessary and sufficient condition for a spiral arc to be a H\"older arc. The class of spiral arcs contains the polynomial spirals studied by Fraser, and the elliptical spirals studied by Burrell-Falconer-Fraser. As an application, we recover the sharp result on the H\"older winding problem for polynomial spirals. Moreover, we provide a sharp exponent estimate for the H\"older classification of polynomial spirals, which coincides with the corresponding quasiconformal classification estimate, and improve certain exponent bounds of Burrell-Falconer-Fraser on the H\"older classification of elliptical spirals.</description>
