      <title>Field-free Josephson diode effect in a d-wave superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconductor/normal region/superconductor (S|N|S) Josephson junction formed using superconductors with d, d + id', and d + is superconducting pairings. We show that the quality factor of the Josephson diode effect and its sign can be substantially tuned by the external magnetic field, gate voltage, and the length of the junction for all three types of pairings. We also identify the conditions under which the anomalous Josephson and Josephson diode effects can appear in the junction by analyzing appropriate symmetries. In particular, by breaking a {\pi}-rotation symmetry, we show how a large field-free Josephson diode effect can be realized even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We also study the role of edge states appearing in the case of chiral superconductor with d + id' pairing. Our results demonstrate that the Josephson diode effect in a planar geometry can be used as a signature of unconventional superconducting pairings.</description>

      <title>Molybdenum low resistance thin film resistors for cryogenic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of thin-film molybdenum resistors for NbN electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures. The key step is the 0.5-1.5 keV ion cleaning-activation of NbN before Mo deposition which allows to obtain a high-quality Mo/NbN interface which together with additional aluminum bandage layer in the area of contact pads allow to reduce contact resistance below 1 Ohm. The quality of the interfaces is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray reflectometry.</description>

      <title>Progress, problems and prospects of room-temperature superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of superconductivity at megabar (MB) pressures in hydrogen sulfide H3S, then in metal polyhydrides, starting with binary, LaH10, etc., and ending with ternary ones, including (La, Y)H10, revolutionized the field of condensed matter physics. These discoveries strengthen hopes for solution of the century-old problem of creating materials that are superconducting at room temperature. In experiments performed over the past 5 years at MB pressures, in addition to the synthesis of hydrides itself, their physical properties were studied using optical, X-ray and Mossbauer spectroscopy, as well as galvanomagnetic measurement techniques. This paper presents the major results of galvanomagnetic studies, including measurements in high static (up to 21T) and pulsed (up to 70T) magnetic fields. Measurements of resistance drops to vanishingly small level at temperatures below the critical Tc value, a decrease in the critical temperature Tc with increasing magnetic field, as well as diamagnetic screening, indicate the superconducting state of the polyhydrides. The results of measurements of the isotope effect, together with the effect of magnetic impurities on Tc, indicate the electron-phonon mechanism of electron pairing. However, electron-electron correlations in polyhydrides are by no means small, both in the superconducting and normal states. It is possible that this is precisely what accounts for the unusual properties of polyhydrides that have not yet received a satisfactory explanation, such as a linear temperature dependence of the second critical field Hc2(T), a linear dependence of resistance R(T), and a linear magnetoresistance, very similar to that discovered by P. L. Kapitza in 1929.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Quantized Andreev conductance in semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clean one-dimensional electron systems can exhibit quantized conductance. The plateau conductance doubles if the transport is dominated by Andreev reflection. Here, we report quantized conductance observed in both Andreev and normal-state transports in PbTe-Pb and PbTe-In hybrid nanowires. The Andreev plateau is observed at $4e^2/h$, twice of the normal plateau value of $2e^2/h$. In comparison, Andreev conductance in the best-optimized III-V nanowires is non-quantized due to mode-mixing induced dips (a disorder effect), despite the quantization of normal-state transport. The negligible mode mixing in PbTe hybrids indicates an unprecedented low-disorder transport regime for nanowire devices, beneficial for Majorana researches.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-6e condensed phase in Kagome lattice superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the experimental evidence of a charge-$6e$ condensed phase in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{AV_3Sb_5}$ (J. Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)) has sparked significant interest. At a phenomenological level, the order parameter of the $3Q$ pair-density-wave state can form either a triangular lattice or a kagome lattice, in which the vortices and antivortices locate at the center of the plaquettes. When the phase of a Cooper pair is denoted as a XY spin, the effective model for the phase fluctuation is characterized by the frustrated XY spin model on a triangular lattice with the nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic coupling or a kagome lattice with both nearest neighbour and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings. While both models produce $\frac{1}{3}$ fractional vortex excitations, which arise as the kinks on the domain walls in the low-energy excitations, the triangular lattice model has a much larger domain wall energy than the vortex interaction energy, so the frustrated kagome lattice model becomes unique. By developing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the presence of a vestigial phase with $\frac{1}{3}$ vortex-antivortex paired phase in the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magneto-resistant oscillations observed in the recent experimental work.</description>

      <title>In-situ Formation of Superconducting FeTe/layered-MnTe heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manganese telluride (MnTe) has garnered strong interest recently for its antiferromagnetic semiconductor properties, which are promising for applications in spintronics, data storage, and quantum computing. In this study, we discovered that the deposition of FeTe at 300oC onto zinc-blende MnTe (ZB-MnTe) via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) results in a phase transition from ZB-MnTe to a layered MnTe (l-MnTe) phase with van der Waals (vdW) gaps, which is a previously unreported phase of MnTe. The l-MnTe phase was characterized using cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Fe/Te flux ratio during FeTe deposition was found to be critical to the phase transition, an increased Fe/Te flux ratio used for the FeTe growth leads to localized formation of layered Mn4Te3 (l-Mn4Te3), while a decreased Fe/Te flux ratio only generates a single monolayer of l-MnTe at the interface and the rest turns into a distorted ZB-MnTe (dZB-MnTe) phase. It was also found that FT-MT heterostructures grown at a lower substrate temperature of 250oC, as the Fe/Te flux ratio decreases, the ZB-MnTe layer was first transformed to dZB-MnTe and then to wurtzite MnTe (WZ-MnTe). The FeTe/l-MnTe heterostructure exhibits high-quality superconducting properties with a three-dimensional nature as demonstrated by its magneto-transport properties and there is evidence that l-MnTe seems to play a key role in inducing the observed superconductivity. Most importantly, this study reports the realization of layered structures of MnTe by an in-situ approach via chemical interactions, which might be further applied to generating unprecedented phases of materials under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Fermi arcs mediated transport in inversion symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal nanowire and its hybrid junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of gapless surface states, known as Fermi arcs (FAs), is one of the unique properties of the novel topological Weyl semimetal (WSM). However, extracting the signatures of FAs from the bulk states has always been a challenge as both of them are gapless in nature and connected to each other. We capture the signatures of FAs via transport in an inversion symmetry (IS)-broken WSM. We study the band structure and the properties of FAs like shape, spin polarization considering slab and nanowire (NW) geometry, and then compute the two-terminal conductance in WSM NW in terms of the scattering coefficients within the Landauer formalism. We find the FA-mediated conductance to be quantized in units of $2e^2/h$. We extend our study to the transport in WSM/Weyl superconductor (WSC) NW hybrid junction using the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) formalism. We show that due to the intricate spin textures, the signatures of the FAs can be captured via Andreev reflection process. We also show that our results of conductance are robust against delta-correlated quenched disorder and thus enhancing the experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Superconductivity in Twisted Graphene Multilayers</title>

Abstract: The group of moir\'e graphene superconductors keeps growing, and by now it contains twisted graphene multilayers and twisted double bilayers. We analyze the contribution of long range charge fluctuations in the superconductivity of twisted double graphene bilayers and helical trilayers, and compare the results to twisted bilayer graphene. We apply a diagrammatic approach which depends on a few, well known parameters. We find that the critical temperature and the order parameter differ significantly between twisted double bilayers and helical trilayers on one hand, and twisted bilayer graphene on the other. We show that this trend, consistent with experiments, can be associated to the role played by moir\'e Umklapp processes in the different systems.</description>

      <title>Gate- and flux-tunable sin(2$\varphi$) Josephson element with proximitized Ge-based junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs) function as Josephson junctions with a gate-tunable critical current. Additionally, they can feature a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR) containing multiple harmonics of the superconducting phase difference, a so-far underutilized property. In this work, we exploit this multi-harmonicity to create a Josephson circuit element with an almost perfectly $\pi$-periodic CPR, indicative of a largely dominant charge-4e supercurrent transport. Such a Josephson element was recently proposed as the basic building block of a protected superconducting qubit. Here, it is realized using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with low-inductance aluminum arms and two nominally identical JoFETs. The latter are fabricated from a SiGe/Ge/SiGe quantum-well heterostructure embedding a high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas. By carefully adjusting the JoFET gate voltages and finely tuning the magnetic flux through the SQUID close to half a flux quantum, we achieve a regime where the $\sin(2\varphi)$ component accounts for more than \SI{95}{\percent} of the total supercurrent. This result demonstrates a new promising route for the realization of superconducting qubits with enhanced coherence properties.</description>
