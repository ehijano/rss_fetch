      <title>Dynamical freezing in the thermodynamic limit: the strongly driven ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ergodicity postulate, a foundational pillar of Gibbsian statistical mechanics predicts that a periodically driven (Floquet) system in the absence of any conservation law heats to a featureless `infinite temperature' state. Here, we find--for a clean and interacting generic spin chain subject to a {\it strong} driving field--that this can be prevented by the emergence of {\it approximate but stable} conservation-laws not present in the undriven system. We identify their origin: they do not necessarily owe their stability to familiar protections by symmetry, topology, disorder, or even high energy costs. We show numerically, {\it in the thermodynamic limit,} that when required by these emergent conservation-laws, the entanglement-entropy density of an infinite subsystem remains zero over our entire simulation time of several decades in natural units. We further provide a recipe for designing such conservation laws with high accuracy. Finally, we present an ensemble description, which we call the strongly driven ensemble incorporating these constraints. This provides a way to control many-body chaos through stable Floquet-engineering. Strong signatures of these conservation-laws should be experimentally accessible since they manifest in all length and time scales. Variants of the spin model we have used, have already been realized using Rydberg-dressed atoms.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory of random graphs with prescribed degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical field theory methods have been very successful with a number of random graph and random matrix problems, but it is challenging to apply these methods to graphs with prescribed degree sequences due to the extensive number of constraints that enforce the desired degree at each vertex. Building on top of recent results where similar methods are applied to random regular graph counting, we develop an accurate statistical field theory description for the adjacency matrix spectra of graphs with prescribed degrees. For large graphs, the expectation values are dominated by functional saddle points satisfying explicit equations. For the case of regular graphs, this immediately leads to the known McKay distribution. We then consider mixed-regular graphs with N1 vertices of degree d1, N2 vertices of degree d2, etc, such that the ratios N_i/N are kept fixed as N goes to infinity. For such graphs, the eigenvalue densities are governed by nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. Solving these equations numerically reproduces with an excellent accuracy the empirical eigenvalue distributions.</description>

      <title>Performance of Domain-Wall Encoding in a Digital Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To tackle combinatorial optimization problems on an Ising machine, the objective function and constraints have to be mapped onto a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. Since the QUBO consists of binary variables when combinatorial optimization problems involve integer values, the integer values have to be encoded using binary variables. The encoding methods are called binary-integer encoding. Domain-wall encoding is one of the binary-integer encodings that has been recently proposed. Experiments conducted on a quantum annealing machine have demonstrated that the domain-wall encoding exhibits superior performance compared to the well-known one-hot encoding. In a digital Ising machine, the computation time required to reach the optimal or feasible solution was found to be shorter for domain-wall encoding than for one-hot encoding. However, the performance of domain-wall encoding on a digital Ising machine remains unclear from a practically important point of view. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the one-hot encoding and domain-wall encoding in a digital Ising machine using the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To compare the performances, the penalty coefficient dependency and the sensitivity to the computation time were investigated. It is demonstrated that the domain-wall encoding indicated a higher feasible solution rate at the value of penalty coefficient, which was not commonly used in a number of previous studies. It is also shown that the domain-wall encoding gives higher values than the one-hot encoding in practical evaluation metrics for QKPs with large knapsack capacities. Furthermore, the domain-wall encoding is found to be more sensitive to computation time than the one-hot encoding.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD), systems are molecules made up of    atoms, and the aim is to determine their evolution over time.  MD    is based on a numerical resolution algorithm, whose role is to    apply the forces generated by the various components, according to    the equations of Newtonian physics. Molecular Dynamics is    currently mainly used in materials science and molecular biology.  In this document, we limit ourselves to {\it alkanes} which are  non-cyclic carbon-hydrogenated chains. In the basic ``All-atom''  (AA) scale, all the atoms are directly simulated. In the  ``United-atom'' (UA) scale, one considers grains that are composed  of a carbon atom with the hydrogen atoms attached to it. Grains in  the ``Coarse-grained'' (CG) scale are composed of two consecutive UA  grains. In the multi-scale approach, one tries to use as much as  possible the UA and CG scales which can be more efficiently  simulated than the AA scale.  In this document, we mainly put the focus on three topics.  First, we describe an MD system, implemented in the Java  programming language, according to the Synchronous Reactive  Programming approach in which there exists a notion of a global  logical time.  This system is used to simulate molecules and also to  build the potentials functions at the UA and CG scales.  Second, two methods to derive UA and CG potentials from AA  potentials are proposed and analysed. Basically, both methods rely  on strong geometrical links with the AA scale. We use these links  with AA to determine the forms and values of the UA and CG  potentials.  In the first method (called ``inverse-Boltzmann''), one  considers data produced during several AA scale molecule  simulations, and one processes these data using a statistical  approach. In the second method (``minimisation method''), one  applies a constrained-minimisation technique to AA molecules. The  most satisfactory method clearly appears to be the  minimisation-based one.  The UA potentials we have determined have  standard forms: they only differ from AA potentials by parameter  values. On the opposite, CG potentials are non-standard  functions. We show how to implement them with functions defined ``by  cases''.  Finally, we consider ``reconstructions'' which are means to  dynamically change molecule scales during simulations.  In  particular, we consider automatic reconstructions based on the  proximity of molecules.</description>

      <title>Optimal Finite-time Maxwell's Demons in Langevin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the optimal protocols to achieve the minimal entropy production in finite-time information exchange processes in Langevin systems, on the basis of optimal transport theory. Our general results hold even for non-Gaussian cases, while we derive a concise expression of the minimal entropy production for Gaussian processes. In particular, we apply our results to Maxwell's demons that perform measurement and feedback, and demonstrate Gaussian and non-Gaussian models of optimal demons operating in finite time. Our results provide a general strategy for controlling Langevin systems, including colloidal particles and biomolecules, in a thermodynamically optimal manner beyond the quasi-static limit.</description>

      <title>Partition function zeros of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane (Fisher zeros) and in the complex external field plane (Lee-Yang zeros) of a frustrated Ising model with competing nearest-neighbor ($J_1 &gt; 0$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2 &lt; 0$) interactions on the honeycomb lattice. We consider the finite-size scaling (FSS) of the leading Fisher and Lee-Yang zeros as determined from a cumulant method and compare it to a traditional scaling analysis based on the logarithmic derivative of the magnetization $\partial \ln \langle |M| \rangle /\partial\beta$ and the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$. While for this model both FSS approaches are subject to strong corrections to scaling induced by the frustration, their behavior is rather different, in particular as the ratio $\mathcal{R} = J_2/J_1$ is varied. As a consequence, an analysis of the scaling of partition function zeros turns out to be a useful complement to a more traditional FSS analysis. For the cumulant method, we also study the convergence as a function of cumulant order, providing suggestions for practical implementations. The scaling of the zeros convincingly shows that the system remains in the Ising universality class for $\mathcal{R}$ as low as $-0.22$, where results from traditional FSS using the same simulation data are less conclusive. The approach hence provides a valuable additional tool for mapping out the phase diagram of models afflicted by strong corrections to scaling.</description>

      <title>Random walks with long-range memory on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable random walk model with long-range memory on arbitrary networks. The walker performs unbiased random steps to nearest-neighbor nodes and intermittently resets to previously visited nodes in a preferential way, such that the most visited nodes have proportionally a higher probability to be chosen for revisit. The occupation probability can be expressed as a sum over the eigenmodes of the standard random walk matrix of the network, where the amplitudes slowly decay as power-laws at large time, instead of exponentially. The stationary state is the same as in the absence of memory and detailed balance is fulfilled. However, the relaxation of the transient part becomes critically self-organized at late times, as it is dominated by a single power-law whose exponent depends on the second largest eigenvalue and on the resetting probability. We apply our findings to finite networks such as rings, complete graphs, Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'asi-Albert random networks, or Barbell graphs. Our study extends to network geometries a previous preferential model considering confined diffusive particles in one dimension, and could be of interest for modeling transport phenomena in complex systems, such as human mobility, epidemic spreading, or animal foraging.</description>

      <title>Mind the memory: Artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate due to inconsistent time reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, it is shown that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A scale dependence of higher-order dissipation estimators signifies hidden dissipative cycles. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for memory effects in analyzing coarse observations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Oscillations from Many-Body Quantum Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum scars are nonthermal eigenstates that prevent thermalization of initial states with weight on the scars. When the scar states are equally spaced in energy, superpositions of scars show oscillating local observables that can be detected in experiments. However, we note that scarred models in the literature show fundamentally different scar entanglement dynamics: some show entanglement oscillations while others are completely frozen. We explain this freezing through a no-go theorem which we apply to more than a dozen scarred models in the literature. We also discuss a method for evading the no-go theorem by deforming the scarred models with frozen scar entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Routing and Scheduling Optimization for Urban Air Mobility Fleet Management using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of urban air mobility (UAM) for urban transportation and delivery has accelerated due to increasing traffic congestion and its environmental and economic repercussions. Efficiently managing the anticipated high-density air traffic in cities is critical to ensure safe and effective operations. In this study, we propose a routing and scheduling framework to address the needs of a large fleet of UAM vehicles operating in urban areas. Using mathematical optimization techniques, we plan efficient and deconflicted routes for a fleet of vehicles. Formulating route planning as a maximum weighted independent set problem enables us to utilize various algorithms and specialized optimization hardware, such as quantum annealers, which has seen substantial progress in recent years. Our method is validated using a traffic management simulator tailored for the airspace in Singapore. Our approach enhances airspace utilization by distributing traffic throughout a region. This study broadens the potential applications of optimization techniques in UAM traffic management.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the textbook formula for the pressure of free massless fermions leads to negative values of the probability mass function of the distribution of the system of free massless fermions in the fermion number. The ways to resolve this paradox are proposed. A detailed analysis of the corresponding partition function indicates the presence of a Roberge-Weiss transition in the absence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.</description>

      <title>Existence of long-range order in random-field Ising model on Dyson hierarchical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the random-field Ising model on a Dyson hierarchical lattice, where the interactions decay in a power-law-like form, $J(r)\sim r^{-\alpha}$, with respect to the distance. Without a random field, the Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice has a long-range order at finite low temperatures when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. In this study, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, we rigorously prove that there is a long-range order in the random-field Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice at finite low temperatures, including zero temperature, when the strength of the random field is sufficiently small but nonzero. Our proof is based on Dyson's method for the case without a random field, and the concentration inequalities in probability theory enable us to evaluate the effect of a random field.</description>

      <title>Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators: An efficient numerical approach for fermionic path integral simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing numerical exact solvers for open quantum systems is a challenging task due to the non-perturbative and non-Markovian nature when coupling to structured environments. The Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach is a powerful analytical tool to study the dynamics of open quantum systems. Numerical treatments of the influence functional including the quasi-adiabatic propagator technique and the tensor-network-based time-evolving matrix product operator method, have proven to be efficient in studying open quantum systems with bosonic environments. However, the numerical implementation of the fermionic path integral suffers from the Grassmann algebra involved. In this work, we present a detailed introduction of the Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for fermionic open quantum systems. In particular, we introduce the concepts of Grassmann tensor, signed matrix product operator, and Grassmann matrix product state to handle the Grassmann path integral. Using the single-orbital Anderson impurity model as an example, we review the numerical benchmarks for structured fermionic environments for real-time nonequilibrium dynamics, real-time and imaginary-time equilibration dynamics, and its application as an impurity solver. These benchmarks show that our method is a robust and promising numerical approach to study strong coupling physics and non-Markovian dynamics. It can also serve as an alternative impurity solver to study strongly-correlated quantum matter with dynamical mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with random Hurst exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine two stochastic processes with random parameters, which in their basic versions (i.e., when the parameters are fixed) are Gaussian and display long range dependence and anomalous diffusion behavior, characterized by the Hurst exponent. Our motivation comes from biological experiments, which show that the basic models are inadequate for accurate description of the data, leading to modifications of these models in the literature through introduction of the random parameters. The first process, fractional Brownian motion with random Hurst exponent (referred to as FBMRE below) has been recently studied, while the second one, Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with random exponent (RL FBMRE) has not been explored. To advance the theory of such doubly stochastic anomalous diffusion models, we investigate the probabilistic properties of RL FBMRE and compare them to those of FBMRE. Our main focus is on the autocovariance function and the time-averaged mean squared displacement (TAMSD) of the processes. Furthermore, we analyze the second moment of the increment processes for both models, as well as their ergodicity properties. As a specific case, we consider the mixture of two point distributions of the Hurst exponent, emphasizing key differences in the characteristics of RL FBMRE and FBMRE, particularly in their asymptotic behavior. The theoretical findings presented here lay the groundwork for developing new methods to distinguish these processes and estimate their parameters from experimental data.</description>

Abstract: By considering a microscopical model, we derive an evolution equation for single-mode polariton condensate taking into account the fluctuations of the order parameter. We use it to derive an analytical expression for the second order correlation function and the share of coherent occupation of the condensate in presence of pumping-leakage balance.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of personal relationships remain largely unexplored due to the inherent difficulties of the longitudinal data collection process. In this paper, we analyse a dataset tracking the temporal evolution of a network of personal relationships among 900 people over the course of four years. We search for evidence that the network is in equilibrium, meaning that all macroscopic properties remain constant, fluctuating around stable values, while the internal microscopic dynamics are active. We find that the probabilities governing the network dynamics are stationary over time and that the degree distributions, as well as edge and triangle abundances match the theoretical equilibrium distributions expected under these dynamics. Furthermore, we verify that the system satisfies the detailed balance condition, with only minor point deviations, confirming that it is indeed in equilibrium. Remarkably, this equilibrium persists despite a high turnover in network composition, suggesting that it is an inherent characteristic of human social interactions rather than a trait of the individuals themselves. We argue that this equilibrium may be a general feature of human social networks arising from the competition between different dynamical mechanisms and also from the cognitive and material resources management of individuals. From a practical perspective, the fact that networks are in equilibrium could simplify data collection processes, validate the use of cross-sectional data-based methods like Exponential Random Graph Models, and inform the design of interventions. Our findings advance the understanding of collective human behaviour predictability and our ability to describe it using simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to T. Tanaka and Y. Nakayama, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validity of the ergodic hypothesis in quantum systems can be rephrased in the form of the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH), a set of statistical properties for the matrix elements of local observables in energy eigenstates, which is expected to hold in any ergodic system. We test the ETH in a nonintegrable model of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) using the numerical method of Hamiltonian truncation in combination with analytical arguments based on Lorentz symmetry and renormalisation group theory. We find that there is an infinite sequence of eigenstates with the characteristics of quantum many-body scars, that is, exceptional eigenstates with observable expectation values that lie far from thermal values, and we show that these states are one-quasiparticle states. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the eigenstates cover the entire area between two diverging lines: the line of one-quasiparticle states, whose direction is dictated by relativistic kinematics, and the thermal average line. Our results suggest that the strong version of the ETH is violated in any relativistic QFT whose spectrum admits a quasiparticle description.</description>

      <title>Mapping a dissipative quantum spin chain onto a generalized Coulomb gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An XXZ spin chain at zero magnetization is subject to spatially correlated baths acting as dissipation. We show that the low-energy excitations of this model are described by a dissipative sine-Gordon field theory, i.e. a sine-Gordon action with an additional long-range interaction emerging from dissipation. The field theory is then exactly mapped onto a generalized Coulomb gas which, in addition to the usual integer charges, displays half-integer charges that originate from the dissipative baths. These new charges come in pairs linked by a charge-independent logarithmic interaction. In the Coulomb gas picture, we identify a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like phase transition corresponding to the binding of charges and derive the associated perturbative renormalization group equations. For superohmic baths, the transition is due to the binding of the integer charges, while for subohmic baths, it is due to the binding of the half-integer charges, thereby signaling a dissipation-induced transition.</description>

Abstract: Random flights (also called run-and-tumble walks or transport processes) represent finite velocity random motions changing direction at any Poissonian time. These models in d-dimension, can be studied giving a general formulation of the problem valid at any spatial dimension. The aim of this paper is to extend this general analysis to time-fractional processes arising from a non-local generalization of the kinetic equations. The probabilistic interpretation of the solution of the time-fractional equations leads to a time-changed version of the original transport processes. The obtained results provides a clear picture of the role played by the time-fractional derivatives in this kind of random motions. They display an anomalous behavior and are useful to describe several complex systems arising in statistical physics and biology. In particular, we focus on the one-dimensional random flight, called telegraph process, studying the time-fractional version of the classical telegraph equation and providing a suitable interpretation of its stochastic solutions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic inference of correlations in nonequilibrium collective dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of stochastic thermodynamics has revealed many useful fluctuation relations, with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) being a theorem of major interest. When many nonequilibrium currents interact with each other, a naive application of the TUR to an individual current can result in an apparent violation of the TUR bound. Here, we explore how such an apparent violation can be used to put a lower bound on the strength of correlations $C$ as well as the number $N$ of interacting currents in collective dynamics. This lower bound is a combined bound on $C(N-1)$ if only one current is measured, or a bound on $N$ if two currents are measured. Our proposed protocol allows for the inference of hidden correlations in experiment, for example when a team of molecular motors pulls on the same cargo but only one or a subset of them is fluorescently tagged. By solving analytically and numerically several models of many-body nonequilibrium dynamics, we ascertain under which conditions this strategy can be applied and the inferred bound on correlations becomes tight.</description>

Abstract: We numerically study zeroes of the partition function for trimers ($k = 3$) on $3 \times L$ strip. While such results for dimers ($k = 2$) on 2D lattices are well known to always lie on the negative real axis and are unbounded, here we see that the zeroes are bounded on branches in a finite-sized region and with a considerable number of them being complex. We analyze this result further to numerically study the density of zeroes on such branches, estimating the critical power-law exponents, and make interesting observations on density of filled sites in the lattice as a function of activity $z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simple zero-range process with constant rates and one fast rate for a particular occupation number, which diverges with the system size. Surprisingly, this minor modification induces a condensation transition in the thermodynamic limit, where the structure of the condensed phase depends on the scaling of the fast rate. We study this transition and its dependence on system parameters in detail on a rigorous level using size-biased sampling. This approach generalizes to any particle system with stationary product measures, and the techniques used in this paper provide a foundation for a more systematic understanding of condensing models with a non-trivial condensed phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems was motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state was originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. We report here the discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl12O19 . This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long-range antiferroelectric order, despite short-range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling towards a complete freezing at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Universal Upper Bound on Ergotropy and No-Go Theorem by the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal upper bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Non-Ideal Reaction-Diffusion Systems: Implications for Active Self-Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of open non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems, which embodies Flory-Huggins theories of mixtures and chemical reaction network theories. Our theory elucidates the mechanisms underpinning the emergence of self-organized dissipative structures in these systems. It evaluates the dissipation needed to sustain and control them, discriminating the contributions from each reaction and diffusion process with spatial resolution. It also reveals the role of the reaction network in powering and shaping these structures. We identify particular classes of networks in which diffusion processes always equilibrate within the structures, while dissipation occurs solely due to chemical reactions. The spatial configurations resulting from these processes can be derived by minimizing a kinetic potential, contrasting with the minimization of the thermodynamic free energy in passive systems. This framework opens the way to investigating the energetic cost of phenomena such as liquid-liquid phase separation, coacervation, and the formation of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits containing only symmetry-respecting gates. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. These constraints typically include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while 2-qubit gates are semi-universal for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries in qubit systems, SU(d) symmetry with $d\ge 3$ requires 3-qudit gates for semi-universality. Failure of semi-universality precludes the distribution generated by the random circuits from being even a 2-design for the Haar distribution over symmetry-respecting unitaries. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions, satisfied by U(1) and SU(2) for example, the distribution becomes a $t$-design for $t$ growing polynomially with the number of qudits, where the degree is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum integer $t_{\max}$ for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a $t$-design for all $t\leq t_{\max}$. Notably, for U(1), SU(2) and cyclic groups, we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ as a function of the number of qubits and locality of the gates, and for SU(d), we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ for up to $4$-qudit gates.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>
