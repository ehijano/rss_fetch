      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Charge Exchange Emission in Supernova Remnant N132D from XRISM/Resolve Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XRISM has delivered one of its first light observations on N132D, the X-ray brightest supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Utilizing 193 ks of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy data, we conduct a comprehensive search for charge exchange emission. By incorporating a charge exchange model into our spectral analysis, we observe an improvement in the fits of two weak features at 2.41 keV and 2.63 keV. These features, with a combined significance of 99.6%, are consistent with transitions from highly ionized silicon ions in high Rydberg states, which are unique indicators of charge exchange. Our analysis constrains the charge exchange flux to no more than 4% of the total source flux within the 1.7-3.0 keV band, and places an upper limit on the charge exchange interaction velocity at 450 km/s. This result supports ongoing shock-cloud interactions within N132D and highlights the unique capabilities of XRISM to probe the complex physical processes at play.</description>

      <title>Measuring the asymmetric expansion of the Fe ejecta of Cassiopeia A with XRISM/Resolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion structure of supernova remnants (SNRs) is important for understanding not only how heavy elements are distributed into space, but also how supernovae explode. The ejecta expansion structure of the young core-collapse SNR Cas A is investigated, with Doppler parameter mapping of the Fe-K complex by the Resolve microcalorimeter onboard the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, XRISM. It is found that the Fe ejecta are blueshifted in the southeast (SE) and redshifted in the northwest (NW), indicating an incomplete shell structure, similar to the intermediate mass elements (IMEs), such as Si and S. The Fe has a velocity shift of $\sim1400$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the NW and $\sim2160$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the SE region, with the error range of a few 100s km~s$^{-1}$. These values are consistent with those for the IMEs in the NW region, whereas larger than those for the IMEs in the SE region, although the large error region prevented us from concluding which component has significantly higher velocity. The line broadening is larger in the center with values of $\sim$2000--3000~km~s$^{-1}$, and smaller near the edges of the remnant. The radial profiles of the Doppler shift and broadening of the IMEs and Fe indicate that the Fe ejecta may expand asymmetrically as IME ejacta, although the large error regions do not allow us to conclude it. Moreover, we see little bulk Doppler broadening of the Fe lines in the northeastern jet region whereas the IME lines exhibit significant broadening. No such narrow lines are detected in the NW region. These findings suggest an asymmetric expansion of the ejecta potentially driven by large-scale asymmetries originating from the supernova explosion. This interpretation aligns with the large-scale asymmetries predicted by models of neutrino-driven supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>The EMPI Code for Plasma-Induced Effects on Radio Waves I: Non-Magnetized Media and Applications to Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves undergo modifications as they propagate through plasma. We present EMPI (ElectroMagnetic-wave Plasma Interaction), a three-dimensional numerical framework designed to simulate the interaction between radio signals and cold plasma. With input plasma density profiles, intrinsic radio signals, and the time and frequency resolutions of the telescope, the code synthesizes observed signals using first-principles calculations. EMPI is capable of modeling a wide range of plasma distributions, spanning analytically described smooth functions (e.g., Gaussian or exponential profiles), statistical models (e.g., turbulent screens), and discrete macroscopic structures like isolated plasma clumps, which are difficult to model both analytically and statistically. Validation tests demonstrate excellent agreement with established plasma propagation effects, such as dispersion, lensing, scintillation, and scattering. This code provides an efficient method for handling both analytical and statistical scenarios, bridging the gap between these descriptions. Thanks to its comprehensive capabilities, EMPI is particularly useful for studying radio sources with cosmological origin, especially pulse-like signals such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). As these signals travel through diverse and complex plasma environments across the universe, their properties are inevitably altered, resulting in observable changes. In this context, EMPI serves as a valuable tool for studying the propagation effects of these sources, helping to advance the understanding of their essence and the intervening plasma environments.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectral Variability as Probe of Multimessenger Emission in Blazar 5BZB J0630-24064</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations are essential for understanding the multimessenger emission mechanisms of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Blazars, a subset of AGN whose X-ray emission predominantly originates from relativistic jets, have been proposed as promising high-energy neutrino sources. In this work, we study the candidate neutrino-emitting blazar 5BZB J0630-24064, which has been observed over multiple epochs with the XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Neil Gehrels Swift-XRT, and eROSITA observatories. Analysis of the X-ray spectra in the 2.0-10.0 keV band shows significant variability, with high flux states adhering to a power-law model indicative of jet emission. However, during low-flux states, the spectrum reveals an additional component at hard-X-rays, indicating a transition from jet-dominated to multi-component X-ray emission, possibly associated with hadronic processes. To investigate this spectral evolution, we tested various models and found it to be consistent with corona emission or photoionised absorption processes typically observed in obscured AGN. The identification of the X-ray spectral variability in 5BZB J0630-24064, combined with its potential for neutrino production, opens new perspectives in multimessenger astrophysics of blazars highlighting the synergies between the mechanisms of the jet and the nuclear environment.</description>

      <title>Clustering analysis of Fermi-LAT unidentified point sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected thousands of sources since its launch in 2008, with many remaining unidentified. Some of these point sources may arise from source confusion. Specifically, there could be extended sources erroneously described as groups of point sources. Using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, we analyze unidentified Fermi-LAT sources alongside some classified objects from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog. We identified 44 distinct clusters containing 106 sources, each including at least one unidentified source. Detailed modeling of selected clusters reveals some cases where extended source models are statistically preferred over multiple point sources. The work is motivated by prior observations of extended TeV gamma-ray sources, such as HESS J1813-178, and their GeV counterparts. In the case of HESS J1813-178, two unidentified Fermi-LAT point sources were detected in the region. Subsequent multiwavelength analysis combining TeV and GeV data showed that a single extended source is a better description of the emission in this region than two point-like sources.</description>

      <title>The flat tail in the burst energy distribution of FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration radio transients of extra-galactic origin, whose underlying mechanisms and progenitors remain poorly understood. FRBs are broadly classified into two categories: repeating FRBs, which emit multiple bursts over time, and one-off FRBs, which are detected as single events. A central question in FRB research is whether these two classes share a common origin. In this study, we present observations of FRB 20240114A, a repeating FRB that entered a hyperactive phase in January 2024. We conducted a 318-hour monitoring campaign using the Kunming 40-Meter Radio Telescope (KM40M) in the S-band (2.187-2.311 GHz), during which we detected eight radio bursts. We analyzed their properties, including dispersion measure (DM), bandwidth, pulse width, flux, fluence, and energy. Additionally, we searched for counterparts in overlapping data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in the L-band (1.0-1.5 GHz). While no bursts were temporally aligned between the two telescopes, we identified one FAST burst that arrived approximately 6 ms after one of the KM40M bursts. The absence of FAST counterparts for the KM40M bursts suggests that individual bursts from FRB 20240114A are likely narrow-band, with fractional bandwidths less than 10%. By comparing the cumulative event rates from KM40M and FAST observations, we found that the two measurements are compatible, indicating a possible flattening of the event rate at higher energies. This feature aligns with observations of one-off FRBs, supporting the hypothesis that repeating and one-off FRBs may share a common origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple stellar systems, consisting of three gravitationally bound stars, play a fundamental role in a wide array of astrophysical processes, from stellar evolution to the formation of exotic objects and gravitational wave sources. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamics and evolution of triple stellar systems, highlighting their crucial role in shaping stellar populations and driving diverse astrophysical phenomena. We begin by discussing the observed properties of triples, including their frequency and orbital configurations, emphasizing the challenges in characterizing these systems. We then delve into the intricate dynamics of triples, exploring hierarchical, secular, quasi-secular, and chaotic regimes, with particular attention to the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism and its extensions. The interplay between stellar evolution and triple dynamics is examined, including mass loss, mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and supernovae effects. We discuss the development and applications of triple population synthesis codes, demonstrating their power in modeling complex evolutionary scenarios and predicting observational outcomes. Finally, we emphasize the unique role of triple evolution in producing a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from interacting binaries and stellar mergers to explosive transients and gravitational wave sources, underscoring the importance of triple systems in our understanding of stars and stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statistics of Solar Flares and Flare Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of interval times between recurrent discrete events, such as Solar and stellar flares, reflects their underlying dynamics. Log-normal functions provide good fits to the interval time distributions of many recurrent astronomical events. The width of the fit is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes its underlying dynamics, in analogy to the critical exponents of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as it often is over a wide range, then the width of the log-normal is independent of the detector sensitivity in that range, making it a robust metric. Analyzing two catalogues of Solar flares over periods ranging from 46 days to 37 years, we find that the widths of log-normal fits to the intervals between flares are wider than those of shot noise, indicating memory in the underlying dynamics even over a time much shorter than the Solar cycle. In contrast, the statistics of flare stars are consistent with shot noise (no memory). We suggest that this is a consequence of the production of Solar flares in localized transient active regions with varying mean flare rate, but that the very energetic flares of flare stars result from global magnetic rearrangement that reinitializes their magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Electron Penetration Acceleration in Turbulent Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using particle-in-cell simulations to study fast radio burst (FRB) propagation in a tenuous plasma, we identified a novel mechanism that occurs during the growth of turbulent magnetic loops: electron penetration acceleration. The loops have an electromagnetic left-hand chirality distinct from that of well-known quasistatic magnetic islands. The fast electrons penetrate through the loops and thus are accelerated to unexpected relativistic energies due to the symmetry breaking induced by the coupling between the loop field and the non-relativistic electromagnetic wave. The identified features of penetration acceleration and magnetic loops might provide a new perspective for understanding particle injection into relativistic collisionless shock precursors invoked in FRB-swept cosmic backgrounds. Additionally, we show that this FRB-relevant phenomenon could be tested in scaled laboratory experiments using a multi-terawatt laser impinging on gase targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In resistive and viscous magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we obtain axial outflows launched from the innermost magnetosphere of a star-disk system. The launched outflows are found to be asymmetric. We find the part of the parameter space corresponding to quasi-stationary axial outflows and compute the mass load and angular momentum flux in such outflows. We display the obtained geometry of the solutions and measure the speed of propagation and rotation of the obtained axial outflows.</description>

      <title>NucleiML: A machine learning framework of ground-state properties of finite nuclei for accelerated Bayesian exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global behavior of the nuclear equation of state (EoS) is usually investigated using finite nuclei (FN) data, along with constraints from heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations of neutron star (NS) properties. The FN constraints explicitly imposed through the binding energies and charge radii of selected nuclei are found to significantly affect the EoS across different densities. However, the high computational cost of these constraints makes it challenging to extend the analysis to a broader set of nuclei, particularly when the objective is not merely to obtain a single optimized model but to systematically explore uncertainties in global modeling. To overcome this challenge, we introduce NucleiML (NML), a machine learning framework trained on ground-state FN properties obtained from mean-field models. Integrated into a Bayesian inference approach, NML demonstrates high accuracy and strong consistency with the underlying mean-field model. The NML achieves around ten-fold computational speed-up, from $\sim 4.5$ hours to 30 minutes. Its predictive performance improves further as the number of nuclei in the training data increases, which we plan to employ in extensive future explorations.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) traversing the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be cooled through interactions with DM particles. In this study, we investigated constraints on sub-GeV DM particles charged under various $U(1)$ gauge symmetries by exploiting the cooling effect of CRs in AGNs. We find that for low DM and mediator masses, the CR cooling rate is higher compared to the standard model cooling process. Furthermore, by utilizing constraints from the CR cooling effect in NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, we explore the bounds on the DM-electron and DM-proton elastic scattering cross-sections. Our results indicate that in the sub-GeV DM mass range, these constraints are more stringent than those from certain boosted DM mechanisms and current direct detection limits.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropic dark energy with spatial curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of thermodynamics of apparent horizon, we construct a dark energy (DE) model from 4-parameter generalized entropy of apparent horizon in a spatially non-flat universe. In particular, considering a non-zero spatial curvature of the universe, we determine the dark energy fractional density and the dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter (corresponding to the 4-parameter generalized entropy) in closed analytic forms. It turns out that the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of the present Hubble parameter for a certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to a possible resolution of the Hubble tension issue. This in turn leads to a positive spatial curvature of the universe. We confront the scenario with CC \&amp; BAO, Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES and joint analysis of the CC \&amp; BAO \&amp; Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES datasets, which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent with the resolution of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Coupling hydrodynamics with comoving frame radiative transfer. III. The wind regime of early-type B hypergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. B hypergiants (BHGs) are important for understanding high-mass stellar evolution. While they are in a similar parameter space of B supergiants (BSGs), some BHGs are known to be luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their spectra with absorption and emission features resemble Of/WNh stars. Yet, their wind physics and their evolutionary connections are not clear. Aims. In this study, we aim to understand (i) the atmospheric and wind structure, (ii) the wind-launching and -driving mechanisms, and (iii) the spectrum formation of early-type BHGs. As an observational prototype, we use zet1 Sco (B1.5Ia+). Methods. Using the atmosphere code PoWRhd, we calculated the first hydrodynamically consistent models at the BHG domain. They give insights into the radiative driving of the calculated wind regimes and enable us to study the influence of clumping and X-rays on the resulting wind structure. Results. Our consistent model reproduces the main spectral features of zet1 Sco. The obtained mass-loss rate is higher than that of similar spectral type BSGs. However, the wind optical depth of BHGs is way below unity, making them less of a transition type. To reproduce zet1 Sco's spectrum, we needed low clumping with subsonic onset. The wind has a shallow-gradient velocity profile, deviating from the beta law, and is mainly driven by Fe III opacity. Conclusions. Our study suggests that despite more mass loss, early-type Galactic BHGs have winds relatively similar to BSGs. Their winds are not thick enough to characterize them as "transition-type" stars, unlike Of/WNh, implying that emission features arise more easily in cooler than in hotter stars. The spectral BHG appearance is likely connected to atmospheric inhomogeneities below the sonic point. To reach an appearance similar to LBVs, BHGs need to be either closer to the Eddington limit or have higher wind clumping than inferred for zeta1 Sco.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Detectable MeV Neutrino Signals from Neutron-Star Common-Envelope Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Common-envelope evolution - where a star is engulfed by a companion - is a critical but poorly understood step in, e.g., the formation pathways for gravitational-wave sources. However, it has been extremely challenging to identify observable signatures of such systems. We show that for systems involving a neutron star, the hypothesized super-Eddington accretion onto the neutron star produces MeV-range, months-long neutrino signals within reach of present and planned detectors. While there are substantial uncertainties on the rate of such events (0.01-1/century in the Milky Way) and the neutrino luminosity (which may be less than the accretion power), this signal can only be found if dedicated new analyses are developed. If detected, the neutrino signal would probe super-Eddington accretion, leading to significant new insights into the astrophysics of common-envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>Polarization Patterns of the Hotspots Plunging into a Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-wavelength polarized light signals from supermassive black holes have sparked many studies on polarized images of accretion disks and hotspots. However, the polarization patterns within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) region remain to be explored. In this study, we focus on two specific types of orbits, namely the plunging geodesics inward from the ISCO and homoclinic geodesics, to uncover the polarization features associated with non-circular motion in a Kerr spacetime. For an on-axis observer, we specifically develop an approximate function to describe gravitational lensing along the azimuthal direction and establish a simplified synchrotron emission model. Based on these, we analyze the time-integrated polarized images of hotspots and their Stokes parameters. Moreover, we explore the polarized image of the plunging region within a thin accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernova explosions hindered by eV-mass sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal fluctuations and number of muons at the ground in muon-depleted proton air showers at PeV energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon counting is an effective strategy for discriminating between gamma and hadron-initiated air showers. However, their detection, which requires shielded detectors, is highly expensive and challenging to implement across large, environmentally sensitive areas.
  This work allowed to establish for the first time that at PeV energies the gamma/hadron discriminator based on the new $LCm$ variable have proton rejection levels of the order of $10^{-4}$, outperforming the discrimination power based on the counting of the number of muons.
  A thorough examination of muon depleted showers at the PeV energies and the simulation strategy devised to achieve the required $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ simulated showers is presented.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Scale-Dependent Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study an Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS)-like gravitational collapse in the general framework of scale-dependent gravity. We explore the collapse in spherically symmetric solutions suggested both by asymptotically safe gravity (characterized by a positive $\om$-parameter) and by scale-dependent gravity (negative $\om$-parameter), when a singularity at a finite positive radial coordinate is developed. The inner geometry of the collapsing star is described, as usual, by a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, and matter is uniformly distributed without any assumptions about its equation of state. The outer asymptotically-safe/scale-dependent black hole metric is smoothly matched to the inner geometry, and this yields the equation of motion of the star surface, the energy density, pressure, and equation of state of the collapsing matter. We study in detail the proper-time evolution of the event and apparent horizons. Finally, the constraints of the energy conditions on the equation of state, and its properties, are considered and discussed.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on SIGW with Future Pulsar Timing Array Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>
