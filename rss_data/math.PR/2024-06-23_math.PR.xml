      <title>Theory of Stochastic Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studying randomized search heuristics, a frequent quantity of interest is the first time a (real-valued) stochastic process obtains (or passes) a certain value. The processes under investigation commonly show a bias towards this goal, the \emph{stochastic drift}. Turning an iteration-wise expected bias into a first time of obtaining a value is the main result of \emph{drift theorems}. This thesis introduces the theory of stochastic drift, providing examples and reviewing the main drift theorems available. Furthermore, the thesis explains how these methods can be applied in various contexts, including those where drift theorems seem a counterintuitive choice. Later sections examine related methods and approaches.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusive concentration for the chemical distance in Bernoulli percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering supercritical Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, Garet and Marchand [GM09] proved a diffusive concentration for the graph distance. In this paper, we sharpen this result by establishing the subdiffusive concentration inequality, which revisits the sublinear bound of the variance proved by Dembin [Dem22] as a consequence. Our approach is inspired by similar work in First-passage percolation [BR08, DHS14], combined with new tools to address the challenge posed by the infinite weight of the model. These tools, including the notion of effective radius and its properties, enable a simple one-step renormalization process as a systematic means of managing the effects of resampling edges.</description>

      <title>Zero-one laws for events with positional symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an information-theoretic argument due to O'Connell (2000) to prove that every sufficiently symmetric event concerning a countably infinite family of independent and identically distributed random variables is deterministic (i.e., has a probability of either 0 or 1). The i.i.d. condition can be relaxed. This result encompasses the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law and the ergodicity of the Bernoulli process, but also applies to other scenarios such as infinite random graphs and simple renormalization processes.</description>

      <title>Random walk in slowly changing environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Random Walk in Changing Environment (RWCE) is a weighted random walk on a locally finite, connected graph $G$ with random, time-dependent edge-weights. This includes self-interacting random walks, where the edge-weights depend on the history of the process. In general, even the basic question of recurrence or transience for RWCEs is difficult, especially when the underlying graph contains cycles. In this note, we derive a condition for recurrence or transience that is too restrictive for classical RWCEs but instead works for any graph $G.$ Namely, we show that any bounded RWCE on $G$ with "slowly" changing edge-weights inherits the recurrence or transience of the initial weighted graph.</description>

      <title>Tails of explosive birth processes and applications to non-linear P \'{o}lya urns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a simple expression for the tail-asymptotics of an explosive birth process at a fixed observation time conditioned on non-explosion. Using the well-established exponential embedding, we apply this result to compute the tail distribution of the number of balls of a losing colour in generalized P \'{o}lya urn models with super-linear feedback, which are known to exhibit a strong monopoly for the winning colour where losers only win a finite amount. Previous results in this direction were restricted to two colours with the same feedback, which we extend to an arbitrary finite number of colours with individual feedback mechanisms. As an apparent paradox, losing colours with weak feedback are more likely to win in many steps than those with strong feedback. Our approach also allows to characterize the correlations of several losing colours, which provides new insight in the distribution of other related quantities like the total number of balls for losing colours or the time to monopoly. In order to give a complete picture, we also consider sub-linear feedback and discuss asymptotics for a diverging number of colours.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for the quenched survival probability of a supercritical branching random walk in random environment with a barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a random barrier to a supercritical branching random walk in an i.i.d. random environment $\{\mathcal{L}_n\}$ indexed by time $n,$ i.e., in each generation, only the individuals born below the barrier can survive and reproduce. At generation $n$ ($n\in\mathbb{N}$), the barrier is set as $\chi_n+\varepsilon n,$ where $\{\chi_n\}$ is a random walk determined by the random environment. Lv \&amp; Hong (2024) showed that for almost every $\mathcal{L}:=\{\mathcal{L}_n\},$ the quenched survival probability (denoted by $\varrho_{\mathcal{L}}(\varepsilon)$) of the particles system will be 0 (resp., positive) when $\varepsilon\leq 0$ (resp., $\varepsilon&gt;0$). In the present paper, we prove that $\sqrt{\varepsilon}\log\varrho_\mathcal{L}(\varepsilon)$ will converge in Probability/ almost surely/ in $L^p$ to an explicit negative constant (depending on the environment) as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$ under some integrability conditions respectively. This result extends the scope of the result of Gantert et al. (2011) to the random environment case.</description>

      <title>A Law Limit Theorem for a sequence of random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An application of Levy's continuity theorem and Hankel transform allow us to establish a law limit theorem for the sequence $V_n=f(U)\sin(n U)$, where $U$ is uniformly distributed in $(0,1)$ and $f$ a given function. Further, we investigate the inverse problem by specifying a limit distribution and look for the suitable function $f$ ensuring the convergence in law to the specified distribution. Our work recovers and extends existing similar works, in particular we make it possible to sample from known laws including Gaussian and Cauchy distributions.</description>

      <title>Critical point representation of the mutual information in the sparse stochastic block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the community structure in the stochastic block model. We aim to describe the mutual information between the observed network and the actual community structure as the number of nodes diverges while the average degree of a given node remains bounded. Our main contribution is a representation of the limit of this quantity, assuming it exists, as an explicit functional evaluated at a critical point of that functional. While we mostly focus on the two-community setting for clarity, we expect our method to be robust to model generalizations. We also present an example involving four communities where we show the invalidity of a plausible candidate variational formula for this limit.</description>

      <title>The incipient infinite cluster of the FK-Ising model in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and the susceptibility of the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the critical FK-Ising measure $\phi_{\beta_c}$ on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$. We construct the measure $\phi^\infty:=\lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty}\phi_{\beta_c}[\:\cdot\: |\: 0\leftrightarrow x]$ and prove it satisfies $\phi^\infty[0\leftrightarrow \infty]=1$. This corresponds to the natural candidate for the incipient infinite cluster measure of the FK-Ising model. Our proof uses a result of Lupu and Werner (Electron. Commun. Probab., 2016) that relates the FK-Ising model to the random current representation of the Ising model, together with a mixing property of random currents recently established by Aizenman and Duminil-Copin (Ann. Math., 2021). We then study the susceptibility $\chi(\beta)$ of the nearest-neighbour Ising model on $\mathbb Z^d$. When $d&gt;4$, we improve a previous result of Aizenman (Comm. Math. Phys., 1982) to obtain the existence of $A&gt;0$ such that, for $\beta&lt;\beta_c$, \begin{equation*}
  \chi(\beta)= \frac{A}{1-\beta/\beta_c}(1+o(1)), \end{equation*} where $o(1)$ tends to $0$ as $\beta$ tends to $\beta_c$. Additionally, we relate the constant $A$ to the incipient infinite cluster of the double random current.</description>

      <title>On maximizing the number of heads when you need to set aside at least one coin every round</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: You play the following game: you start out with $n$ coins that all have probability $p$ to land heads. You toss all of them and you then need to set aside at least one of them, which will not be tossed again. Now you repeat the process with the remaining coins. This continues (for at most $n$ rounds) until all coins have been set aside. Your goal is to maximize the total number of heads you end up with. In this paper we will prove that there exists a constant $p_0 \approx 0.5495021777642$ such that, if $p_0 &lt; p \le 1$ and the number of remaining coins is large enough, then it is optimal to set aside exactly one coin every round, unless all coins landed heads. When $\frac{1}{2} \le p \le p_0$, it is optimal to aside exactly one coin every round, unless at most one coin came up tails. Let $v_{n,p}$ be the expected number of heads you obtain when using the optimal strategy. We will show that $v_{n,p}$ is larger than or equal to $v_{n-1,p} + 1$ for all $n \ge 3$ and all $p \ge \frac{1}{2}$. When $p &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ there are infinitely many $n$ for which this inequality does not hold. Finally, we will see that for every $p$ with $0 &lt; p \le 1$ the sequence $n - v_{n,p}$ is convergent.</description>

      <title>Multivariate extreme values for dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a theory for multivariate extreme value analysis of dynamical systems. Namely, we provide conditions adapted to the dynamical setting which enable the study of dependence between extreme values of the components of $\R^d$-valued observables evaluated along the orbits of the systems. We study this cross-sectional dependence, which results from the combination of a spatial and a temporal dependence structures. We give several illustrative applications, where concrete systems and dependence sources are introduced and analysed.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein convergence of \v{C}ech persistence diagrams for samplings of submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \v{C}ech Persistence diagrams (PDs) are topological descriptors routinely used to capture the geometry of complex datasets. They are commonly compared using the Wasserstein distances $OT_{p}$; however, the extent to which PDs are stable with respect to these metrics remains poorly understood. We partially close this gap by focusing on the case where datasets are sampled on an $m$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Under this manifold hypothesis, we show that convergence with respect to the $OT_{p}$ metric happens exactly when $p\gt m$. We also provide improvements upon the bottleneck stability theorem in this case and prove new laws of large numbers for the total $\alpha$-persistence of PDs. Finally, we show how these theoretical findings shed new light on the behavior of the feature maps on the space of PDs that are used in ML-oriented applications of Topological Data Analysis.</description>

      <title>On Naive Mean-Field Approximation for high-dimensional canonical GLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the validity of the Naive Mean Field (NMF) approximation for canonical GLMs with product priors. This setting is challenging due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood and the prior. Using the theory of non-linear large deviations (Austin 2019, Chatterjee, Dembo 2016, Eldan 2018), we derive sufficient conditions for the tightness of the NMF approximation to the log-normalizing constant of the posterior distribution. As a second contribution, we establish that under minor conditions on the design, any NMF optimizer is a product distribution where each component is a quadratic tilt of the prior. In turn, this suggests novel iterative algorithms for fitting the NMF optimizer to the target posterior. Finally, we establish that if the NMF optimization problem has a "well-separated maximizer", then this optimizer governs the probabilistic properties of the posterior. Specifically, we derive credible intervals with average coverage guarantees, and characterize the prediction performance on an out-of-sample datapoint in terms of this dominant optimizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the KPZ equation on a torus with a $1+1$ spacetime white noise, it was shown in \cite{GK21,ADYGTK22} that the height function satisfies a central limit theorem, and the variance can be written as the expectation of an exponential functional of Brownian bridges. In this paper, we consider another physically relevant quantity, the winding number of the directed polymer on a cylinder, or equivalently, the displacement of the directed polymer endpoint in a spatially periodic random environment. It was shown in \cite{YGTK22} that the polymer endpoint satisfies a central limit theorem on diffusive scales. The main result of this paper is an explicit expression of the effective diffusivity, in terms of the expectation of another exponential functional of Brownian bridges. Our argument is based on a combination of tools from Malliavin calculus, homogenization, and diffusion in distribution-valued random environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short note aims at complementing the results of the recent work arXiv:2302.05396, where Jahnel and L\"uchtrath investigate the question of existence of a subcritical percolation phase for the annulus-crossing probabilities in a large class of continuum percolation models, namely the classical or generalized weight-dependent random connection models. Their work relates the absence of a subcritical phase to the occurrence of long edges in the graph, through a somewhat indirect criterium, that stays inconclusive in some models of interest. We provide a more direct and arguably simpler criterium, that is always conclusive when considering classical weight-dependent random connection models.</description>

Abstract: We show that the $i$-dimensional plaqutte random-cluster model with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ is dual to a $(d-i)$-dimensional plaquette random cluster model. In addition, we explore boundary conditions, infinite volume limits, and uniqueness for these models.

      <title>On the block size spectrum of the multiplicative Beta coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the dynamic $\Lambda$-random graph and the associated multiplicative $\Lambda$-coalescent. The dynamic $\Lambda$-random graph is an exchangeable and consistent random graph process, inspired by the classical $\Lambda$-coalescent studied in mathematical population genetics. Our main concern is the multiplicative $\Lambda$-coalescent, which accounts for the connected components (blocks) of the graph. This process is exchangeable but not consistent. We focus on the case where $\Lambda$ is the beta measure and prove a dynamic law of large numbers for the block size spectrum, which tracks the numbers of blocks containing $1,...,d$ elements. On top of that, we provide a functional limit theorem for the fluctuations around its deterministic trajectory. The limit process satisfies a stochastic differential equation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.</description>

      <title>Small-time approximation of the transition density for diffusions with singularities. Application to the Wright-Fisher model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher (W-F) diffusion model serves as a foundational framework for interpreting population evolution through allele frequency dynamics over time. Despite the known transition probability between consecutive generations, an exact analytical expression for the transition density at arbitrary time intervals remains elusive. Commonly utilized distributions such as Gaussian or Beta inadequately address the fixation issue at extreme allele frequencies (0 or 1), particularly for short periods. In this study, we introduce two alternative parametric functions, namely the Asymptotic Expansion (AE) and the Gaussian approximation (GaussA), derived through probabilistic methodologies, aiming to better approximate this density. The AE function provides a suitable density for allele frequency distributions, encompassing extreme values within the interval [0,1]. Additionally, we outline the range of validity for the GaussA approximation. While our primary focus is on W-F diffusion, we demonstrate how our findings extend to other diffusion models featuring singularities. Through simulations of allele frequencies under a W-F process and employing a recently developed adaptive density estimation method, we conduct a comparative analysis to assess the fit of the proposed densities against the Beta and Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>A non-backtracking method for long matrix and tensor completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02077v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of low-rank rectangular matrix completion in the regime where the matrix $M$ of size $n\times m$ is ``long", i.e., the aspect ratio $m/n$ diverges to infinity. Such matrices are of particular interest in the study of tensor completion, where they arise from the unfolding of a low-rank tensor. In the case where the sampling probability is $\frac{d}{\sqrt{mn}}$, we propose a new spectral algorithm for recovering the singular values and left singular vectors of the original matrix $M$ based on a variant of the standard non-backtracking operator of a suitably defined bipartite weighted random graph, which we call a \textit{non-backtracking wedge operator}. When $d$ is above a Kesten-Stigum-type sampling threshold, our algorithm recovers a correlated version of the singular value decomposition of $M$ with quantifiable error bounds. This is the first result in the regime of bounded $d$ for weak recovery and the first for weak consistency when $d\to\infty$ arbitrarily slowly without any polylog factors. As an application, for low-CP-rank orthogonal $k$-tensor completion, we efficiently achieve weak recovery with sample size $O(n^{k/2})$ and weak consistency with sample size $\omega(n^{k/2})$. A similar result is obtained for low-multilinear-rank tensor completion with $O(n^{k/2})$ many samples.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Resolvability, Noise Stability, and Anti-contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As indicated by the title, this paper investigates three closely related topics -- R\'enyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R\'enyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R\'enyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R\'enyi parameter in $[0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$ was studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R\'enyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. We then connect the R\'enyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that the $q$-stability of a set can be expressed in terms of the R\'enyi divergence between the true output distribution and the target distribution in a variant of the R\'enyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the $q$-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where anti-contractivity introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of Hilbert space-valued linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs), generalizing the classic LQ mean field game theory to scenarios involving $N$ agent whose dynamics are governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both the state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. Moreoever, all agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent also involves the state, control, and the average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ general coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations, which forms the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. Subsequently, we address the limiting Hilbert space-valued MFG as the number of agents approaches infinity and develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle. We characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting model and demonstrate that the associated best-response strategies constitute an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the original $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of noisy SVGD outside the population limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a widely used sampling algorithm that has been successfully applied in several areas of Machine Learning. SVGD operates by iteratively moving a set of  interacting particles (which represent the samples) to approximate the target distribution. Despite recent studies on the complexity of SVGD and its variants, their long-time asymptotic behavior (i.e., after numerous iterations ) is still not understood in the finite number of particles regime. We study the long-time asymptotic behavior of a noisy variant of SVGD. First, we establish that the limit set of noisy SVGD for large  is well-defined. We then characterize this limit set, showing that it approaches the target distribution as  increases. In particular, noisy SVGD provably avoids the variance collapse observed for SVGD. Our approach involves demonstrating that the trajectories of noisy SVGD closely resemble those described by a McKean-Vlasov process.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>
