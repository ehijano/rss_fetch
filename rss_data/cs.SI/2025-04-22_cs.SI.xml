      <title>A Model of Silence, or the Probability of "Un Ange Passe"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In French, the phrase "Un ange passe" ("An angel passes") refers to the sudden silence that falls over a co-present group -- that is, a group of people sharing the same physical space. As evidenced by the presence of similar expressions across languages and cultures, this phenomenon represents a universal feature of human conversation. At the same time, the meaning attributed to silence can differ greatly across national, cultural, and interpersonal contexts. Consequently, a wide range of studies have focused on the impact of silence on organizational productivity, its relationship to ideas and creativity, and its potential effectiveness in medical settings. Despite the important role that silence plays, very few studies have attempted to characterize its features using mathematical modeling. In this study, we propose a Markov chain model to describe the dynamics of silence in a co-present group and attempt to analyze its behavior. Our results reveal a phase-transition-like phenomenon, where the probability of silence abruptly drops to zero once individuals' awareness of the surrounding conversation falls below a critical threshold. In other words, such silence can emerge only when individuals retain a minimal degree of mutual awareness of those around them. The model proposed in this study not only offers a deeper understanding of conversational dynamics, but also holds potential for contributing to intercultural communication, organizational productivity, and medical practice.</description>

      <title>Writing Patterns Reveal a Hidden Division of Labor in Scientific Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recognition of individual contributions is central to the scientific reward system, yet coauthored papers often obscure who did what. Traditional proxies like author order assume a simplistic decline in contribution, while emerging practices such as self-reported roles are biased and limited in scope. We introduce a large-scale, behavior-based approach to identifying individual contributions in scientific papers. Using author-specific LaTeX macros as writing signatures, we analyze over 730,000 arXiv papers (1991-2023), covering over half a million scientists. Validated against self-reports, author order, disciplinary norms, and Overleaf records, our method reliably infers author-level writing activity. Section-level traces reveal a hidden division of labor: first authors focus on technical sections (e.g., Methods, Results), while last authors primarily contribute to conceptual sections (e.g., Introduction, Discussion). Our findings offer empirical evidence of labor specialization at scale and new tools to improve credit allocation in collaborative research.</description>

      <title>Tracking mob Dynamics in online social networks Using epidemiology model based on Mobility Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, social media is the main tool in our new lives. The outbreak news and all related obtained from social media, and mob events affect the of spread these news fast. Recently, epidemiological models to study disease spread and analyze the behavior of mob groups by dealing with "contagions" that propagate through user networks. In this research, we introduced a mathematical model to analyze social behavior related to COVID-19 spread by examining Twitter activity from April 2020 to June 2020. The main feature of this model is the integration of mobility dynamics that be derived from the above real data, to adjust the rate of outbreak based on the response of social interactions. Consider mobility as a parameter of time-varying, and fluctuations in the rate of contact that is driven by factors like personal behavior or external affecting such as "lockdown" and "quarantine" etc., to track public sentiment and engagement trends during the pandemic. The threshold number is derived, and the existence of bifurcation and the stability of the steady states are established. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of relevant parameters are also carried out.</description>

      <title>Information Diffusion and Preferential Attachment in a Network of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper models information diffusion in a network of Large Language Models (LLMs) that is designed to answer queries from distributed datasets, where the LLMs can hallucinate the answer. We introduce a two-time-scale dynamical model for the centrally administered network, where opinions evolve faster while the network's degree distribution changes more slowly. Using a mean-field approximation, we establish conditions for a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium where all LLMs remain truthful. We provide approximation guarantees for the mean-field approximation and a singularly perturbed approximation of the two-time-scale system. To mitigate hallucination and improve the influence of truthful nodes, we propose a reputation-based preferential attachment mechanism that reconfigures the network based on LLMs' evaluations of their neighbors. Numerical experiments on an open-source LLM (LLaMA-3.1-8B) validate the efficacy of our preferential attachment mechanism and demonstrate the optimization of a cost function for the two-time-scale system.</description>

      <title>How Local Separators Shape Community Structure in Large Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is a key tool for analyzing the structure of large networks. Standard methods, such as modularity optimization, focus on identifying densely connected groups but often overlook natural local separations in the graph. In this paper, we investigate local separator methods, which decompose networks based on structural bottlenecks rather than global connectivity. We systematically compare them with well-established community detection algorithms on large real-world networks. Our results show that local 1-separators consistently identify the densest communities, outperforming modularity-based methods in this regard, while local 2-separators reveal hierarchical structures but may over-fragment small clusters. These findings are particularly strong for road networks, suggesting practical applications in transportation and infrastructure analysis. Our study highlights local separators as a scalable and interpretable alternative for network decomposition.</description>

      <title>VLM as Policy: Common-Law Content Moderation Framework for Short Video Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponentially growing short video platforms (SVPs) face significant challenges in moderating content detrimental to users' mental health, particularly for minors. The dissemination of such content on SVPs can lead to catastrophic societal consequences. Although substantial efforts have been dedicated to moderating such content, existing methods suffer from critical limitations: (1) Manual review is prone to human bias and incurs high operational costs. (2) Automated methods, though efficient, lack nuanced content understanding, resulting in lower accuracy. (3) Industrial moderation regulations struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving trends due to long update cycles. In this paper, we annotate the first SVP content moderation benchmark with authentic user/reviewer feedback to fill the absence of benchmark in this field. Then we evaluate various methods on the benchmark to verify the existence of the aforementioned limitations. We further propose our common-law content moderation framework named KuaiMod to address these challenges. KuaiMod consists of three components: training data construction, offline adaptation, and online deployment &amp; refinement. Leveraging large vision language model (VLM) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, KuaiMod adequately models video toxicity based on sparse user feedback and fosters dynamic moderation policy with rapid update speed and high accuracy. Offline experiments and large-scale online A/B test demonstrates the superiority of KuaiMod: KuaiMod achieves the best moderation performance on our benchmark. The deployment of KuaiMod reduces the user reporting rate by 20% and its application in video recommendation increases both Daily Active User (DAU) and APP Usage Time (AUT) on several Kuaishou scenarios. We have open-sourced our benchmark at https://kuaimod.github.io.</description>

      <title>Rhythm of Opinion: A Hawkes-Graph Framework for Dynamic Propagation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of social media has significantly reshaped the dynamics of public opinion, resulting in complex interactions that traditional models fail to effectively capture. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with Graph Neural Network, modeling opinion propagation dynamics among nodes in a social network while considering the intricate hierarchical relationships between comments. The extended multi-dimensional Hawkes process captures the hierarchical structure, multi-dimensional interactions, and mutual influences across different topics, forming a complex propagation network. Moreover, recognizing the lack of high-quality datasets capable of comprehensively capturing the evolution of public opinion dynamics, we introduce a new dataset, VISTA. It includes 159 trending topics, corresponding to 47,207 posts, 327,015 second-level comments, and 29,578 third-level comments, covering diverse domains such as politics, entertainment, sports, health, and medicine. The dataset is annotated with detailed sentiment labels across 11 categories and clearly defined hierarchical relationships. When combined with our method, it offers strong interpretability by linking sentiment propagation to the comment hierarchy and temporal evolution. Our approach provides a robust baseline for future research.</description>

      <title>Beyond Binary Opinions: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach to Uncertainty-Aware Competitive Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) problem involves multiple entities competing for influence in online social networks (OSNs). While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise, existing methods often assume users' opinions are binary and ignore their behavior and prior knowledge. We propose DRIM, a multi-dimensional uncertainty-aware DRL-based CIM framework that leverages Subjective Logic (SL) to model uncertainty in user opinions, preferences, and DRL decision-making. DRIM introduces an Uncertainty-based Opinion Model (UOM) for a more realistic representation of user uncertainty and optimizes seed selection for propagating true information while countering false information. In addition, it quantifies uncertainty in balancing exploration and exploitation. Results show that UOM significantly enhances true information spread and maintains influence against advanced false information strategies. DRIM-based CIM schemes outperform state-of-the-art methods by up to 57% and 88% in influence while being up to 48% and 77% faster. Sensitivity analysis indicates that higher network observability and greater information propagation boost performance, while high network activity mitigates the effect of users' initial biases.</description>

      <title>An experimental study of the influence of anonymous information on social media users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and as a source of information, even though much of this information is practically anonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its recipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a nationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the answer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase, each participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four opinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are randomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked to revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from repeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions. Results were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous comments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion selections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing the selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM results suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such information. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can have a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their popularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when recipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found that participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the number of change opinions.</description>

      <title>A Graph Theoretic Approach for Exploring the Relationship between EV Adoption and Charging Infrastructure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing global demand for conventional energy has led to significant challenges, particularly due to rising CO2 emissions and the depletion of natural resources. In the U.S., light-duty vehicles contribute significantly to transportation sector emissions, prompting a global shift toward electrified vehicles (EVs). Among the challenges that thwart the widespread adoption of EVs is the insufficient charging infrastructure (CI). This study focuses on exploring the complex relationship between EV adoption and CI growth. Employing a graph theoretic approach, we propose a graph model to analyze correlations between EV adoption and CI growth across 137 counties in six states. We examine how different time granularities impact these correlations in two distinct scenarios: Early Adoption and Late Adoption. Further, we conduct causality tests to assess the directional relationship between EV adoption and CI growth in both scenarios. Our main findings reveal that analysis using lower levels of time granularity result in more homogeneous clusters, with notable differences between clusters in EV adoption and those in CI growth. Additionally, we identify causal relationships between EV adoption and CI growth in 137 counties, and show that causality is observed more frequently in Early Adoption scenarios than in Late Adoption ones. However, the causal effects in Early Adoption are slower than those in Late Adoption.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Conspiratorial Narratives within Arabic Online Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the spread of conspiracy theories in Arabic digital spaces through computational analysis of online content. By combining Named Entity Recognition and Topic Modeling techniques, specifically the Top2Vec algorithm, we analyze data from Arabic blogs and Facebook to identify and classify conspiratorial narratives. Our analysis uncovers six distinct categories: gender/feminist, geopolitical, government cover-ups, apocalyptic, Judeo-Masonic, and geoengineering. The research highlights how these narratives are deeply embedded in Arabic social media discourse, shaped by regional historical, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts. By applying advanced Natural Language Processing methods to Arabic content, this study addresses a gap in conspiracy theory research, which has traditionally focused on English-language content or offline data. The findings provide new insights into the manifestation and evolution of conspiracy theories in Arabic digital spaces, enhancing our understanding of their role in shaping public discourse in the Arab world.</description>

      <title>Matrix Factorization with Dynamic Multi-view Clustering for Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix factorization (MF), a cornerstone of recommender systems, decomposes user-item interaction matrices into latent representations. Traditional MF approaches, however, employ a two-stage, non-end-to-end paradigm, sequentially performing recommendation and clustering, resulting in prohibitive computational costs for large-scale applications like e-commerce and IoT, where billions of users interact with trillions of items. To address this, we propose Matrix Factorization with Dynamic Multi-view Clustering (MFDMC), a unified framework that balances efficient end-to-end training with comprehensive utilization of web-scale data and enhances interpretability. MFDMC leverages dynamic multi-view clustering to learn user and item representations, adaptively pruning poorly formed clusters. Each entity's representation is modeled as a weighted projection of robust clusters, capturing its diverse roles across views. This design maximizes representation space utilization, improves interpretability, and ensures resilience for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate MFDMC's superior performance in recommender systems and other representation learning domains, such as computer vision, highlighting its scalability and versatility.</description>

      <title>Telegram as a Battlefield: Kremlin-related Communications during the Russia-Ukraine Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Telegram emerged as a crucial platform for both parties during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Per its minimal policies for content moderation, Pro-Kremlin narratives and potential misinformation were spread on Telegram, while anti-Kremlin narratives with related content were also propagated, such as war footage, troop movements, maps of bomb shelters, and air raid warnings. This paper presents a dataset of posts from both pro-Kremlin and anti-Kremlin Telegram channels, collected over a period spanning a year before and a year after the Russian invasion. The dataset comprises 404 pro-Kremlin channels with 4,109,645 posts and 114 anti-Kremlin channels with 1,117,768 posts. We provide details on the data collection process, processing methods, and dataset characterization. Lastly, we discuss the potential research opportunities this dataset may enable researchers across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>FROG: Effective Friend Recommendation in Online Games via Modality-aware User Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (e.g., images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model FROG that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at Tencent have demonstrated the superiority of FROG over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>TrustMap: Mapping Truthfulness Stance of Social Media Posts on Factual Claims for Geographical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factual claims and misinformation circulate widely on social media and affect how people form opinions and make decisions. This paper presents a truthfulness stance map (TrustMap), an application that identifies and maps public stances toward factual claims across U.S. regions. Each social media post is classified as positive, negative, or neutral/no stance, based on whether it believes a factual claim is true or false, expresses uncertainty about the truthfulness, or does not explicitly take a position on the claim's truthfulness. The tool uses a retrieval-augmented model with fine-tuned language models for automatic stance classification. The stance classification results and social media posts are grouped by location to show how stance patterns vary geographically. TrustMap allows users to explore these patterns by claim and region and connects stance detection with geographical analysis to better understand public engagement with factual claims.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to jointly denoise the features and rewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However, grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming, joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from which their implementation can commence.</description>

      <title>Emotion Alignment: Discovering the Gap Between Social Media and Real-World Sentiments in Persian Tweets and Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contemporary society, widespread social media usage is evident in people's daily lives. Nevertheless, disparities in emotional expressions between the real world and online platforms can manifest. We comprehensively analyzed Persian community on X to explore this phenomenon. An innovative pipeline was designed to measure the similarity between emotions in the real world compared to social media. Accordingly, recent tweets and images of participants were gathered and analyzed using Transformers-based text and image sentiment analysis modules. Each participant's friends also provided insights into the their real-world emotions. A distance criterion was used to compare real-world feelings with virtual experiences. Our study encompassed N=105 participants, 393 friends who contributed their perspectives, over 8,300 collected tweets, and 2,000 media images. Results indicated a 28.67% similarity between images and real-world emotions, while tweets exhibited a 75.88% alignment with real-world feelings. Additionally, the statistical significance confirmed that the observed disparities in sentiment proportions.</description>
