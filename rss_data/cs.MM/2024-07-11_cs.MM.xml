      <title>Spiking Tucker Fusion Transformer for Audio-Visual Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spiking neural networks (SNNs) that efficiently encode temporal sequences have shown great potential in extracting audio-visual joint feature representations. However, coupling SNNs (binary spike sequences) with transformers (float-point sequences) to jointly explore the temporal-semantic information still facing challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel Spiking Tucker Fusion Transformer (STFT) for audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL). The STFT leverage the temporal and semantic information from different time steps to generate robust representations. The time-step factor (TSF) is introduced to dynamically synthesis the subsequent inference information. To guide the formation of input membrane potentials and reduce the spike noise, we propose a global-local pooling (GLP) which combines the max and average pooling operations. Furthermore, the thresholds of the spiking neurons are dynamically adjusted based on semantic and temporal cues. Integrating the temporal and semantic information extracted by SNNs and Transformers are difficult due to the increased number of parameters in a straightforward bilinear model. To address this, we introduce a temporal-semantic Tucker fusion module, which achieves multi-scale fusion of SNN and Transformer outputs while maintaining full second-order interactions. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving state-of-the-art performance in three benchmark datasets. The harmonic mean (HM) improvement of VGGSound, UCF101 and ActivityNet are around 15.4\%, 3.9\%, and 14.9\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Label-anticipated Event Disentanglement for Audio-Visual Video Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to detect and temporally locate events within audio and visual modalities. Multiple events can overlap in the timeline, making identification challenging. While traditional methods usually focus on improving the early audio-visual encoders to embed more effective features, the decoding phase -- crucial for final event classification, often receives less attention. We aim to advance the decoding phase and improve its interpretability. Specifically, we introduce a new decoding paradigm, \underline{l}abel s\underline{e}m\underline{a}ntic-based \underline{p}rojection (LEAP), that employs labels texts of event categories, each bearing distinct and explicit semantics, for parsing potentially overlapping events.LEAP works by iteratively projecting encoded latent features of audio/visual segments onto semantically independent label embeddings. This process, enriched by modeling cross-modal (audio/visual-label) interactions, gradually disentangles event semantics within video segments to refine relevant label embeddings, guaranteeing a more discriminative and interpretable decoding process. To facilitate the LEAP paradigm, we propose a semantic-aware optimization strategy, which includes a novel audio-visual semantic similarity loss function. This function leverages the Intersection over Union of audio and visual events (EIoU) as a novel metric to calibrate audio-visual similarities at the feature level, accommodating the varied event densities across modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance for AVVP and also enhancing the relevant audio-visual event localization task.</description>

      <title>Enhancing context models for point cloud geometry compression with context feature residuals and multi-loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In point cloud geometry compression, context models usually use the one-hot encoding of node occupancy as the label, and the cross-entropy between the one-hot encoding and the probability distribution predicted by the context model as the loss function. However, this approach has two main weaknesses. First, the differences between contexts of different nodes are not significant, making it difficult for the context model to accurately predict the probability distribution of node occupancy. Second, as the one-hot encoding is not the actual probability distribution of node occupancy, the cross-entropy loss function is inaccurate. To address these problems, we propose a general structure that can enhance existing context models. We introduce the context feature residuals into the context model to amplify the differences between contexts. We also add a multi-layer perception branch, that uses the mean squared error between its output and node occupancy as a loss function to provide accurate gradients in backpropagation. We validate our method by showing that it can improve the performance of an octree-based model (OctAttention) and a voxel-based model (VoxelDNN) on the object point cloud datasets MPEG 8i and MVUB, as well as the LiDAR point cloud dataset SemanticKITTI.</description>

      <title>Enhancing octree-based context models for point cloud geometry compression with attention-based child node number prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In point cloud geometry compression, most octreebased context models use the cross-entropy between the onehot encoding of node occupancy and the probability distribution predicted by the context model as the loss. This approach converts the problem of predicting the number (a regression problem) and the position (a classification problem) of occupied child nodes into a 255-dimensional classification problem. As a result, it fails to accurately measure the difference between the one-hot encoding and the predicted probability distribution. We first analyze why the cross-entropy loss function fails to accurately measure the difference between the one-hot encoding and the predicted probability distribution. Then, we propose an attention-based child node number prediction (ACNP) module to enhance the context models. The proposed module can predict the number of occupied child nodes and map it into an 8- dimensional vector to assist the context model in predicting the probability distribution of the occupancy of the current node for efficient entropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module enhances the coding efficiency of octree-based context models.</description>

      <title>MuDiT &amp; MuSiT: Alignment with Colloquial Expression in Description-to-Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amid the rising intersection of generative AI and human artistic processes, this study probes the critical yet less-explored terrain of alignment in human-centric automatic song composition. We propose a novel task of Colloquial Description-to-Song Generation, which focuses on aligning the generated content with colloquial human expressions. This task is aimed at bridging the gap between colloquial language understanding and auditory expression within an AI model, with the ultimate goal of creating songs that accurately satisfy human auditory expectations and structurally align with musical norms. Current datasets are limited due to their narrow descriptive scope, semantic gaps and inaccuracies. To overcome data scarcity in this domain, we present the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD). CaiMD is manually annotated by both professional musicians and amateurs, offering diverse perspectives and a comprehensive understanding of colloquial descriptions. Unlike existing datasets pre-set with expert annotations or auto-generated ones with inherent biases, CaiMD caters more sufficiently to our purpose of aligning AI-generated music with widespread user-desired results. Moreover, we propose an innovative single-stage framework called MuDiT/MuSiT for enabling effective human-machine alignment in song creation. This framework not only achieves cross-modal comprehension between colloquial language and auditory music perceptions but also ensures generated songs align with user-desired results. MuDiT/MuSiT employs one DiT/SiT model for end-to-end generation of musical components like melody, harmony, rhythm, vocals, and instrumentation. The approach ensures harmonious sonic cohesiveness amongst all generated musical components, facilitating better resonance with human auditory expectations.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Enhancement by Integrating Inter-Channel and Band Features with Dual-branch Conformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer have been demonstrated to efficaciously capture time-frequency (T-F) information on spectrogram. However, the correlation of each channels of speech features is failed to explore. Theoretically, each channel map of speech features obtained by different convolution kernels contains information with different scales demonstrating strong correlations. To fill this gap, we propose a novel dual-branch architecture named channel-aware dual-branch conformer (CADB-Conformer), which effectively explores the long range time and frequency correlations among different channels, respectively, to extract channel relation aware time-frequency information. Ablation studies conducted on DNS-Challenge 2020 dataset demonstrate the importance of channel feature leveraging while showing the significance of channel relation aware T-F information for speech enhancement. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed model achieves superior performance than recent methods with an attractive computational costs.</description>

      <title>SaMoye: Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion Based on Feature Disentanglement and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice in a given music piece to another singer while keeping the original content. We propose an end-to-end feature disentanglement-based model, which we named SaMoye, to enable zero-shot many-to-many singing voice conversion. SaMoye disentangles the features of the singing voice into content features, timbre features, and pitch features respectively. The content features are enhanced using a GPT-based model to perform cross-prediction with the phoneme of the lyrics. SaMoye can generate the music with converted voice by replacing the timbre features with the target singer. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance. The dataset consists of 1500k pure singing vocal clips containing at least 10,000 singers.</description>
