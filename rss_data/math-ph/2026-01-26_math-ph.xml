      <title>Generalisation of Bureau-Guillot systems with Painlev\'e transcendents in the coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a generalisation of what we call Bureau-Guillot systems, i.e. systems of first order equations with coefficient functions being Painlev\'e transcendents. The same Painlev\'e equation is related to the system and it appears as regularising condition in the regularisation process. The systems considered are birationally equivalent to the Okamoto polynomial Hamiltonian systems with rational coefficients for Painlev\'e equations, hence they possess the Painlev\'e property. This work extends the results of Bureau-Guillot in a two-fold way. On one side, we consider polynomial systems with degree larger than 2 that are free of movable critical points. These systems contain not only transcendents $\text{P}_{\text{I}}$ and $\text{P}_{\text{II}}$ in the coefficients, but also transcendents $\text{P}_{\text{III}}$, $\text{P}_{\text{IV}}$, $\text{P}_{\text{V}}$ and $\text{P}_{\text{VI}}$ (and/or their derivatives). On the other side, we explore examples of rational systems with the Painlev\'e transcendents in the coefficients birationally equivalent to the Okamoto polynomial systems.
  Lastly, we present a simpler version of the change of variables to obtain the analogues of the Bureau-Guillot systems. In this framework we discuss generalisations including the mixed case: systems related to the equation $(\text{P}_{\text{J}})$, with ${\text{J}=\text{I}, \dots, \text{VI}}$, containing coefficient functions that are solutions to $(\text{P}_{\text{K}})$ with $\text{K}\neq \text{J}$. In the latter, the equation $(\text{P}_{\text{K}})$ appears as a regularising condition during the regularisation process. Although we are primarily interested in systems possessing the Painlev\'e property, we also briefly discuss an analogous construction for systems including coefficient functions solving quasi-Painlev\'e equation.</description>

      <title>The Pauli-Villars-regularized Dirac vacuum in electromagnetic fields at positive temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a model of the Dirac vacuum in classical electromagnetic fields at positive temperature. We adopt the Pauli-Villars regularisation technique in order to properly define the free energy of the vacuum, extending the previous work by the second named author on the purely magnetic case. This work is intended as a first step in understanding polarisation effects in the vacuum at positive temperature, in presence of both electrostatic and magnetic potentials.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at the Peierls-Onsager substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a general version of the Peierls-Onsager substitution for a finite family of Bloch eigenvalues under a local spectral gap hypothesis, via strongly localized tight-frames and magnetic matrices. This extends the existing results to long-range magnetic fields without any slow-variation hypothesis and without any triviality assumption for the associated Bloch sub-bundle. Moreover, our results cover a large class of periodic, elliptic pseudo-differential operators. We also prove the existence of an approximate time evolution for initial states supported inside the range of the isolated Bloch family, with a precise error control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Fifth-Order KdV Soliton in Damping Regime and Reduction to Painlev\'e Second Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a stochastic analysis of fifth-order KdV soliton momentum distribution in a damping regime. An explicit representation of the soliton momentum associated with amplitude variation is derived in terms of a random time function in the presence of dissipation. Statistical interpretations of soliton propagation modes, amplitude fluctuations, and amplification are analyzed within a $\delta$-correlated Gaussian random framework. Graphical results obtained using Python illustrate the physical insight into amplitude fluctuation and energy flow. Finally, under a dominant approximation, the nonlinear momentum evolution equation is shown to reduce to the Painlev\'e second equation, a well-known integrable model appearing in diverse physical systems.</description>

      <title>Spinors beyond Dirac, Weyl and Majorana: the Flag-Dipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall the Lounesto classification of 1/2-spin spinor fields, based on the vanishing of spinorial bilinear quantities: the classes are the regular spinor fields (i.e. the Dirac field), as well as singular spinor fields, also known as flag-dipole spinor fields, admitting two limiting sub-classes, given by the dipole spinors (i.e. the Weyl spinor) and the flagpole spinors (i.e. the Majorana spinor). We discuss each class in terms of its representatives, with particular emphasis upon the flag-dipole spinor fields.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic uncertainty principles for metaplectic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish anisotropic uncertainty principles (UPs) for general metaplectic operators acting on
  $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, including degenerate cases associated with symplectic matrices whose
  $B$-block has nontrivial kernel. In this setting, uncertainty phenomena are shown to be intrinsically
  directional and confined to an effective phase-space dimension given by $\mathrm{rank}(B)$.
  First, we prove sharp Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type inequalities involving only the directions
  corresponding to $\ker(B)^\perp$, with explicit lower bounds expressed in terms of geometric
  quantities associated with the underlying symplectic transformation. We also provide a complete
  characterization of all extremizers, which turn out to be partially Gaussian functions with free
  behavior along the null directions of $B$.
  Building on this framework, we extend the Beurling-H\"ormander theorem to the metaplectic
  setting, obtaining a precise polynomial-Gaussian structure for functions satisfying suitable
  exponential integrability conditions involving both $f$ and its metaplectic transform. Finally,
  we prove a Morgan-type (or Gel'fand--Shilov type) uncertainty principle for metaplectic operators,
  identifying a sharp threshold separating triviality from density of admissible functions and
  showing that this threshold is invariant under metaplectic transformations.
  Our results recover the classical Fourier case and free metaplectic transformations as special
  instances, and reveal the geometric and anisotropic nature of uncertainty principles in the
  presence of symplectic degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic asymptotics in discrete beta-ensembles and random tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out the asymptotic analysis of repulsive ensembles of N particles which are discrete analogues of continuous 1d log-gases or beta-ensembles of random matrix theory. The ensembles that we study have several groups of particles which can have different intensities of repulsion. They appear naturally in models of random domino and lozenge tilings, random partitions, supersymmetric gauge theory, asymptotic representation theory, discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles, etc. We allow filling fractions to be either fixed, or free, or to vary while respecting affine constraints. We are interested in the macroscopic behavior of the distribution of particles, captured by linear statistics, partition functions, and their finite-size corrections as N is large. We prove the law of large numbers and large deviations for the empirical measure around the equilibrium measure. To reach finite-size correction we assume off-criticality. For fixed filling fractions, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the partition function and for the cumulants of linear statistics, in particular establishing a central limit theorem. For varying filling fractions, we prove that the central limit theorem is perturbed by an additional discrete Gaussian component oscillating with N. We apply our general results to the study of uniformly random lozenge tilings on a large class of domains -- not necessarily planar, simply-connected, nor orientable. When the analogues of filling fractions are fixed and this domain is orientable, we show that the Gaussian fluctuations on the vertical extend to the whole liquid region and are governed there by the Gaussian free field, as predicted by the Kenyon-Okounkov conjecture. We also establish a modification of the Kenyon-Okounkov conjecture in the non-orientable case. Complementarily, we prove discrete Gaussian fluctuations for filling fractions, when they are not fixed.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor from diffeomorphism invariance in classical electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reexamine the energy-momentum tensor in classical electrodynamics from the perspective of spacetime-dependent translations, i.e., diffeomorphism invariance in flat spacetime. When energy-momentum is identified through local translations rather than constant ones, a unique, symmetric, and gauge-invariant energy-momentum tensor emerges that satisfies a genuine off shell Noether identity without invoking the equations of motion. For the free electromagnetic field, this tensor coincides with the familiar Belinfante-Rosenfeld and Bessel-Hagen expressions, but arises here directly from spacetime-dependent translation symmetry rather than from improvement procedures or compensating gauge transformations. In interacting classical electrodynamics, comprising a point charge coupled to the electromagnetic field, diffeomorphism invariance yields well-defined energy-momentum tensors for the field and the particle, while the interaction term itself generates no independent local energy-momentum tensor. Its role is instead entirely encoded in the coupled equations of motion governing energy-momentum exchange, thereby resolving ambiguities in energy-momentum localization present in canonical and improvement-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Stationary phase with Cauchy singularity. A critical point of signature $(+,-)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic expressions for an integral appearing in the solution of a d-bar problem are presented. The integral is a solid Cauchy transform of a function with a rapidly oscillating phase with a small parameter $h$, $0&lt;h\ll 1$. Whereas standard steepest descent approaches can be applied to the case where the stationary points of the phase $\omega_{k}$, $k=1,\ldots, N$ are far from the singularity $\zeta$ of the integrand, a polarization approach is proposed for the case that $|\zeta-\omega_{k}|&lt;\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{h})$ for some $k$. In this case the problem is studied in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ ($\tilde{\omega}:=\bar{\omega}$ is treated as an independent variable) on steepest descent contours. An application of Stokes' theorem allows for a decomposition of the integral into three terms for which asymptotics expressions in terms of special functions are given.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum machine learning with inverse-probability algebraic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) provide expressive probabilistic models by leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement, yet their practical training remains challenging due to highly oscillatory loss landscapes and noise inherent to near-term quantum devices. Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing. These findings suggest that inverse-probability algebraic learning offers a principled and practical alternative to procedural optimization for QNN training, particularly in resource-constrained near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Multisymplectic AKSZ sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction encodes all the data of a topological sigma-model in the finite-dimensional symplectic $Q$-manifold. Relaxing the nondegeneracy condition i.e. considering a presymplectic form instead, extends the construction to non-topological models. The gauge-invariant action functional of (presymplectic) AKSZ sigma model is written in terms of space-time differential forms and can be seen as a covariant multidimensional analogue of the usual 1st order Hamiltonian action. In this work, we show that the AKSZ construction has a natural generalisation where the target space $Q$-manifold is equipped with a form of arbitrary degree $\Omega$ (possibly inhomogeneous) which is $(\mathrm{d}+L_Q)$-closed. This data defines a higher-derivative generalisation of the AKSZ action which is still invariant under the natural gauge transformations determined by $Q$ and which is efficiently formulated in terms of a version of Chern-Weil map introduced by Kotov and Strobl. It turns out that a variety of interesting gauge theories, including higher-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, MacDowell-Mansouri-Stelle-West action and self-dual gravity as well as its higher spin extension, can be concisely reformulated as such multisymplectic AKSZ models. We also present a version of the construction in the setup of PDE geometry and demonstrate that the counterpart of the multisymplectic AKSZ action is precisely the standard multisymplectic formulation, where the Chern-Weil map corresponds to the usual pullback map.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dipolar Electrostatic Modeling of Plasmonic Nanoparticles with Arbitrary Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and fast calculations of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in metallic nanoparticles is essential for applications in sensing, nano-optics, and energy harvesting. Although full-wave numerical techniques such as the boundary element method (BEM) or the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) provide high accuracy, their computational cost often hinders rapid parametric studies. Here it is presented an ultrafast method that avoids solving large eigenproblems. Instead, only the dipolar component of the induced surface charge density \((\sigma_{dipolar})\) is retained through a expansion into Cartesion dipole basis, yielding a compact $3\times3$ geometric formulation that avoids full boundary-integral solves. The spectral response is obtained in a similar way, by projecting the Neumann--Poincar\'e surface operator onto the dipole subspace and evaluating a Rayleigh quotient, giving geometry-only eigenvalues again without an $N\times N$ eigenproblem. A major advantage of this method is that all geometry-dependent quantities are computed once per nanoparticle, while material dispersion and environmental changes enter only through simple algebraic expressions for the polarizability, enabling rapid evaluation across wavelengths. Retardation effects are incorporated through the modified long-wavelength approximation (MLWA), extending accuracy into the weakly retarded regime. The resulting framework provides a valuable tool for fast modelling and optimization of plasmonic nanoparticles at a significant lesser computational cost than BEM, DDA, and other standard tools.</description>

      <title>Duality, asymptotic charges and higher form symmetries in $p$-form gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface charges associated with $p$-form gauge fields in the Bondi patch of $D$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime are computed. We show that, under the Hodge duality between the field strengths of the dual formulations, electric-like charges for $p$-forms are mapped to magnetic-like charges for the dual $q$-forms, with $q=D-p-2$. We observe that the complex combination of electric-like and magnetic-like charges transforms under duality according to a specific M\"obius transformation. This leads to a possible construction of CCFT in $D=4$ as a M\"obius-principal equivariant bundle, together with its associated bundles, in order to recover celestial operators. We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for the duality map relating the asymptotic electric-like charges of the dual descriptions, and we provide an algebraic-topological interpretation of this map. As a result, the duality map has a topological nature and ensures that the charge of one formulation contains information about the dual formulation, leading to a deeper understanding of gauge theories, the non-trivial charges associated with them, and the duality of their observables. Moreover, we propose a link between higher-form symmetry charges, naturally associated with a $p$-form gauge theory, and their asymptotic charges. The higher-form charges are reproduced by choosing the gauge parameter to be constant and supported only on an appropriate codimension submanifold. This could partially answer an open question in the celestial holography program.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>

Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics on the probability simplex, leading to probability manifolds or finite-state Wasserstein--2 spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian operators of energies, parallel transport, and calculating both the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. One example is the Levi-Civita connection from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction. The other example is the sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice graph.</description>

      <title>Modified rational six vertex model on a rectangular lattice : new formula, homogeneous and thermodynamic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use numerics to construct solitary waves $\phi_\omega(x) e^{-\mathrm{i}\omega t}$ in Dirac--Klein--Gordon (in one and three spatial dimensions) and study the dependence of energy and charge of $\omega$. To construct solitary waves, we use two different procedures: the iterative method and the nested shooting method. We also consider the case of massless scalar field where we show that the standard shooting method becomes available. We use the virial identities to control the error of simulations. We discuss possible implications for the stability of solitary waves.</description>

      <title>Integral Transforms for Finite Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that quantization of $\pi$-finite spaces, as a functor out of a higher category of spans, is equivariant in two ways: Symmetries of a given polarization/Lagrangian always induce coherent symmetries of the quantization. On the other hand, symmetries of the entire phase space a priori only induce projective symmetries, with an invertible once-categorified theory, the anomaly theory, encoding the projectivity.
  We give projective symmetries of three-dimensional finite gauge theories a concrete description via a twice-categorified analogue of Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernels and the associated integral transforms, such as the Fourier transform. This establishes an analogy between certain instances of the $\pi$-finite quantization procedure considered herein and the geometric quantization of a symplectic vector space.</description>

      <title>Localized stem structures in quasi-resonant solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the phase shift of X-shaped solutions before and after interaction is finite but approaches infinity, the vertices of the two V-shaped structures become separated due to the phase shift and are connected by a localized structure, which is referred to as the stem structure. This special type of elastic collision is known as a quasi-resonant collision. This study investigates quasi-resonant solutions and the associated localized stem structures in the context of the KPII and KPI equations. For the KPII equation, we classify quasi-resonant 2-solitons into weakly and strongly types, depending on whether the phase approaches \(-\infty\) or \(+\infty\). We analyze their asymptotic forms to detail the trajectories, amplitudes, velocities, and lengths of their stem structures. These results of quasi-resonant 2-solitons are used to to provide analytical descriptions of interesting patterns of the water waves observed on shallow water surface. Similarly, for the KPI equation, we construct quasi-resonant breather-soliton solutions and classify them into weakly and strongly types, based on the behavior of their internal parameters. We compare the similarities and differences between the stem structures in the quasi-resonant soliton and the quasi-resonant breather-soliton. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their asymptotic forms and stem structures. Our results indicate that the resonant solution, i.e. resonant breather-soliton of the KPI and soliton for the KPII, represents the limiting case of the quasi-resonant solution as phase approaches \(\infty\).</description>

      <title>Existence theorem on the UV limit of Wilsonian RG flows of Feynman measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of Euclidean signature quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman measures. Such an RG flow is a family of Feynman measures on the space of ultraviolet (UV) regularized fields, linked by the Wilsonian renormalization group equation. In this paper we show that under mild conditions, a Wilsonian RG flow of Feynman measures extending to arbitrary regularization strengths has a factorization property: there exists an ultimate Feynman measure (UV limit) on the distribution sense fields, such that the regularized instances in the flow are obtained from this UV limit via taking the marginal measure against the regulator. Existence theorems on the flow and UV limit of the corresponding action functional are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a selfadjoint magnetic Schr\"odinger operator \begin{equation*} H = ( i \partial + A(x) )^2 + V(x) \end{equation*} on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $V(x)$ strictly subquadratic and $A(x)$ strictly sublinear, we prove that the flow $u(t)=e^{-itH}u(0)$ satisfies an Amrein--Berthier type inequality \begin{equation*} \|u(t)\|_{L^{2}}\lesssim_{E,F,T,A,V} \|u(0)\|_{L^{2}(E^{c})} + \|u(T)\|_{L^{2}(F^{c})}, \qquad 0\le t\le T \end{equation*} for all compact sets $E,F \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. In particular, if both $u(0)$ and $u(T)$ are compactly supported, then $u$ vanishes identically. Under different assumptions on the operator, which allow for time--dependent coefficients, the result extends to sets $E,F$ of finite measure. We also consider a few variants for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with singular coefficients, metaplectic operators, and we include applications to control theory.</description>

Abstract: The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J. Geom. Phys}} {\bf{215}} (2025) 105540). These are a generalization of Euler's elasticae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second eigenfunction of the Neumann Laplacian on convex, planar domains is considered. Inspired by the famous hot spots conjecture and a related result of Steinerberger, we show that potential critical points of this eigenfunction (and, in particular, interior ''hot spots'') cannot be located ''near the center'' of the domain. The region in which critical points are excluded is described explicitly.</description>

      <title>Complexity of mixed Schatten norms of quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of computing the mixed Schatten $\|\Phi\|_{q\to p}$ norms of linear maps $\Phi$ between matrix spaces. When $\Phi$ is completely positive, we show that $\| \Phi \|_{q \to p}$ can be computed efficiently when $q \geq p$. The regime $q \geq p$ is known as the non-hypercontractive regime and is also known to be easy for the mixed vector norms $\ell_{q} \to \ell_{p}$ [Boyd, 1974]. However, even for entanglement-breaking completely-positive trace-preserving maps $\Phi$, we show that computing $\| \Phi \|_{1 \to p}$ is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when $p&gt;1$. Moving beyond the completely-positive case and considering $\Phi$ to be difference of entanglement breaking completely-positive trace-preserving maps, we prove that computing $\| \Phi \|^+_{1 \to 1}$ is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. In contrast, for the completely-bounded (cb) case, we describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute $\|\Phi\|_{cb,1\to p}$ and $\|\Phi\|^+_{cb,1\to p}$ for any linear map $\Phi$ and $p\geq1$.</description>

      <title>The sphere free energy of the vector models to order $1/N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to order $1/N$. Analytic regularization of these theories requires consistently shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its $\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the vector's scaling dimension.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of the two-Higgs-doublet model field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply Lie symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), to determine its scalar Lie point symmetries. A Lie point symmetry is a structure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields of the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity. Symmetries of PDEs may, in general, be divided into strict variational, divergence and non-variational symmetries, where the first two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational symmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie symmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie point divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the 2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries, thus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method. Moreover, we prove three general results that may simplify Lie symmetry calculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis of PDEs is broadly applicable for determining Lie symmetries. As demonstrated in this work, the method can be applied to models with many variables, parameters, and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries can be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry algebras.</description>

      <title>On taming Moffatt-Kimura vortices of doom in the viscous case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we propose a two-layer viscous mechanism for preventing finite time singularity formation in the Moffatt-Kimura model of two counter-rotating vortex rings colliding at a nontrivial angle. In the first layer the scenario is recast within the framework of the study of turbulent dissipation based on a suitably defined `scale of sparseness' of the regions of intense fluid activity. Here it is found that the problem is (at worst) critical, i.e., the upper bound on the scale of sparseness of the vorticity super-level sets is comparable to the lower bound on the radius of spatial analyticity. In the second layer, an additional more subtle mechanism is identified, potentially capable of driving the scale of sparseness into the dissipation range and preventing the formation of a singularity. The mechanism originates in certain analytic cancellation properties of the vortex-stretching term in the sense of compensated compactness in Hardy spaces which then convert information on local mean oscillations of the vorticity direction (boundedness in certain log-composite weighted local bmo spaces) into log-composite faster decay of the vorticity super-level sets.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Quantum Codes Beyond the Pauli Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical stabilizer codes aim to solve the general problem of fault-tolerance without regard for the structure of a specific system. By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to ensembles of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics governed by maximum-entropy principles, known as deep thermalization. At infinite temperature this universality is characterized by Haar-random ensembles. More generally, physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws lead to Scrooge ensembles, which are maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with these constraints. Here we introduce Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and use this framework to sharpen the conditions under which Scrooge-like behavior emerges. We first show that global Scrooge designs arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without measurements. Second, we show that measuring a complementary subsystem of a scrambled global state drawn from a global Scrooge $2k$-design induces a local Scrooge $k$-design. Third, we show that a local Scrooge $k$-design arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a scrambled basis induced by a unitary drawn from a Haar $2k$-design. These results show that the resources required to generate approximate Scrooge ensembles scale only with the desired degree of approximation, enabling efficient implementations. Complementing our analytical results, numerical simulations identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential ingredients for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Together, our findings advance theoretical explanations for maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion</title>

Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $\phi$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B &gt; -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</description>
