      <title>Modelling absorption and emission profiles from accretion disc winds with WINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, massive winds are ubiquitously observed in the UV and X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and other accreting sources. Theoretical and observational evidences suggest they are launched at accretion disc scales, carrying significant mass and angular momentum. Thanks to such high energy output, they may play an important role in transferring the accretion energy to the surrounding environment. In the case of AGNs, this process can help setting the so-called coevolution between the AGN and its host galaxy. To precisely assess the effective role of these winds, it is necessary to accurately measure their properties, including mass and energy rates. We aim to maximise the scientific return of current and future observations by improving the theoretical modelling of these winds through our Winds in the Ionised Nuclear Environment (WINE) model. WINE is a spectroscopic model designed for disc winds in AGNs and compact accreting sources, which couples photoionisation and radiative transfer with special relativistic effects and a three-dimensional model of the emission profiles. We explore with WINE the main spectral features associated to AGN disc winds, with particular emphasis on the detectability of the wind emission. We simulate observations with the X-ray microcalorimeters Resolve on board the XRISM satellite and the future Athena's X-IFU for the typical properties and exposure times of the sources in the XRISM Performance Verification phase. The wind kinematic, geometry, ionisation and column density deeply affect shape and strength of the spectral features. Thanks to this, both Resolve and X-IFU will be able to accurately constrain the main properties of disc winds in a broad range of parameters. We also find a dramatic difference in the gas opacity when using a soft, Narrow Line Seyfert 1-like SED compared to a canonical powerlaw SED with spectral index Gamma=2.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Estimation using Machine Learning and the Associated Web-App</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed at redshifts as high as 9.4, could serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases. Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods. Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles</description>

      <title>PKS 2254+074: A Blazar in Likely Association with the Neutrino Event IceCube-190619A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our study of the field of a $\simeq$0.2 PeV neutrino event IC-190619A. This neutrino belongs to Gold events, which more likely have an astrophysical origin. Among the two $\gamma$-ray sources within the neutrino's positional uncertainty region, we find that one of them, the BL-Lac--type blazar PKS~2254+074, had a $\gamma$-ray flare at the arrival time of the neutrino. The flare is determined to have lasted $\sim$2.5 yr in a 180-day binned light curve, constructed from the data collected with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. Accompanying the flare, optical and mid-infrared brightening is also seen. In addition, $\geq$10 GeV high energy photons from the source have been detected, suggesting a hardening of the emission during the flare. Given both the positional and temporal coincidence of PKS~2254+074 with IC-190619A, we suggest that this blazar is likely another member of a few recently identified (candidate) neutrino-emitting blazars.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Insight-HXMT Gamma-Ray Burst Data. I. Power Density Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power Density Spectrum (PDS) is one of the powerful tools to study light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We show the average PDS and individual PDS analysis with {\it Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope} (also named \insighthxmt) GRBs data. The values of power-law index of average PDS ($\alpha_{\bar{P}}$) for long GRBs (LGRBs) vary from 1.58-1.29 (for 100-245, 245-600, and 600-2000 keV). The \insighthxmt\ data allow us to extend the energy of the LGRBs up to 2000 keV, and a relation between $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$ and energy $E$, $\alpha_{\bar{P}}\propto E^{-0.09}$ (8-2000 keV) is obtained. We first systematically investigate the average PDS and individual PDS for short GRBs (SGRBs), and obtain $\alpha_{\bar{P}}\propto E^{-0.07}$ (8-1000 keV), where the values of $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$ vary from 1.86 to 1.34. The distribution of power-law index of individual PDS ($\alpha$) of SGRB, is consistent with that of LGRB, and the $\alpha$ value for the dominant timescale group (the bent power-law, BPL) is higher than that for the no-dominant timescale group (the single power-law, PL). Both LGRBs and SGRBs show similar $\alpha$ and $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$, which indicates that they may be the result of similar stochastic processes. The typical value of dominant timescale $\tau$ for LGRBs and SGRBs is 1.58 s and 0.02 s, respectively. It seems that the $\tau$ in proportion to the duration of GRBs $T_{90}$, with a relation $\tau \propto T_{90}^{0.86}$. The GRB light curve may result from superposing a number of pulses with different timescales. No periodic and quasi-periodical signal above the 3$\sigma$ significance threshold is found in our sample.</description>

      <title>The GROND gamma-ray burst sample. I. Overview and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dedicated gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observing program was performed between 2007 and 2016 with GROND, a seven-channel optical and near-infrared imager at the 2.2m telescope of the Max-Planck Society at ESO/La Silla. In this first of a series of papers, we describe the GRB observing plan, providing first readings of all so far unpublished GRB afterglow measurements and some observing statistics. In total, we observed 514 GRBs with GROND, including 434 Swift-detected GRBs, representing 81\% of the observable Swift sample. For GROND-observations within 30 min of the GRB trigger, the optical/NIR afterglow detection rate is 81\% for long- and 57\% for short-duration GRBs. We report the discovery of ten new GRB afterglows plus one candidate, along with redshift estimates (partly improved) for four GRBs and new host detections for seven GRBs. We identify the (already known) afterglow of GRB 140209A as the sixth GRB exhibiting a 2175 Angstroem dust feature. As a side result, we identified two blazars, with one at a redshift of z=3.8 (in the GRB 131209A field).</description>

      <title>Reversals of toroidal magnetic field in local shearing box simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presence of a hot corona above the accretion disc can have important consequences for the evolution of magnetic fields and the Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in such a strongly coupled system. In this work, we have performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical shearing-box numerical simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona above the cool disc. Such a two-layer, piece-wise isothermal system is vertically stratified under linear gravity and initial conditions here include a strong azimuthal magnetic field with a ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressures being of order unity in the disc region. Instabilities in this magnetized system lead to the generation of turbulence, which, in turn, governs the further evolution of magnetic fields in a self-sustaining manner. Remarkably, the mean toroidal magnetic field undergoes a complete reversal in time by changing its sign, and it is predominantly confined within the disc. This is a rather unique class of evolution of the magnetic field which has not been reported earlier. Solutions of mean magnetic fields here are thus qualitatively different from the vertically migrating dynamo waves that are commonly seen in previous works which model a single layer of an isothermal gas. Effective $\alpha$ is found to have values between 0.01 and 0.03. We have also made a comparison between models with Smagorinsky and explicit schemes for the kinematic viscosity ($\nu$). In some cases with an explicit $\nu$ we find a burst-like temporal behavior in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Nova Z Chamaeleontis in Quiescence and Outburst Using the XMM-Newton Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray spectroscopy of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova (DN) Z Cha using the EPIC and RGS instruments onboard the XMM-Newton Observatory. The quiescent system can be modeled by collisional equilibrium or nonequilibrium plasma models, yielding a kT of 8.2-13.0 keV at a luminosity of (5.0-6.0)$\times$10$^{30}$ erg/s. The spectra yield better reduced $\chi^{2}$ using partial covering absorbers of cold and photoionized nature. The ionized absorber has an equivalent N$_H$=(3.4-5.9)$\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a log($\xi$)=3.5-3.7 with (50-60)% covering fraction when VNEI model (XSPEC) is used. The line diagnosis in quiescence shows no resonance lines with only detected forbidden lines of Ne, Mg, Si. The H-like C, O, Ne, and Mg are detected. The strongest line is O VIII with (2.7-4.6)$\times$10$^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. The quiescent X-ray emitting plasma is not collisional and not in ionization equilibrium which is consistent with hot ADAF-like accretion flows. The line diagnosis in outburst shows He-like O, and Ne with intercombination lines being the strongest along with weaker resonance lines. This indicates the plasma is more collisional and denser, but yet not in a collisional equilibrium, revealing ionization timescales of (0.97-1.4)$\times$10$^{11}$ s cm$^{-3}$. The R-ratios in outburst yield electron densities of (7-90)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the G-ratios yield electron temperatures of (2-3)$\times$10$^{6}$ K. The outburst luminosity is (1.4-2.5)$\times$10$^{30}$ erg/s. The flow is inhomogeneous in density. All detected lines are narrow with widths limited by the resolution of RGS yielding Keplerian rotational velocities $&lt;$1000 km/s. This is too low for boundary layers, consistent with the nature of ADAF-like hot flows.</description>

      <title>Constrains on dark matter cross section with standard model particles from the orbital period decay of binary pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the data from the orbital period decay of binary pulsars give strong constraints on the dark matter-nucleons cross section. The limits are robust and competitive because this new method for testing dark matter interactions with standard model particles has a minimal number of assumptions combined with the extremely high accuracy on the measurement of the decay rate of the orbital period of binary systems. Our results exclude (with 95% confidence) spin independent interactions with cross sections greater that 3.1x10-31 cm2 for a dark matter particle with mass mc2 = 1 keV and 3.7x10-31 cm2 for mc2= 1 TeV which improves by several orders of magnitude previous constraints.</description>

      <title>Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass-radius measurements II: Hyperonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether measurements of the neutron star mass and radius or the tidal deformability can provide information about the presence of hyperons inside a neutron star. This is achieved by considering two inference models, with and without hyperons, based on a field-theoretical approach. While current observations do not distinguish between the two scenarios, we have shown that data simulating expected observations from future large area X-ray timing telescopes could provide some information through Bayes factors. Inference using simulated data generated from an EOS containing hyperons decisively favours the hyperonic model over the nucleonic model. However, a 2\% uncertainty in the mass and radius determination may not be sufficient to constrain the parameters of the model when only six neutron star mass-radius measurements are considered.</description>

      <title>The interplay of astrophysics and nuclear physics in determining the properties of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star properties depend on both nuclear physics and astrophysical processes, and thus observations of neutron stars offer constraints on both large-scale astrophysics and the behavior of cold, dense matter. In this study, we use astronomical data to jointly infer the universal equation of state of dense matter along with two distinct astrophysical populations: Galactic neutron stars observed electromagnetically and merging neutron stars in binaries observed with gravitational waves. We place constraints on neutron star properties and quantify the extent to which they are attributable to macrophysics or microphysics. We confirm previous results indicating that the Galactic and merging neutron stars have distinct mass distributions. The inferred maximum mass of both Galactic neutron stars, $M_{\rm pop, EM}=2.05^{+0.11}_{-0.06}\,M_{\odot}$ (median and 90\% symmetric credible interval), and merging neutron star binaries, $M_{\rm pop, GW}=1.85^{+0.39}_{-0.16}\,M_{\odot}$, are consistent with the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars set by nuclear physics, $M_{\rm TOV} =2.28^{+0.41}_{-0.21}\,M_\odot$. The radius of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star is $12.2^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\,$km, consistent with, though $\sim 20\%$ tighter than, previous results using an identical equation of state model. Even though observed Galactic and merging neutron stars originate from populations with distinct properties, there is currently no evidence that astrophysical processes cannot produce neutron stars up to the maximum value imposed by nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>A diverse, overlooked population of Type Ia supernovae exhibiting mid-infrared signatures of delayed circumstellar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae arise from the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in multiple star systems. A rare sub-class of SNe Ia exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), allowing for direct constraints on companion material. While most known events show evidence for dense nearby CSM identified via peak-light spectroscopy (as SNe Ia-CSM), targeted late-time searches have revealed a handful of cases exhibiting delayed CSM interaction with detached shells. Here, we present the first all-sky search for late CSM interaction in SNe Ia using a new image-subtraction pipeline for mid-infrared data from the NEOWISE space telescope. Analyzing a sample of $\approx 8500$ SNe Ia, we report evidence for late-time mid-infrared brightening in six previously overlooked events spanning sub-types SNe Iax, normal SNe Ia, SNe Ia-91T and super-Chandra SNe Ia. Our systematic search doubles the known sample, and suggests that $\gtrsim 0.1$% of SNe Ia exhibit mid-infrared signatures of delayed CSM interaction. The mid-infrared light curves ubiquitously indicate the presence of multiple (or extended) detached CSM shells located at $\gtrsim 10^{16}-10^{17}$ cm, containing $10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ $M_\odot$ of dust, with some sources showing evidence for new dust formation, likely within the cold, dense shell of the ejecta. We do not detect interaction signatures in spectroscopic and radio follow-up; however, the limits are largely consistent with previously confirmed events given the sensitivity and observation phase. Our results highlight that CSM interaction is more prevalent than previously estimated from optical and ultraviolet searches, and that mid-infrared synoptic surveys provide a unique window into this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On the use of galaxy catalogs in gravitational-wave parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in gravitational-wave multi-messenger astrophysics is the imprecise localization of gravitational-wave compact binary mergers. We investigate the use of a method to include galaxy catalog information in performing parameter estimation of these events. We test its effectiveness with the gravitational-wave events GW170817, GW190425, and GW190814, as well as with simulated binary neutron star mergers. For GW170817, we recover the true host galaxy as the most probable galaxy after a straightforward mass reweighting, with significantly decreased localization area and volume. On the simulated sample, however, we do not find improvement compared to performing a simple galaxy catalog crossmatch with a regular gravitational wave localization. Future investigations into sampling methods may yield improvements that increase the viability of this method.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Interactions in White Dwarfs: A Multi-Energy Approach to Capture Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a compelling avenue for probing interactions of dark matter particles, particularly in the challenging sub-GeV mass regime. The constraints derived from these celestial objects strongly depend on the existence of high dark matter densities in the corresponding regions of the Universe, where white dwarfs are observed. This implies that excluding the parameter space using local white dwarfs would present a significant challenge, primarily due to the low dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood. This limitation prompts the exploration of alternative scenarios involving dark matter particles with a diverse spectrum of kinetic energies. In this work, we investigate how these dark matter particles traverse the star, interact with stellar matter, and ultimately get captured. To accomplish this, we approximate the dark matter flux as a delta function and inspired on the Three Portal Model, we assume that fermionic dark matter interacts with stellar matter either through a broken $U(1)$ gauge vector mediator or a scalar. In our computations, we consider how interactions might vary across different energy regimes, from high-energy deep inelastic scattering and inelastic scatterings via the production of $N-$ and $\Delta-$ resonances to lower-energy elastic interactions with nucleons and nuclei. Our study models these inelastic resonant interactions with dark matter and vector or scalar mediators for the very first time. We provide insights into the specific conditions required for successfully boosted dark matter capture in white dwarfs. We found that, in general, dark matter capture is most likely to occur at low energies, as expected. However, in the high-energy regime, there remains a small window for capture through resonant and deep inelastic scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Black-Hole Cartography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes (QNMs) are usually characterized by their time dependence; oscillations at specific frequencies predicted by black hole (BH) perturbation theory. QNMs are routinely identified in the ringdown of numerical relativity waveforms, are widely used in waveform modeling, and underpin key tests of general relativity and of the nature of compact objects; a program sometimes called BH spectroscopy. Perturbation theory also predicts a specific spatial shape for each QNM perturbation. For the Kerr metric, these are the ($s=-2$) spheroidal harmonics. Spatial information can be extracted from numerical relativity by fitting a feature with known time dependence to all of the spherical harmonic modes, allowing the shape of the feature to be reconstructed; a program initiated here and that we call BH cartography. Accurate spatial reconstruction requires fitting to many spherical harmonics and is demonstrated using highly accurate Cauchy-characteristic numerical relativity waveforms. The loudest QNMs are mapped, and their reconstructed shapes are found to match the spheroidal harmonic predictions. The cartographic procedure is also applied to the quadratic QNMs - nonlinear features in the ringdown - and their reconstructed shapes are compared with predictions from second-order perturbation theory. BH cartography allows us to determine the viewing angles that maximize the amplitude of the quadratic QNMs, an important guide for future searches, and is expected to lead to an improved understanding of nonlinearities in BH ringdown.</description>

      <title>Structure, maximum mass, and stability of compact stars in f(Q,T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physically based changes to general relativity (GR) often predict significant differences in how spacetime behaves near massive neutron stars. One of these modifications is represented by $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})$, with $\mathcal{Q}$ being the non-metricity and ${ \mathit{T}}$ representing the energy-momentum tensor trace. This theory is viewed as a neutral expansion of GR. Neutron stars weighing more than 1.8 times the mass of the Sun, when observed as radio pulsars, provide valuable opportunities to test fundamental physics under extreme conditions that are rare in the observable universe and cannot be replicated in experiments conducted on land. We derive an exact solution through utilizing the form $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})=\mathcal{Q}+\psi { \mathcal{T}}$, where $\psi$ represents a dimensional expression. We elucidate that all physical quantities within the star can be expressed using the dimensional parameter $\psi$ and the compactness, which is defined as $C=\frac{ 2GM}{Rc^2}$. We set $\psi$ to a maximum value of $\psi_1=\frac{\psi}{\kappa^2}=-0.04$ in the negative range, based on observational constraints related to radius and mass of the pulsar ${\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}$. Here, ${\mathrm \kappa^2}$ represents the coupling constant of Einstein, defined as ${\mathrm \kappa^2=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}}$. Unlike in GR, the solution we derived results in a stable compact object without violating the conjectured sound speed condition $c_s^2\leq\frac{c^2}3$.It is crucial to mention that no equations of state were assumed in this investigation. Nevertheless, our model fits nicely with linear form. Generally, when $\psi$ is negative, the theory predicts a star with a slightly larger size than GR for the same mass. The difference in predicted size between the theory with a negative $\psi$ and GR for the same mass is attributed to an additional force.</description>

      <title>The red supergiant progenitor luminosity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of pre-explosion imaging has confirmed red supergiants (RSGs) as the progenitors to Type II-P supernovae (SNe). However, extracting the RSG's luminosity requires assumptions regarding the star's temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction, circumstellar extinction, and possible variability. The robustness of these assumptions is difficult to test, since we cannot go back in time and obtain additional pre-explosion imaging. Here, we perform a simple test using the RSGs in M31, which have been well observed from optical to mid-IR. We ask the following: By treating each star as if we only had single-band photometry and making assumptions typically used in SN progenitor studies, what bolometric luminosity would we infer for each star? How close is this to the bolometric luminosity for that same star inferred from the full optical-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED)? We find common assumptions adopted in progenitor studies systematically underestimate the bolometric luminosity by a factor of 2, typically leading to inferred progenitor masses that are systematically too low. Additionally, we find a much larger spread in luminosity derived from single-filter photometry compared to SED-derived luminosities, indicating uncertainties in progenitor luminosities are also underestimated. When these corrections and larger uncertainties are included in the analysis, even the most luminous known RSGs are not ruled out at the 3$\sigma$ level, indicating there is currently no statistically significant evidence that the most luminous RSGs are missing from the observed sample of II-P progenitors. The proposed correction also alleviates the problem of having progenitors with masses below the expected lower-mass bound for core-collapse.</description>

      <title>On Finding Black Holes in Photometric Microlensing Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are expected to be millions of isolated black holes in the Galaxy resulting from the death of massive stars. Measuring the abundance and properties of this remnant population would shed light on the end stages of stellar evolution and the evolution paths of black hole systems. Detecting isolated black holes is currently only possible via gravitational microlensing which has so far yielded one definitive detection. The difficulty in finding microlensing black holes lies in having to choose a small subset of events based on characteristics of their lightcurves to allocate expensive and scarce follow-up resources to confirm the identity of the lens. Current methods either rely on simple cuts in parameter space without using the full distribution information or are only effective on a small subsets of events. In this paper we present a new lens classification method. The classifier takes in posterior constraints on lightcurve parameters and combines them with a Galactic simulation to estimate the lens class probability. This method is flexible and can be used with any set of microlensing lightcurve parameters making it applicable to large samples of events. We make this classification framework available via the popclass python package. We apply the classifier to $\sim10,000$ microlensing events from the OGLE survey and find $23$ high-probability black hole candidates. Our classifier also suggests that the only known isolated black hole is an observational outlier according to current Galactic models and allocation of astrometric follow-up on this event was a high-risk strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Euclidean methods we investigate the thermodynamics of stealth black hole solutions, which are solutions that geometrically are indistinguishable from those of general relativity, however they are accompanied by a non-trivial additional field that does not back-react to the metric. We find that in general, one can observe shifts in the mass and/or the entropy of such black holes, hence, at least at the thermodynamic level, the stealth solutions may be distinguished by the those of general relativity. We also point out an example, the {\it{bona fide stealth}}, where a non-trivial scalar field can accompany an (A)dS-Schwarzschild black hole without altering the thermodynamic quantities. We point out that thermodynamic discrepancies arise due to the additional boundary terms emanating from the stealth fields, where care should be given in order for the theory at hand to possess a well-defined variational procedure.</description>

Abstract: The O-type long-period binary HD 168112 and triple HD 167971 star systems have been known for several decades for their non-thermal synchrotron radio emission. This emission arises from relativistic electrons accelerated in the hydrodynamic shocks of the wind collisions in these systems. Such wind collisions are expected to produce a strong X-ray emission that varies as a function of orbital phase. In wide eccentric binaries, such as our targets, the X-ray emission arises from an adiabatic plasma and its intensity should scale as the inverse of the orbital separation. We present a set of XMM-Newton observations of these systems which help us gain insight into the properties of their wind interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EDR and eRASS1 data have already revealed a remarkable number of undiscovered X-ray sources. Using Bayesian inference and generative modeling techniques for X-ray imaging, we aim to increase the sensitivity and scientific value of these observations by denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing the X-ray sky. Leveraging information field theory, we can exploit the spatial and spectral correlation structures of the different physical components of the sky with non-parametric priors to enhance the image reconstruction. By incorporating instrumental effects into the forward model, we develop a comprehensive Bayesian imaging algorithm for eROSITA pointing observations. Finally, we apply the developed algorithm to EDR data of the LMC SN1987A, fusing data sets from observations made by five different telescope modules. The final result is a denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed view of the LMC, which enables the analysis of its fine-scale structures, the creation of point source catalogues of this region, and enhanced calibration for future work.</description>

      <title>Effects of waveform systematics on inferences of neutron star population properties and the nuclear equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiralling neutron stars carry information about matter at extreme gravity and density. The binary neutron star (BNS) event GW170817 provided, for the first time, insight into dense matter through this window. Since then, another BNS (GW190425) and several neutron star-black hole events have been detected, although the tidal measurements were not expected to be well-constrained from them. Collective information regarding the behavior of nuclear matter at extreme densities can be done by performing a joint population inference for the masses, spins, and equation-of-state [1] to enable better understanding. This population inference, in turn, relies on accurate estimates of intrinsic parameters of individual events. In this study, we investigate how the differences in parameter inference of BNS events using different waveform models can affect the eventual inference of the nuclear equation-of-state. We use the state-of-the-art model TEOBResumS with IMRPhenomD NRTidalv2 as a comparison model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectra of several galaxies, including extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) from the EMPRESS survey, have shown that the abundances of some Si-group elements differ from "spherical" explosion models of massive stars. This leads to the speculation that these galaxies have experienced supernova explosions with high asphericity, where mixing and fallback of the inner ejecta with the outer material leads to the distinctive chemical compositions. In this article, we consider the jet-driven supernova models by direct two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations using progenitors about 20 -- 25 $M_{\odot}$ at zero metallicity. We investigate how the abundance patterns depend on the progenitor mass, mass cut and the asphericity of the explosion. We compare the observable with available supernova and galaxy catalogs based on $^{56}$Ni, ejecta mass, and individual element ratios. The proximity of our results with the observational data signifies the importance of aspherical supernova explosions in chemical evolution of these galaxies. Our models will provide the theoretical counterpart for understanding the chemical abundances of high-z galaxies measured by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulse profile modelling (PPM) is a comprehensive relativistic ray-tracing technique employed to determine the properties of neutron stars. In this study, we apply this technique to the Type I X-ray burster and accretion-powered millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338, extracting its fundamental properties using PPM of its thermonuclear burst oscillations. Using data from its 2003 outburst, and a single uniform temperature hot spot model, we infer XTE J1814-338 to be located at a distance of $7.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ kpc, with a mass of $1.21^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ M$_\odot$ and an equatorial radius of $7.0^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km. Our results also offer insight into the time evolution of the hot spot but point to some potential shortcomings of the single uniform temperature hot spot model. We explore the implications of this result, including what we can learn about thermonuclear burst oscillation mechanisms and the importance of modelling the accretion contribution to the emission during the burst.</description>

      <title>Collisionless shock in a relativistically hot unmagnetized electron-positron plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate collisionless shocks propagating in a relativistically hot unmagnetized electron-positron plasmas. We estimate the dissipation fraction at shocks in the relativistically hot plasma, showing that it is sufficiently large to explain the observation of gamma-ray bursts even when the shock is not highly relativistic. It is shown by two-dimensional particle in cell simulations that magnetic fields are generated around the shock front by the Weibel instability, as in the cold upstream plasma. However, in contrast to the cold upstream plasma, no particles are accelerated at the shock in the simulation time of $t = 3600 \omega_p^{-1}$. The decay of the magnetic field in the downstream region is slower for slower shock velocities in the hot plasma cases. Applying the slow decay of the downstream magnetic field, we propose a model that generate magnetic fields in large downstream region, which is required from the standard model of the gamma-ray burst afterglow.</description>

      <title>A Trifecta of Modelling Tools: A Bayesian Binary Black Hole Model Selection combining Population Synthesis and Galaxy Formation Models</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have revealed surprising properties of binary black hole (BBH) populations, but there is still mystery surrounding how these compact objects evolve. We apply Bayesian inference and an efficient method to calculate the BBH merger rates in the Shark host galaxies, to determine the combination of COMPAS parameters that outputs a population most like the GW sources from the LVK transient catalogue. For our COMPAS models, we calculate the likelihood with and without the dependence on the predicted number of BBH merger events. We find strong correlations between hyper-parameters governing the specific angular momentum (AM) of mass lost during mass transfer, the mass-loss rates of Wolf-Rayet stars via winds and the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) formation channel. We conclude that analysing the marginalised and unmarginalised likelihood is a good indicator of whether the population parameters distribution and number of observed events reflect the LVK data. In doing so, we see that the majority of the models preferred in terms of the population-level parameters of the BBHs greatly overpredict the number of events we should have observed to date. Looking at the smaller number of models which perform well with both likelihoods, we find that those with no CHE, AM loss occurring closer to the donor during the first mass-transfer event, and/or higher rates of mass-loss from Wolf-Rayet winds are generally preferred by current data. We find these conclusions to be robust to our choice of selection criteria.</description>

      <title>A second view on the X-ray polarization of NGC 4151 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the second observing program of the active galactic nucleus NGC 4151 with simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE; {\sim}750 ks), NuSTAR ({\sim}60 ks), XMM-Newton ({\sim}75 ks), and NICER ({\sim}65 ks) pointings. NGC 4151 is the first Type 1 radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy with constrained polarization properties for the X-ray corona. Despite the lower flux state in which the source is re-observed and the resulting higher contribution of the constant reflection component in the IXPE energy band, our results are in agreement with the first detection. From polarimetric analysis, a polarization degree {\Pi} = 4.7 {\pm} 1.3 percent and angle {\Psi} = 77{\deg} {\pm} 8{\deg} east of north (68 percent confidence level) are derived in the 2.0 - 8.0 keV energy range. Combining the two observations leads to polarization properties that are more constrained than those of the individual detections, showing {\Pi} = 4.5 {\pm} 0.9 percent and {\Psi} = 81{\deg} {\pm} 6{\deg} (with detection significance {\sim}4.6{\sigma}). The observed polarization angle aligns very well with the radio emission in this source, supporting, together with the significant polarization degree, a slab or wedge geometry for the X-ray corona. However, a switch in the polarization angle at low energies (37{\deg} {\pm} 7{\deg} in the 2 - 3.5 keV bin) suggests the presence of another component. When it is included in the spectro-polarimetric fit, a high polarization degree disfavors an interpretation in terms of a leakage through the absorbers, rather pointing to scattering from some kind of mirror.</description>

      <title>Robust Constraints on the Physics of the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A from Optical Depth Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brightest-of-all-time gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 221009A, is the first GRB observed to have emission line (up to 37 MeV) in its prompt emission spectra. It is naturally explained as \pair annihilation line that was Doppler boosted in the relativistic jet of the GRB. In this work, we repeatedly apply the simple optical depth argument to different physical processes necessary to produce an observable \pair annihilation line. This approach results in robust constraints on the physics of the line: We conclude that in GRB 221009A, the \pair pairs were produced at a radius greater than $4.3\times 10^{15}$\,cm from the central engine, and annihilated in a region between $1.4\times 10^{16}$\,cm and $4.3\times 10^{16}$\,cm. From these constraints, we established a self-consistent picture of \pair production, cooling, and annihilation. We also derived a criterion for pair production in the GRB prompt emission: $E_{\rm{iso}} \gtrsim3.3\times 10^{53} E_{\rm{peak},100} (1+z) R^2_{\rm{prod},16}~\text{erg}$. Using this criterion, we find tens of candidate GRBs that could have produced \pair in prompt emissions to annihilate. GRB 221009A is with the highest likelihood according to this criterion. We also predict the presence of a thermal radiation, with a time-evolving black body temperature, sweeping through soft X-ray during the prompt emission phase.</description>

      <title>Dual Jet Interaction, Magnetically Arrested Flows, and Flares in Accreting Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes in galactic centers are potential multimessenger sources in gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation. To find such objects, isolating unique electromagnetic signatures of their accretion flow is key. With the aid of three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that utilize an approximate, semi-analytic, super-imposed spacetime metric, we identify two such signatures for merging binaries. Both involve magnetic reconnection and are analogous to plasma processes observed in the solar corona. The first, like colliding flux tubes that can cause solar flares, involves colliding jets that form an extended reconnection layer, dissipating magnetic energy and causing the two jets to merge. The second, akin to coronal mass ejection events, involves the accretion of magnetic field lines onto both black holes; these magnetic fields then twist, inflate, and form a trailing current sheet, ultimately reconnecting and driving a hot outflow. We provide estimates for the associated electromagnetic emission for both processes, showing that they likely accelerate electrons to high energies and are promising candidates for continuous, stochastic, and/or quasi-periodic higher energy electromagnetic emission. We also show that the accretion flows around each black hole can display features associated with the magnetically arrested state. However, simulations with black hole spins misaligned with the orbital plane and simulations with larger Bondi radii saturate at lower values of horizon-penetrating magnetic flux than standard magnetically arrested disks, leading to weaker, intermittent jets due to feedback from the weak jets or equatorial flux tubes ejected by reconnecting field lines near the horizon.</description>

      <title>SAGUARO: Time-domain Infrastructure for the Fourth Gravitational-wave Observing Run and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present upgraded infrastructure for Searches after Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) during LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave (GW) observing run (O4). These upgrades implement many of the lessons we learned after a comprehensive analysis of potential electromagnetic counterparts to the GWs discovered during the previous observing run. We have developed a new web-based target and observation manager (TOM) that allows us to coordinate sky surveys, vet potential counterparts, and trigger follow-up observations from one centralized portal. The TOM includes software that aggregates all publicly available information on the light curves and possible host galaxies of targets, allowing us to rule out potential contaminants like active galactic nuclei, variable stars, solar-system objects, and preexisting supernovae, as well as to assess the viability of any plausible counterparts. We have also upgraded our image-subtraction pipeline by assembling deeper reference images and training a new neural network-based real-bogus classifier. These infrastructure upgrades will aid coordination by enabling the prompt reporting of observations, discoveries, and analysis to the GW follow-up community, and put SAGUARO in an advantageous position to discover kilonovae in the remainder of O4 and beyond. Many elements of our open-source software stack have broad utility beyond multimessenger astronomy, and will be particularly relevant in the "big data" era of transient discoveries by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Gaia BH1 and BH2 -- evolutionary models with overshooting of the black hole progenitors within the present-day binary separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three black holes (BHs) in wide binaries - Gaia BH1, BH2 and BH3 - were recently discovered. The likely progenitors of the BHs were massive stars that experienced a supergiant phase, reaching radii of ~1000 Rsun, before collapsing to form the BH. Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day orbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively. In this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not necessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed overshooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope, produce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of supergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the absence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than the highest luminosity of main-sequence stars. We propose that the evolution that led to the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2 simply did not involve an expansion to the cool supergiant phase.</description>

      <title>Measurement of attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers from 0.3 to 30 PeV with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers provides important information regarding the generation and development of air showers. This information can be used not only to improve the description of such showers but also to test fundamental models of hadronic interactions. Using data from the LHAASO-KM2A experiment, the development of the muon content in high-energy air showers was studied. The attenuation length of muon content in the air showers was measured from experimental data in the energy range from 0.3 to 30 PeV using the constant intensity cut method. By comparing the attenuation length of the muon content with predictions from high-energy hadronic interaction models (QGSJET-II-04, SIBYLL 2.3d, and EPOS-LHC), it is evident that LHAASO results are significantly shorter than those predicted by the first two models (QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d) but relatively close to those predicted by the third model (EPOS-LHC). Thus, the LHAASO data favor the EPOS-LHC model over the other two models. The three interaction models confirmed an increasing trend in the attenuation length as the cosmic-ray energy increases.</description>
