      <title>Distribution-Agnostic Database De-Anonymization Under Obfuscation And Synchronization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Database de-anonymization typically involves matching an anonymized database with correlated publicly available data. Existing research focuses either on practical aspects without requiring knowledge of the data distribution yet provides limited guarantees, or on theoretical aspects assuming known distributions. This paper aims to bridge these two approaches, offering theoretical guarantees for database de-anonymization under synchronization errors and obfuscation without prior knowledge of data distribution. Using a modified replica detection algorithm and a new seeded deletion detection algorithm, we establish sufficient conditions on the database growth rate for successful matching, demonstrating a double-logarithmic seed size relative to row size is sufficient for detecting deletions in the database. Importantly, our findings indicate that these sufficient de-anonymization conditions are tight and are the same as in the distribution-aware setting, avoiding asymptotic performance loss due to unknown distributions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms through simulations, confirming their effectiveness in more practical, non-asymptotic, scenarios.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Redundancy of Information from a Source Failure Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a new measure of the redundancy of information from a fault tolerance perspective. The partial information decomposition (PID) emerged last decade as a framework for decomposing the multi-source mutual information $I(T;X_1, ..., X_n)$ into atoms of redundant, synergistic, and unique information. It built upon the notion of redundancy/synergy from McGill's interaction information (McGill 1954). Separately, the redundancy of system components has served as a principle of fault tolerant engineering, for sensing, routing, and control applications. Here, redundancy is understood as the level of duplication necessary for the fault tolerant performance of a system. With these two perspectives in mind, we propose a new PID-based measure of redundancy $I_{\text{ft}}$, based upon the presupposition that redundant information is robust to individual source failures. We demonstrate that this new measure satisfies the common PID axioms from (Williams 2010). In order to do so, we establish an order-reversing correspondence between collections of source-fallible instantiations of a system, on the one hand, and the PID lattice from (Williams 2010), on the other.</description>

      <title>The Meta Distribution of the SIR in Joint Communication and Sensing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel mathematical framework for assessing the performance of joint communication and sensing (JCAS) in wireless networks, employing stochastic geometry as an analytical tool. We focus on deriving the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for JCAS networks. This approach enables a fine-grained quantification of individual user or radar performance intrinsic to these networks. Our work involves the modeling of JCAS networks and the derivation of mathematical expressions for the JCAS SIR meta distribution. Through simulations, we validate both our theoretical analysis and illustrate how the JCAS SIR meta distribution varies with the network deployment density.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Joint Beamforming and Antenna Movement Design for Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-receiver communication system enabled by movable antennas (MAs). Specifically, the transmit beamforming and the double-side antenna movement at the transceiver are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of all receivers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Since the formulated problem is non-convex with highly coupled variables, conventional optimization methods cannot solve it efficiently. To address these challenges, an effective learning-based algorithm is proposed, namely heterogeneous multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), which incorporates two agents to learn policies for beamforming and movement of MAs, respectively. Based on the offline learning under numerous imperfect CSI, the proposed heterogeneous MADDPG can output the solutions for transmit beamforming and antenna movement in real time. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the MA can significantly improve the sum-rate performance of multiple receivers compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Open Experimental Measurements of Sub-6GHz Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two datasets that we make publicly available for research. The data is collected in a testbed comprised of a custom-made Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) prototype and two regular OFDM transceivers within an anechoic chamber. First, we discuss the details of the testbed and equipment used, including insights about the design and implementation of our RIS prototype. We further present the methodology we employ to gather measurement samples, which consists of letting the RIS electronically steer the signal reflections from an OFDM transmitter toward a specific location. To this end, we evaluate a suitably designed configuration codebook and collect measurement samples of the received power with an OFDM receiver. Finally, we present the resulting datasets, their format, and examples of exploiting this data for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Construction of quantum codes from $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q=p^m$ elements where $p$ is a prime and $m$ is a positive integer. This paper considers $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic codes over a class of finite commutative non-chain rings $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}=\mathbb{F}_q[v_1,v_2,\dots,v_s]/\langle v_i-v_i^2,v_iv_j=v_jv_i=0\rangle$ where $\gamma$ is an automorphism of $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$, $\Delta$ is a $\gamma$-derivation of $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$ and $1\leq i\neq j\leq s$ for a positive integer $s$. Here, we show that a $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic code of length $n$ over $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$ is the direct sum of $(\theta,\Im)$-cyclic codes of length $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\theta$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\Im$ is a $\theta$-derivation of $\mathbb{F}_q$. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions for both $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic and $(\theta,\Im)$-cyclic codes to contain their Euclidean duals are established. Finally, we obtain many quantum codes by applying the dual containing criterion on the Gray images of these codes. The obtained codes have better parameters than those available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Information Plane Analysis Visualization in Deep Learning via Transfer Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a feedforward network, Transfer Entropy (TE) can be used to measure the influence that one layer has on another by quantifying the information transfer between them during training. According to the Information Bottleneck principle, a neural model's internal representation should compress the input data as much as possible while still retaining sufficient information about the output. Information Plane analysis is a visualization technique used to understand the trade-off between compression and information preservation in the context of the Information Bottleneck method by plotting the amount of information in the input data against the compressed representation. The claim that there is a causal link between information-theoretic compression and generalization, measured by mutual information, is plausible, but results from different studies are conflicting. In contrast to mutual information, TE can capture temporal relationships between variables. To explore such links, in our novel approach we use TE to quantify information transfer between neural layers and perform Information Plane analysis. We obtained encouraging experimental results, opening the possibility for further investigations.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for probabilistic one-way secret-key distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic one-way distillable secret key is equal to the largest expected rate at which perfect secret key bits can be probabilistically distilled from a bipartite state by means of local operations and one-way classical communication. Here we define the set of super two-extendible states and prove that an arbitrary state in this set cannot be used for probabilistic one-way secret-key distillation. This broad class of states includes both erased states and all full-rank states. Comparing the probabilistic one-way distillable secret key with the more commonly studied approximate one-way distillable secret key, our results demonstrate an extreme gap between them for many states of interest, with the approximate one-way distillable secret key being much larger. Our findings naturally extend to probabilistic one-way entanglement distillation, with similar conclusions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ denote a generative language model. Let $r$ denote a reward model that returns a scalar that captures the degree at which a draw from $p$ is preferred. The goal of language model alignment is to alter $p$ to a new distribution $\phi$ that results in a higher expected reward while keeping $\phi$ close to $p.$ A popular alignment method is the KL-constrained reinforcement learning (RL), which chooses a distribution $\phi_\Delta$ that maximizes $E_{\phi_{\Delta}} r(y)$ subject to a relative entropy constraint $KL(\phi_\Delta || p) \leq \Delta.$ Another simple alignment method is best-of-$N$, where $N$ samples are drawn from $p$ and one with highest reward is selected. In this paper, we offer a closed-form characterization of the optimal KL-constrained RL solution. We demonstrate that any alignment method that achieves a comparable trade-off between KL divergence and reward must approximate the optimal KL-constrained RL solution in terms of relative entropy. To further analyze the properties of alignment methods, we introduce two simplifying assumptions: we let the language model be memoryless, and the reward model be linear. Although these assumptions may not reflect complex real-world scenarios, they enable a precise characterization of the asymptotic behavior of both the best-of-$N$ alignment, and the KL-constrained RL method, in terms of information-theoretic quantities. We prove that the reward of the optimal KL-constrained RL solution satisfies a large deviation principle, and we fully characterize its rate function. We also show that the rate of growth of the scaled cumulants of the reward is characterized by a proper Renyi cross entropy. Finally, we show that best-of-$N$ is asymptotically equivalent to KL-constrained RL solution by proving that their expected rewards are asymptotically equal, and concluding that the two distributions must be close in KL divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wiretap channel, where the individual channel uses have memory or are influenced by an adversary. We analyze the explicit and computationally efficient construction of information-theoretically secure coding schemes which use the inverse of an extractor and an error-correcting code. These schemes are known to achieve secrecy capacity on a large class of memoryless wiretap channels. We show that this also holds for certain channel types with memory. In particular, they can achieve secrecy capacity on channels where an adversary can pick a sequence of ``states'' governing the channel's behavior, as long as, given every possible state, the channel is strongly symmetric.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Wireless Device-Edge Co-Inference via the Directed Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important use case of next-generation wireless systems is device-edge co-inference, where a semantic task is partitioned between a device and an edge server. The device carries out data collection and partial processing of the data, while the remote server completes the given task based on information received from the device. It is often required that processing and communication be run as efficiently as possible at the device, while more computing resources are available at the edge. To address such scenarios, we introduce a new system solution, termed neuromorphic wireless device-edge co-inference. According to it, the device runs sensing, processing, and communication units using neuromorphic hardware, while the server employs conventional radio and computing technologies. The proposed system is designed using a transmitter-centric information-theoretic criterion that targets a reduction of the communication overhead, while retaining the most relevant information for the end-to-end semantic task of interest. Numerical results on standard data sets validate the proposed architecture, and a preliminary testbed realization is reported.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs of girth 5 and 6 and coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximum number of edges in an $N$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph with girth $g$ where $g \in \{5,6 \}$. Writing $\textrm{ex}_r ( N, \mathcal{C}_{&lt;g} )$ for this maximum, it is shown that $\textrm{ex}_r ( N , \mathcal{C}_{ &lt; 5} ) = \Omega_r ( N^{3/2 - o(1)} )$ for $r \in \{4,5,6 \}$. We address an unproved claim from [31] asserting a technique of Ruzsa can be used to show that this lower bound holds for all $r \geq 3$. We carefully explain one of the main obstacles that was overlooked at the time the claim from [31] was made, and show that this obstacle can be overcome when $r\in \{4,5,6\}$. We use constructions from coding theory to prove nontrivial lower bounds that hold for all $r \geq 3$. Finally, we use a recent result of Conlon, Fox, Sudakov, and Zhao to show that the sphere packing bound from coding theory may be improved when upper bounding the size of linear $q$-ary codes of distance $6$.</description>

      <title>Fast and Adaptive Questionnaires for Voting Advice Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Voting Advice Applications (VAA) is often compromised by the length of their questionnaires. To address user fatigue and incomplete responses, some applications (such as the Swiss Smartvote) offer a condensed version of their questionnaire. However, these condensed versions can not ensure the accuracy of recommended parties or candidates, which we show to remain below 40%. To tackle these limitations, this work introduces an adaptive questionnaire approach that selects subsequent questions based on users' previous answers, aiming to enhance recommendation accuracy while reducing the number of questions posed to the voters. Our method uses an encoder and decoder module to predict missing values at any completion stage, leveraging a two-dimensional latent space reflective of political science's traditional methods for visualizing political orientations. Additionally, a selector module is proposed to determine the most informative subsequent question based on the voter's current position in the latent space and the remaining unanswered questions. We validated our approach using the Smartvote dataset from the Swiss Federal elections in 2019, testing various spatial models and selection methods to optimize the system's predictive accuracy. Our findings indicate that employing the IDEAL model both as encoder and decoder, combined with a PosteriorRMSE method for question selection, significantly improves the accuracy of recommendations, achieving 74% accuracy after asking the same number of questions as in the condensed version.</description>

      <title>Satellite Federated Edge Learning: Architecture Design and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite networks leads to the generation of vast volumes of remote sensing data which is traditionally transferred to the ground server for centralized processing, raising privacy and bandwidth concerns. Federated edge learning (FEEL), as a distributed machine learning approach, has the potential to address these challenges by sharing only model parameters instead of raw data. Although promising, the dynamics of LEO networks, characterized by the high mobility of satellites and short ground-to-satellite link (GSL) duration, pose unique challenges for FEEL. Notably, frequent model transmission between the satellites and ground incurs prolonged waiting time and large transmission latency. This paper introduces a novel FEEL algorithm, named FEDMEGA, tailored to LEO mega-constellation networks. By integrating inter-satellite links (ISL) for intra-orbit model aggregation, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the usage of low data rate and intermittent GSL. Our proposed method includes a ring all-reduce based intra-orbit aggregation mechanism, coupled with a network flow-based transmission scheme for global model aggregation, which enhances transmission efficiency. Theoretical convergence analysis is provided to characterize the algorithm performance. Extensive simulations show that our FEDMEGA algorithm outperforms existing satellite FEEL algorithms, exhibiting an approximate 30% improvement in convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Efficient Syndrome Decoder for Heavy Hexagonal QECC via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error syndromes for heavy hexagonal code and other topological codes such as surface code have typically been decoded by using Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) based methods. Recent advances have shown that topological codes can be efficiently decoded by deploying machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular with neural networks. In this work, we first propose an ML based decoder for heavy hexagonal code and establish its efficiency in terms of the values of threshold and pseudo-threshold, for various noise models. We show that the proposed ML based decoding method achieves $\sim5 \times$ higher values of threshold than that for MWPM.
  Next, exploiting the property of subsystem codes, we define gauge equivalence for heavy hexagonal code, by which two distinct errors can belong to the same error class. A linear search based method is proposed for determining the equivalent error classes. This provides a quadratic reduction in the number of error classes to be considered for both bit flip and phase flip errors, and thus a further improvement of $\sim 14\%$ in the threshold over the basic ML decoder. Lastly, a novel technique based on rank to determine the equivalent error classes is presented, which is empirically faster than the one based on linear search.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Maximum Power Association Policy for Cellular Networks Using Distance and Angular Coordinates</title>

Abstract: A novel stochastic geometry framework is proposed in this paper to study the downlink coverage performance in a millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network by jointly considering the polar coordinates of the Base Stations (BSs) with respect to the typical user located at the origin. Specifically, both the Euclidean and the angular distances of the BSs in a maximum power-based association policy for the UE are considered to account for realistic beam management considerations, which have been largely ignored in the literature, especially in the cell association phase. For completeness, two other association schemes are considered and exact-form expressions for the coverage probability are derived. Subsequently, the key role of angular distances is highlighted by defining the dominant interferer using angular distance-based criteria instead of Euclidean distance-based, and conducting a dominant interferer-based coverage probability analysis. Among others, the numerical results revealed that considering angular distance-based criteria for determining both the serving and the dominant interfering BS, can approximate the coverage performance more accurately as compared to utilizing Euclidean distance-based criteria. To the best of the authors$'$ knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously explores the role of angular distances in the association policy and analysis of cellular networks.</description>

      <title>A Causal Model for Quantifying Multipartite Classical and Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16414</link>

Abstract: We give an operational definition of information-theoretic resources within a given multipartite classical or quantum correlation. We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation. Subsequently, we present a novel quantum secrecy monotone and investigate a quantum hybrid key distribution system as an extension of our causal model. Finally, we discuss some connections to optimal transport (OT) problem.</description>

      <title>Game of Coding: Beyond Trusted Majorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coding theory revolves around the incorporation of redundancy into transmitted symbols, computation tasks, and stored data to guard against adversarial manipulation. However, error correction in coding theory is contingent upon a strict trust assumption. In the context of computation and storage, it is required that honest nodes outnumber adversarial ones by a certain margin. However, in several emerging real-world cases, particularly, in decentralized blockchain-oriented applications, such assumptions are often unrealistic. Consequently, despite the important role of coding in addressing significant challenges within decentralized systems, its applications become constrained. Still, in decentralized platforms, a distinctive characteristic emerges, offering new avenues for secure coding beyond the constraints of conventional methods. In these scenarios, the adversary benefits when the legitimate decoder recovers the data, and preferably with a high estimation error. This incentive motivates them to act rationally, trying to maximize their gains. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic formulation for coding, called the game of coding, that captures this unique dynamic where each of the adversary and the data collector (decoder) have a utility function to optimize. The utility functions reflect the fact that both the data collector and the adversary are interested in increasing the chance of data being recoverable by the data collector. Moreover, the utility functions express the interest of the data collector to estimate the input with lower estimation error, but the opposite interest of the adversary. As a first, still highly non-trivial step, we characterize the equilibrium of the game for the repetition code with a repetition factor of 2, for a wide class of utility functions with minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fractal spatio-temporal scale-free messaging: amplitude modulation of self-executable carriers given by the Weierstrass function's components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06633v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many communication contexts, the capabilities of the involved actors cannot be known beforehand, whether it is a cell, a plant, an insect, or even a life form unknown to Earth. Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Precoding and Combining for mmWave Full-Duplex Joint Radar and Communication Systems under Self-Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14942</link>

Abstract: In the context of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), a full-duplex (FD) transceiver can operate as a monostatic radar while maintaining communication capabilities. This paper investigates the design of precoders and combiners for a joint radar and communication (JRC) system at mmWave frequencies. The primary goal of the design is to guarantee certain performance in terms of some sensing and communication metrics while minimizing the self-interference (SI) caused by FD operation and taking into account the hardware limitations coming from a hybrid MIMO architecture. Specifically, we introduce a generalized eigenvalue-based precoder design that considers the downlink user rate, the radar gain, and the SI suppression. Since the hybrid analog/digital architecture degrades the SI mitigation capability of the precoder, we further enhance SI suppression with the analog combiner. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves the required radar gain and SI mitigation while incurring a small loss in downlink spectral efficiency. Additionally, the numerical experiments also show that the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar with the proposed beamforming architecture results in highly accurate range and velocity estimates for the detected targets.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric inference of higher order interaction patterns in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining parsimonious decompositions of networks into higher order interactions which can take the form of arbitrary motifs.The method is based on a class of analytically solvable generative models, where vertices are connected via explicit copies of motifs, which in combination with non-parametric priors allow us to infer higher order interactions from dyadic graph data without any prior knowledge on the types or frequencies of such interactions. Crucially, we also consider 'degree--corrected' models that correctly reflect the degree distribution of the network and consequently prove to be a better fit for many real world--networks compared to non-degree corrected models. We test the presented approach on simulated data for which we recover the set of underlying higher order interactions to a high degree of accuracy. For empirical networks the method identifies concise sets of atomic subgraphs from within thousands of candidates that cover a large fraction of edges and include higher order interactions of known structural and functional significance. The method not only produces an explicit higher order representation of the network but also a fit of the network to analytically tractable models opening new avenues for the systematic study of higher order network structures.</description>
