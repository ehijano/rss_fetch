      <title>Topological aspects of zero modes in cavity resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the zero modes of electromagnetic fields in a cavity resonator and the cavity's topological characteristics. We show that the dimension of the electromagnetic zero-mode space coincides with the dimension of the corresponding homology group of the cavity. Moreover, we prove that the alternating sum of the dimensions of the electromagnetic zero-mode spaces is closely related to the Euler characteristic of the cavity boundary, and hence to the integral of the curvature.</description>

      <title>Development of next-generation light-weight ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study reports the design of advanced light-weight materials for high-energy accelerator beampipe applications. The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package. Our results show that, although the elastic moduli ($E$) of the investigated Mg-Al-Li alloys are comparable to those of conventional beampipe materials, their significantly higher radiation lengths ($X_0$) lead to an overall improvement in the figure of merit $X_0 E^{1/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview about aspects of mechanical engineering of undulators. It is based mainly on two types that are used in the SwissFEL facility. The U15 Undulator is an example of an in-vacuum type and the UE38 is an APPLE-X type.

      <title>Demonstration of a novel phase space painting method in a coupled lattice to mitigate space charge in high-intensity hadron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13517v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-turn charge-exchange injection is the primary method of creating high-intensity hadron beams in circular accelerators, and phase space painting during injection enables tailoring of the accumulated phase space distribution. A technique we call eigenpainting allows injection of particles into a single mode of a coupled ring, providing full four-dimensional control of the phase space distribution. Under ideal conditions, uniform eigenpainting generates a linear-force equilibrium distribution in the transverse plane, with zero volume in four-dimensional transverse phase space, even including space charge. We have implemented eigenpainting for the first time in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Accumulator Ring. Injecting 8.8 $\mu$C of 800 MeV beam, we obtain a final ratio of intrinsic transverse emittances of $\approx$2.4. We analyze the effect of space charge on the final distribution through comparison of the reconstructed phase space to particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and its Application to Nonlinear Beam Dynamics: Comparison of Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rarely used Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been utilized as an elegant way to find the trajectories of mechanical systems and to derive symplectic maps. Further, the exact solution in kick approximation of Hamilton's equations of motion in interaction representation is written as a generalized one-turn twist map.
  One can imagine that the nonlinear kick comes first, followed by the one-period rotation along the machine circumference, or a second alternative in which the one-period rotation occurs before the kick. There is a difference in the result of solving Hamilton's equations between the two cases, which is expressed in obtaining a standard forward twist map in the first case, or alternatively a backward map in the second one. This nontrivial and intuitively unclear peculiarity is usually ignored/overlooked in practically all specialized references on the topic.
  Finally, the statistical properties and the behavior of the density distribution of a particle beam in configuration space under the influence of an isolated sextupole have been studied.</description>

      <title>Toward Ultra-fast Treatments: Large Energy Acceptance Beam Delivery Systems and Opportunities for Proton Beam Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treatment delivery is largely determined by capabilities of the beam delivery system (BDS), where faster delivery can have many potential benefits including improved dosimetric quality, utility, cost effectiveness, patient throughput and comfort. Despite significant developments in accelerators, delivery methodologies, dose optimisation and more, the energy layer switching time (ELST) is still a persisting limitation in existing BDS. The ELST can contribute significantly to beam delivery time (BDT) and extend treatment times, requiring compensation by optimisation planning approaches, motion mitigation strategies, or active beam modification. This fundamental constraint can be addressed by increasing the narrow energy acceptance range of conventional beamlines to minimise the ELST, enabling ultra-fast delivery. A large energy acceptance (LEA) BDS has the potential to revolutionise PBT through immediate improvements to current treatment delivery and emerging delivery modalities: the complete exploitation of PBT - and unlocking its full potential - can only be made possible with advances in beam delivery technologies. We review the abundant opportunities offered by an ultra-fast BDS: shorter treatment times, reduced motion induced dose degradation, improved effectiveness of motion management techniques, possibilities for volumetric rescanning, bidirectional delivery, further planning optimisation, and novel delivery strategies. We overview the design concepts of several LEA proposals, technology requirements, and also discuss the remaining challenges and considerations with realising a LEA BDS in practice. There are multiple avenues requiring further development and study, however the clinical potential and benefits of this enabling technology are clear: ultra-fast delivery offers both immediate and future improvements to PBT treatments.</description>

      <title>A detailed and unified treatment of spin-orbit systems using tools distilled from the theory of bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:1501.02747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We return to our study \cite{BEH} of invariant spin fields and spin tunes for polarized beams in storage rings but in contrast to the continuous-time treatment in \cite{BEH}, we now employ a discrete-time formalism, beginning with the $\rm{Poincar\acute{e}}$ maps of the continuous time formalism. We then substantially extend our toolset and generalize the notions of invariant spin field and invariant frame field. We revisit some old theorems and prove several theorems believed to be new. In particular we study two transformation rules, one of them known and the other new, where the former turns out to be an $SO(3)$-gauge transformation rule. We then apply the theory to the dynamics of spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ particle bunches and their density matrix functions, describing semiclassically the particle-spin content of bunches. Our approach thus unifies the spin-vector dynamics from the T-BMT equation with the spin-tensor dynamics and other dynamics. This unifying aspect of our approach relates the examples elegantly and uncovers relations between the various underlying dynamical systems in a transparent way. As in \cite{BEH}, the particle motion is integrable but we now allow for nonlinear particle motion on each torus. Since this work is inspired by notions from the theory of bundles, we also provide insight into the underlying bundle-theoretic aspects of the well-established concepts of invariant spin field, spin tune and invariant frame field. Since we neglect, as is usual, the Stern-Gerlach force, the underlying principal bundle is of product formso that we can present the theory in a fashion which does not use bundle theory. Nevertheless we occasionally mention the bundle-theoretic meaningof our concepts and we also mention the similarities with the geometrical approach to Yang-Mills Theory.</description>

      <title>AttoSHINE: Generation of continuous-wave terawatt-scale attosecond X-ray pulses at SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07213v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are a critical tool for tracking ultrafast electron dynamics in condensed matter, molecular systems, and strongly correlated materials. Recent breakthroughs have pushed X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) into the attosecond domain, significantly surpassing their previous femtosecond capabilities. Building on these advancements, this work investigates the potential of the Shanghai High Repetition Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility (SHINE), China's first continuous-wave (CW) XFEL, to generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses, thereby offering transformative capabilities for X-ray science. Through comprehensive start-to-end simulations, we show that SHINE is capable of producing hard X-ray pulses with peak powers reaching the terawatt-scale and average pulse durations of approximately 300 as. This is achieved using a self-chirping scheme within the existing machine configuration, requiring no additional hardware. Our findings demonstrate that CW XFELs can generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates, opening new opportunities for real-time studies of electronic dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-color XFEL pulses with variable color separation and time delay for multi-frame diffraction imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators. The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure, providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In anticipation of the completion of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) programme by the end of 2041, CERN is preparing to launch a new major facility in the mid-2040s. According to the 2020 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), the highest-priority next collider is an electron-positron Higgs factory, followed in the longer term by a hadron-hadron collider at the highest achievable energy. The CERN directorate established a Future Colliders Comparative Evaluation working group in June 2023. This group brings together project leaders and domain experts to conduct a consistent evaluation of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and alternative scenarios based on shared assumptions and standardized criteria. This report presents a comparative evaluation of proposed future collider projects submitted as input for the Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. These proposals are compared considering main performance parameters, environmental impact and sustainability, technical maturity, cost of construction and operation, required human resources, and realistic implementation timelines. An overview of the international collider projects within a similar timeframe, notably the CEPC in China and the ILC in Japan is also presented, as well as a short review of the status and prospects of new accelerator techniques.</description>

      <title>A Neutron Microscope Using a Nested Wolter-I Condenser and a Bank of Diffractive-Refractive Achromatic Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a nested Wolter-I mirror design for a neutron condenser, which is based on established X-ray telescope technology. We demonstrate through simulations that it can increase the flux density at the ESS imaging instrument ODIN by up to two orders of magnitude. Experimental measurements of reflectivity and figure errors on a prototype mirror element confirm the technical feasibility of the approach. Then, we discuss design strategies for an imaging objective to fully exploit the condenser specifications while achieving spatial resolutions comparable to those of X-ray micro-CT instruments. Analytically, we show that for monochromatic beams suitable solutions exist employing arrays of hundreds of identical objectives, realized either as compound refractive lenses (CRLs) or Fresnel zone plates (FZPs). To mitigate the inherent chromatic aberration of these optics, each individual objective could be replaced by an achromatic FZP/CRL combination. Key optical properties of the resulting microscope are estimated. This novel full-field microscopy concept for highly divergent, polychromatic neutron beams has the potential to improve temporal and spatial resolution for large samples and sample environments and to enable the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of projections in neutron tomography.</description>
