      <title>Case Studies of Using the Partial-Structure R1 and the Single-Atom R1 to Assemble Small-Molecule Crystal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how pre-knowledge of a crystal structure, including the constituent fragments, the atomic connectivity, and the approximate bond lengths, etc., can be utilized in the partial-structure R1 (pR1) and the single-atom R1 (sR1) calculations. It has been shown that taking advantage of pre-known information the calculations can proceed in an orderly and well-planned manner. Furthermore, in the case of the sR1 calculation, computer time can also be greatly reduced. Because the pR1 calculation is more time-consuming than the sR1 calculation, when there is a choice between the pR1 and the sR1, the former should be avoided. So, the usual strategy of assembling a light-atom-only structure should start with the normal sR1 method to determine a basic framework of the structure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 method to complete the model. However, when the data resolution is low, the first step is necessary to use the pR1 method to assemble the known fragments. For a heavy-atom-containing structure, the correct strategy starts with the normal sR1 method to determine the heavy-atom substructure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 to complete the model.</description>

      <title>Surface Modification and Subsequent Fermi Density Enhancement of Bi(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects introduced to the surface of Bi(111) break the translational symmetry and modify the surface states locally. We present a theoretical and experimental study of the 2D defects on the surface of Bi(111) and the states that they induce. Bi crystals cleaved in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at low temperature (110 K) and the resulting ion-etched surface are investigated by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) as well as spectroscopy (STS) techniques in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. STS measurements of cleaved Bi(111) reveal that a commonly observed bilayer step edge has a lower density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level as compared to the atomic-flat terrace. Following ion bombardment, the Bi(111) surface reveals anomalous behavior at both 110 and 300 K: Surface periodicity is observed by LEED, and a significant increase in the number of bilayer step edges and energetically unfavorable monolayer steps is observed by STM. It is suggested that the newly exposed monolayer steps and the type A bilayer step edges result in an increase to the surface Fermi density as evidenced by UPS measurements and the Kohn-Sham DOS. These states appear to be thermodynamically stable under UHV conditions.</description>

      <title>Graph-Theoretical Description and Continuity Problems for Stress Propagation Through Complex Strut Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnected networks of rigid struts are critical for application in lightweight, load-bearing structures. However, accurately modeling stress distribution in these strut lattices poses significant computational challenges due to its strong dependence on organizational patterns, boundary conditions, and collective effects. Leveraging two-dimensional strut lattices that enable visualization of local elastic deformation, we investigate how graph theory (GT) provides a framework for stress prediction. We investigate how the geometric features often neglected by GT play a crucial role in the behavior of anisotropic networks. We also address the challenge of topological continuity that arises when applying discrete mathematics to physical structures. We show that modified centrality parameters combining lattice topology with geometry more accurately predict local stress, as validated through birefringence imaging and finite element modeling. Finally, we show how further improvements are made by incorporating strut lattice boundary conditions into the centrality definition, in a manner that simultaneously simplifies the computational cost.</description>

      <title>How phonon coherence develops and contributes to heat conduction in periodic and aperiodic superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of device length on thermal conductivity in periodic and aperiodic superlattices (SLs). While it is well known that thermal conductivity in aperiodic SLs exhibits a weaker dependence on device length compared to periodic SLs, existing literature attributes this behavior to the scattering of coherent phonons by aperiodically arranged interfaces. Through atomistic wave-packet simulations, we show that coherent phonons in aperiodic SLs have spatial extensions limited to a certain number of SL layers, which prevents transmission if the extension is shorter than the device length. Specifically, the disordered interface spacing in aperiodic SLs causes coherent phonons to behave as non-propagative vibrational modes, resulting in diffuse energy transmission. In periodic SLs, however, coherent phonons can propagate across the entire structure, enabling high transmission. The difference between ballistic transport in periodic SLs and diffuse transport in aperiodic SLs is captured in the length-dependence of phonon transmission. These findings provide new insights into phonon coherence and its implications for heat conduction in superlattices, with potential applications in the thermal design of nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted canonical sampling (MLACS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acceleration of material property calculations while maintaining ab initio accuracy (1 meV/atom) is one of the major challenges in computational physics. In this paper, we introduce a Python package enhancing the computation of (finite temperature) material properties at the ab initio level using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP). The Machine-Learning Assisted Canonical Sampling (MLACS) method, grounded in a self-consistent variational approach, iteratively trains a MLIP using an active learning strategy in order to significantly reduce the computational cost of ab initio simulations.
  MLACS offers a modular and user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT) codes, MLIP potentials, and molecular dynamics packages, enabling a wide range of applications, while maintaining a near-DFT accuracy. These include sampling the canonical ensemble of a system, performing free energy calculations, transition path sampling, and geometry optimization, all by utilizing surrogate MLIP potentials, in place of ab initio calculations.
  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and implementation of the MLACS method. We also demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency through various examples, showcasing the capabilities of the MLACS package.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced altermangetism in RuO$_2$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of bulk RuO$_2$ remain a subject of active debate, despite its pivotal role in the emergence of altermagnetism. The latter is a novel paradigm in magnetic phases, characterized by the absence of net magnetization due to anti-parallel alignment of magnetic moments, yet displaying finite spin-splitting in the electronic band structure. This unique behavior unlocks opportunities for advanced applications in information technology devices. Recent experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that bulk RuO$_2$, contrary to prior assumptions, is non-magnetic. In this work, we propose the fabrication of RuO$_2$ thin films to robustly stabilize the altermagnetic phase. Unlike their bulk counterparts, thin films experience substantial strain relaxation, leading to a dramatic impact on the electronic structure that triggers a transition towards an altermagnetic behavior, which mimics the impact of an artificially applied Hubbard-U correction to account for electronic correlations. Our findings promote the use and exploration of thin films for the realization of spintronic devices based on altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Frustrated magnetism in Mn films on Ag(111) surface: from chiral in-plane N\'eel state to row-wise antiferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study to explore the intricate magnetic properties of frustrated Mn monolayer on the Ag(111) surface. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy demonstrates that a N\'eel magnetic state characterizes such an interface, which contradicts systematic ab-initio predictions made in the last two decades indicating that the ground state is collinear row-wise antiferromagnetic (RW-AFM) state. Here, we employ the all-electron full-potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR) method and find that the ground state is a chiral magnetic N\'eel state, with magnetic moments rotating in the surface plane following a unique sense of rotation, as dictated by the underlying in-plane magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Once allowing disordered magnetic states, as described within the disordered local moment (DLM) approach, we reveal the possibility of stabilization of a RW-AFM state. We conjecture that at low temperatures, the chiral N\'eel state prevails, while at higher temperatures, the magnetic exchange interactions are modified by magnetic disorder, which can then induce a transition towards a RW-AFM state. Our work addresses a long term experimental-theoretical controversy and provides significant insights into the magnetic interactions and stability of Mn films on noble metal substrates, contributing to the broader understanding of the different magnetic facets of frustrated magnetism in thin films.</description>

      <title>A Decision Transformer Approach to Grain Boundary Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As microstructure property models improve, additional information from crystallographic degrees of freedom and grain boundary networks (GBNs) can be included in microstructure design problems. However, the high dimensional nature of including this information precludes the use of many common optimization approaches and requires less efficient methods to generate quality designs. Previous work demonstrated that human-in-the-loop optimization, instantiated as a video game, achieved high-quality, efficient solutions to these design problems. However, such data is expensive to obtain. In the present work, we show how a Decision Transformer machine learning (ML) model can be used to learn from the optimization trajectories generated by human players, and subsequently solve materials design problems. We compare the ML optimization trajectories against players and a common global optimization algorithm: simulated annealing (SA). We find that the ML model exhibits a validation accuracy of 84% against player decisions, and achieves solutions of comparable quality to SA (92%), but does so using three orders of magnitude fewer iterations. We find that the ML model generalizes in important and surprising ways, including the ability to train using a simple constitutive structure-property model and then solve microstructure design problems for a different, higher-fidelity, constitutive structure-property model without any retraining. These results demonstrate the potential of Decision Transformer models for the solution of materials design problems.</description>

      <title>Tailoring MBE Growth of c-Mn3Sn Directly on MgO (111): From Islands to Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our study of (0001) oriented Mn$_3$Sn (c-Mn$_3$Sn) thin films synthesized directly on an MgO (111) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. We identify a growth window where Mn$_3$Sn growth can be controlled through slight adjustments of the Mn flux, achieving either $\mu$m$^2$-sized high crystalline-quality islands or an almost completely continuous film. High-resolution X-ray diffraction results indicate that both films are highly (0001) oriented. The atomic resolution images show clear film-substrate interfaces displaying an epitaxial relationship. Scanning precession electron diffraction measurements reveal that the island featured sample has highly crystallized Mn3Sn. The sample featuring a high continuity exhibits defects in some areas but retains the dominant Mn$_3$Sn structure. This work demonstrates a potential method for synthesizing high crystalline-quality Mn3Sn films with substantial coverage, facilitating the study of Mn3Sn films without the influence of an additional buffer layer and promoting their application in integrated spintronics.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nickel-Doped Barium Titanate via Machine Learning-Accelerated Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocatalytic water splitting, which produces hydrogen and oxygen through water electrolysis, is a promising method for generating renewable, carbon-free alternative fuels. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by the high costs of Pt cathodes and IrO$_{x}$/RuO$_{x}$ anode catalysts. In the search for cost-effective alternatives, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) has emerged as a compelling candidate. This inexpensive, non-toxic perovskite oxide can be synthesized from earth-abundant precursors and has shown potential for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in recent studies. In this work, we explore the OER activity of pristine and Ni-doped BaTiO$_{3}$ at explicit water interfaces using metadynamics (MetaD) simulations. To enable efficient and practical MetaD for OER, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential based on artificial neural networks (ANN), achieving large-scale and long-time simulations with near-DFT accuracy. Our simulations reveal that Ni-doping enhances the catalytic activity of BaTiO$_{3}$ for OER, consistent with experimental observations, while providing mechanistic insights into this enhancement.</description>

      <title>Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in PbTe and SnTe: impact of the host band symmetry on doping properties by ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping properties of Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in thermoelectric and topological materials PbTe and SnTe are analyzed based on density functional theory calculations in the local density approximations and the large supercell method. In agreement with experiment, in both PbTe and SnTe, Bi is a donor and Ag is an acceptor with a vanishing magnetic moment. In contrast, Cr is a resonant donor in PbTe, and an resonant acceptor in SnTe. We also consider the electronic structure of cation vacancies in PbTe and SnTe, since these abundant native defects induce $p$-type conductivity in both hosts. The quantitatively different impact of these dopants/defects on the host band structure of PbTe and SnTe (level energies, band splittings, band inversion, and a different level of hybridization between dopant and host states) is explained based on the group-theoretical arguments.</description>

      <title>Influence of Phase Segregation on the Hysteresis of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSC) have demonstrated impressive performance improvement. Among the various characteristics, the time-dependent current-voltage (J-V) hysteresis allows a direct exploration of various critical phenomena that affect the stability of PSCs. The hysteresis is associated with various spatial heterogeneity-related phenomena, including lifetime, bandgap, and phase segregation. We investigate these phenomena through numerical simulations and quantify how the spatial non-uniformity in the perovskite active layer impacts the hysteresis. Further, we correlate the time dependent device degradation with the hysteresis trends in terms of ion density and effective carrier lifetime.</description>

Abstract: Quantum materials have been in the limelight for several years now. These materials exhibit intriguing quantum phenomena, which when harnessed properly, promise extraordinary advancements across various scientific and technological domains. To fully exploit their potential, it is imperative to synthesize such quantum materials in thin film form so that they are compatible with well-established device fabrication techniques. In this perspective, an overview of the current status and future directions of thin film quantum material synthesis is provided. The criteria for quantum materials are discussed, as well as the many benefits of preparing them as thin films.

      <title>Room-temperature nonlinear transport and microwave rectification in antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the nonlinear Hall effect provides an avenue for studying the interplay among symmetry, topology, and phase transitions, with potential applications in signal doubling and high-frequency rectification. However, practical applications require devices fabricated on large area thin film as well as room-temperature operation. Here, we demonstrate robust room-temperature nonlinear transverse response and microwave rectification in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We observe multiple sign-reversals in the nonlinear response by tuning the chemical potential. Through theoretical analysis, we identify skew scattering and side jump, arising from extrinsic spin-orbit scattering, as the main mechanisms underlying the observed nonlinear signals. Furthermore, we demonstrate radio frequency (RF) rectification in the range of 1-8 gigahertz at 300 K. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the relationship between nonlinear response and magnetism, but also expand the potential applications as energy harvesters and detectors in high-frequency scenarios.</description>

      <title>A detailed examination of polysilicon resistivity incorporating the grain size distribution</title>

Abstract: Current transport in polysilicon is a complicated process with many factors to consider. The inhomogeneous nature of polysilicon with its differently shaped and sized grains is one such consideration. We have developed a method that enhances existing resistivity models with a two-dimensional extension that incorporates the grain size distribution using a Voronoi-based resistor network. We obtain grain size distributions both from our growth simulations (700 K, 800 K, and 900 K) and experimental analysis. Applying our method, we investigate the effect that variation in grain size produces with cases of different average grain sizes (2 nm to 3 $\mu$m). For example, the resistivity of polysilicon with an average grain size of 175 nm drops from 11 k$\Omega$ $\cdot$ cm to 4.5 k$\Omega$ $\cdot$ cm when compared to conventional one-dimensional modeling. Our study highlights the strong effect of grain size variation on resistivity, revealing that wider distributions result in significant resistivity reductions of up to more than 50%. Due to the larger grains present with a grain size distribution, current transport encounters fewer grain boundaries while the average grain size remains the same resulting in fewer barriers along the current transport path. Incorporating the grain structure into the resistivity modeling facilitates a more detailed and comprehensive characterization of the electrical properties of polysilicon.</description>

Abstract: From nanoscale devices including sensors, electronics, or biocompatible coatings to macroscale structural, automotive or aerospace components, fundamental understanding of plasticity and fracture can guide the realization of materials that ensure safe and durable performance. Identifying the role of atomic-scale plasticity is crucial, especially for applications relying on brittle ceramics. Here, stress-intensity-controlled atomistic simulations of fracture in cubic Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N model systems demonstrate how $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$-scale plasticity - manifested as lattice distortions, phase transformation, nucleation and emission of dislocations - substantially affects the macroscale fracture toughness (K$_{Ic}$) and fracture strength (${\sigma}$$_{f}$) of brittle ceramics. The extent of plastic deformation in Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N increases monotonically with the Al content (x), due to a corresponding decrease in cubic $\rightarrow$ hexagonal polymorph transition energy. Overall, plasticity positively affects the mechanical properties, resulting in optimal combinations of strength and toughness for x~0.6. However, for x exceeding ~0.7, the benefits of plasticity diminish. The initial rise followed by a decline in K$_{Ic}$(x) and ${\sigma}$$_{f}$(x) is explained based on the interplay between phase transformation and tensile cleavage on the easiest fracture plane. The results highlight the impact of atomic-scale plasticity on observable properties and point to strategies for toughening ceramics through control of polymorph competition.</description>

      <title>Dynamic heterogeneity in the self-induced spin glass state of elemental neodymium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin glasses are magnetic materials exhibiting numerous magnetization patterns, that randomly vary both in real space and in time. To date, it is still not well understood what the nature of these spatiotemporal dynamics is, namely if they are completely random or if there are links between given time and length scales. Here we show the ubiquitous behavior of dynamic heterogeneity in the self-induced spin glass state of elemental neodymium. We used spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with atomistic spin dynamics simulations to image the locally ordered magnetic patterns in the glass state, and tracked the induced spatiotemporal dynamics in response to external perturbations. We observed that the real space magnetization exhibited a coexistence of slow and fast dynamics reminiscent of dynamic heterogeneity in structural glasses. Furthermore, we found that zero-field cooling imprints a specific set of metastable periodicities into the spin glass, which evolved during aging and could be thermally reinitialized. These results demonstrate the importance of local length scales for the understanding of aging dynamics in spin glasses and provide a link to the more general picture of true glasses.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary oxidation behavior of W-Zr thin-film metallic glasses: A route for tailoring functional properties of W-Zr-O films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxidation behavior of W-Zr thin-film metallic glasses (TFMGs) with 32, 48 and 61 at.% Zr, prepared by dc magnetron co-sputtering, was comprehensively studied after annealing in synthetic air. The study focuses on the effect of the annealing temperature (up to 600{\deg}C) on the oxidation process, oxygen saturation, structure evolution, and their subsequent impact on electrical, optical and mechanical properties. The findings reveal that controlled oxidation transforms W-Zr TFMGs into amorphous ceramic W-Zr-O films with substoichiometric compositions. This is a consequence of an oxidation process that does not proceed through the formation of a stoichiometric oxide layer on the surface of W-Zr TFMGs, acting as a diffusion barrier against fast oxidation, but leads to a gradual incorporation of oxygen across the film volume due to thermodynamics factors. Higher Zr content accelerates the oxygen incorporation and its depth uniformity in the films. As a result, the mechanical properties are significantly enhanced achieving hardness values of up to 17.5 GPa at approximately 50% oxygen saturation. Simultaneously, the electrical and optical properties are finely tuned with the resistivity and the extinction coefficient (measured at 550 nm) ranging from 1.7 to 95.7x10-4 Ohm.cm and 0.28 to 1.06, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single pulse All Optical Helicity-Independent Switching is demonstrated in an in-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junction. A toggle switching of the 2nm thick Co40Fe40B20 soft layer could be achieved by exchange coupling the Co40Fe40B20 with a 10nm thick Co85Gd15 layer monitored by measuring the Tunnel magneto resistance of the device. The use of in plane magnetized electrodes relaxes the constrains linked to perpendicular magnetic anisotropy systems while achieving a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio exceeding 100%. The influence of the upper electrical electrode, which is opaque to the laser beam in this study, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>QUANTUM ESPRESSO implementation of the RPA-based functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail our implementation of the random-phase-approximation based functional (RPAF) derived in our previous publication [Phys. Rev. B 110, 195151 (2024)] for the QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE) package. We also make available the source files required in order to apply this functional within QE. We also provide the corresponding RPAF projector augmented wave (PAW) and ultrasolf pseudopotentials for most elements. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the RPAF by calculating the equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus of a set of the same 60 crystals used by other authors to benchmark other functionals for both PAW and ultrasoft pseudopotentials. We find that the RPAF performs better overall as compared to the other most popular functionals.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Magnetic Structure of Spin Glass Compound $\text{Zn}_{0.5}\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Te}$ Using Real-Space Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined magnetometry, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), and neutron scattering study of the insulating spin glass Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te, for which magnetic Mn$^{2+}$ and nonmagnetic Zn$^{2+}$ ions are randomly distributed on a face-centered cubic lattice. Using magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis and reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling of the diffuse magnetic scattering, we show that the spin-glass ground state exhibits short-range type-III antiferromagnetic order with a locally ordered moment of 3.4 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ between nearest-neighbor spins, which decays as a function of spin separation distance with a correlation length of approximately 5 {\AA}. The diffuse magnetic scattering and corresponding mPDF show no significant changes across the spin-glass freezing temperature $T_f = 22$ K, indicating that the dynamically fluctuating short-range spin correlations in the paramagnetic state retain the same basic type-III configuration that characterizes the spin-glass state; the only change apparent from the neutron scattering data is a gradual reduction of the correlation length and locally ordered moment with increasing temperature. The $\mu$SR results demonstrate that fluctuation rate of the short-range spin correlations decreases gradually and somewhat inhomogeneously through the sample volume as the temperature decreases toward $T_f$. Taken together, these results provide a unique and detailed picture of the local magnetic structure and dynamics in a concentrated spin glass. In addition, this work showcases a new statistical method for extracting diffuse scattering signals from neutron powder diffraction data, which we developed to facilitate the mPDF and RMC analysis of the neutron data. This method has the potential to be broadly useful for neutron powder diffraction experiments on a variety of materials with short-range atomic or magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature Distributed Feedback CsPbBr$_3$ Perovskite Laser Integrated on a Silicon Nitride Waveguide Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs) require cost-effective laser sources that can be monolithically integrated. The low cost and low-temperature solution processability of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) make them attractive alternatives to established III-V compound semiconductors for on-chip laser sources in PICs. Cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) perovskites are emerging materials for green light-emitting diodes and lasers. To date, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at room temperature has been frequently achieved in CsPbBr$_3$ thin films, while reports on lasing are more limited. Here, we demonstrate a first-order grating distributed feedback (DFB) CsPbBr$_3$ thin-film laser operating at room temperature. Planar hot-pressed (PHP)-CsPbBr$_}$, with a low ASE threshold of 14.5 $\mu$Jcm$^{-2}$ under 0.3 nanosecond (ns) pump pulses, was monolithically integrated into a silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) waveguide platform via a compatible top-down patterning process. The first-order grating DFB PHP-CsPbBr$_3$ thin-film laser operated at 540 nm in the green spectral region, where III-V lasers have limitations, and exhibited a lasing threshold of 0.755 mJcm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. This work marks a significant step toward utilizing MHPs for on-chip green lasers in PICs for commercial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity into group IV elements by doping has long promised a pathway to introduce quantum functionalities into well-established semiconductor technologies. The non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into Si or Ge has successfully shown superconductivity can be achieved, however, the origin of superconductivity has been obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations (n$_{h}$ = 4.15 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of T$_{C}$ = 3.5 K, and an out-of-plane critical field of 1 T at 270 mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a flat band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</description>

      <title>Learning charges and long-range interactions from energies and forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of long-range forces is critical in atomistic simulations, as they play a central role in determining the properties of materials and chemical systems. However, standard machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often rely on short-range approximations, limiting their applicability to systems with significant electrostatics and dispersion forces. We recently introduced the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which captures long-range electrostatics without explicitly learning atomic charges or charge equilibration. Extending LES, we incorporate the ability to learn physical partial charges, encode charge states, and the option to impose charge neutrality constraints. We benchmark LES on diverse and challenging systems, including charged molecules, ionic liquid, electrolyte solution, polar dipeptides, surface adsorption, electrolyte/solid interfaces, and solid-solid interfaces. Our results show that LES can effectively infer physical partial charges, dipole and quadrupole moments, as well as achieve better accuracy compared to methods that explicitly learn charges. LES thus provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable MLIP framework for simulating complex systems with intricate charge transfer and long-range</description>

      <title>Scattering-Based Structural Inversion of Soft Materials via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques are indispensable tools for probing the structure of soft materials. However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions -- two representative soft matter systems -- we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Graphene: Theoretical Study of Multi-photon Non-linear Absorption Coefficient of a Strong Electromagnetic Wave by Using Quantum Kinetic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the quantum kinetic equation for electrons, we theoretically study the quantum multi-photon non-linear absorption of a strong electromagnetic wave (EMW) in two-dimensional graphene. Two cases of the electron scattering mechanism are considered: Electron-optical phonon scattering and electron-acoustic phonon scattering. The general multi-photon absorption coefficient is presented as a function of the temperature, the external magnetic field, the photon energy and the amplitude of external EMW. These analytical expressions for multi-photon non-linear absorption coefficient (MNAC) are numerically calculated and the results are discussed in both the absence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet. The results show that there is no absorption peak in the absence of the magnetic field, which contrasts with previous results in 2D systems such as quantum wells or superlattices. However, when there is a strong magnetic field along the direction perpendicular to the 2D graphene, absorption spectral lines appear consistent with the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. Our calculations show that the MPA's effect is stronger than mono-photon absorption. Besides, the quantum multi-photon non-linear absorption phenomenon has been studied from low to high temperatures. This transcends the limits of the classical BKE which is studied in the high-temperature domain. The computational results show that the dependence of MNAC on the above quantities is consistent with the previous theoretical investigation. Another novel feature of this work is that the general analytic expression for MNAC shows the Half Width at Half Maximum dependence on the magnetic field which is in good agreement with the previous experimental observations. Thus, our estimation might give a critical prediction for future experimental observations in 2D graphene.</description>

Abstract: A novel approach for the measurement of the Nitrogen active species generated by a plasma source in the molecular beam epitaxy environment is here presented. The method is based on the analysis of the variations in the optical signal measured by a pyrometer during a two step, Gallium rich and Nitrogen controlled, growth modes. The method permits a precise, quantitative and direct measurement of the flux of active species as a function of the plasma generation parameters of the cell: nitrogen gas flux and RF-power.</description>

Abstract: Atomically thin crystals hosting flat electronic bands have been recently identified as a rich playground for exploring and engineering strongly correlated phases. Yet, their variety remains limited, primarily to two-dimensional moir\'e superlattices. Here, we predict the formation of reversible, electrically-induced ultra-flat bands and $\pi$-electron magnetism in one-dimensional chevron graphene nanoribbons. Our $ab$ $initio$ calculations show that the application of a transverse electric field to these nanoribbons generates a pair of isolated, nearly perfectly flat bands with widths of approximately 1 meV around the Fermi level. Upon charge doping, these flat bands undergo a Stoner-like electronic instability, resulting in the spontaneous emergence of local magnetic moments at the edges of the otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbon, akin to a one-dimensional spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain. Our findings expand the class of carbon-based nanostructures exhibiting flat bands and establish a novel route for inducing correlated electronic phases in chevron graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Observation of distorted tilted conical phase at the surface of a bulk chiral magnet with resonant elastic x-ray scattering</title>

Abstract: We report on various magnetic configurations including spirals and skyrmions at the surface of the magnetic insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperatures with a magnetic field applied along &lt;100&gt; using resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). We observe a well-ordered surface state referred to as a distorted tilted conical spiral (TC) phase over a wide range of magnetic fields. The distorted TC phase shows characteristic higher harmonic magnetic satellites in the REXS reciprocal space maps. Skyrmions emerge following static magnetic field cycling and appear to coexist with the distorted TC phase. Our results indicate that this phase represents a distinct and stable surface state that does not disappear with field cycling and persists until the field strength is increased sufficiently to create the field-polarized state.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the local electrocaloric effect in 2D ferroelectric In${}_2$Se${}_3$ by Scanning Electrocaloric Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrocaloric effect refers to the temperature change in a material when an electric field is applied or removed. Significant breakthroughs revealed its potential for solid-state cooling technologies in past decades. These devices offer a sustainable alternative to traditional vapor compression refrigeration, with advantages such as compactness, silent operation, and the absence of moving parts or refrigerants.
  Electrocaloric effects are typically studied using indirect methods using polarization data, and which suffer from inaccuracies related to assumptions about heat capacity. Direct methods, although more precise, require device fabrication and face challenges in studying meso- or nanoscale systems, like 2D materials, and materials with non-uniform polarization textures where high spatial resolution is required.
  In this study, a novel technique, Scanning Electrocaloric Thermometry, is introduced for characterizing the local electrocaloric effect in nanomaterials. This approach achieves high spatial resolution by locally applying electric fields and by simultaneously measuring the resulting temperature change. By employing AC excitation, the measurement sensitivity is further enhanced and the electrocaloric effect is disentangled from other heating mechanisms such as Joule heating and dielectric losses. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by examining electrocaloric and heat dissipation phenomena in two-dimensional In${}_2$Se${}_3$ micrometer-sized flakes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study and classify the emergence of protected edge modes at the junction of one-dimensional materials. Using symmetries of Lagrangian planes in boundary symplectic spaces, we present a novel proof of the periodic table of topological insulators in one dimension. We show that edge modes necessarily arise at the junction of two materials having different topological indices. Our approach provides a systematic framework for understanding symmetry-protected modes in one-dimension. It does not rely on periodic nor ergodicity and covers a wide range of operators which includes both continuous and discrete models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural organisms can convert environmental stimuli into sensory feedback to regulate their body and realize active adaptivity. However, realizing such a feedback-regulation mechanism in synthetic material systems remains a grand challenge. It is believed that achieving complex feedback mechanisms in responsive materials will pave the way toward autonomous, intelligent structure and actuation without complex electronics. Inspired by living systems, we report a general principle to design and construct such feedback loops in light-responsive materials. Specifically, we design a baffle-actuator mechanism to incorporate programmed feedback into the opto-mechanical responsiveness. By simply addressing the baffle position with respect to the incident light beam, positive and negative feedback are programmed. We demonstrate the transformation of a light-bending strip into a switcher, where the intensity of light determines the energy barrier under positive feedback, realizing multi-stable shape-morphing. By leveraging the negative feedback and associated homeostasis, we demonstrate two soft robots, i.e., a locomotor and a swimmer. Furthermore, we unveil the ubiquity of feedback in light-responsive materials, which provides new insight into self-regulated robotic matters.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking stochasticity behind reproducibility: denoising strategies in Ta$_2$O$_5$ memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility, endurance, driftless data retention, and fine resolution of the programmable conductance weights are key technological requirements against memristive artificial synapses in neural network applications. However, the inherent fluctuations in the active volume impose severe constraints on the weight resolution. In order to understand and push these limits, a comprehensive noise benchmarking and noise reduction protocol is introduced. Our approach goes beyond the measurement of steady-state readout noise levels and tracks the voltage-dependent noise characteristics all along the resistive switching $I(V)$ curves. Furthermore, we investigate the tunability of the noise level by dedicated voltage cycling schemes in our filamentary Ta$_2$O$_5$ memristors. This analysis highlights a broad, order-of-magnitude variability of the possible noise levels behind seemingly reproducible switching cycles. Our nonlinear noise spectroscopy measurements identify a subthreshold voltage region with voltage-boosted fluctuations. This voltage range enables the reconfiguration of the fluctuators without resistive switching, yielding a highly denoised state within a few subthreshold cycles.</description>

      <title>Local structure and phonon states mediated by intercalation-driven doping in superconducting $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation of two-dimensional (2D) iron chalcogenides with molecular species requires disentangling electronic and structural contributions to understand the puzzling limit to superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) at the frontier of long interlayer separations. Here, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Se K-edge sheds light on the impact of carrier-doping on the local structure of the high-$T_c$ (~39 K) $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ phase. This material is derived by annealing the structurally related as-made derivative ($T_c$~ 44 K), with layers being primed apart by [alkali-molecule] guests. Metrics, such as, a reduced filling of Se $4p$ orbitals and shorter Fe-Se bonds in the annealed phase, corroborate to a lower electron doping level with respect to the as-made one. Analysis of the metal-ligand thermal motion, based on the correlated Debye model, further relates the higher $T_c$ intercalates with the softening of the local Fe-Se bond. Beyond electronic effects, intercalation brings forth host-guest interactions that mediate the dynamics of the bulk crystal structure. For this, neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy on the annealed derivative, corroborates to the Se-Fe-Se layer being sensitive to chemical pressure effects imposed by the confined organic guests. This reflects in the phonon density of states, where harder low-energy transverse acoustic matrix phonons and molecular vibrations are witnessed, with respect to the pristine inorganic ($\beta$-FeSe) and organic ($C_5D_5N$) counterparts. On cooling through $T_c$, these excitations arrive without a collective magnetic-resonance mode - essential in unconventional, spin-mediated mechanisms - enquiring about deviations from optimal doping. The work highlights that when the Fe-square planes are tuned far apart, carrier-doping leveraged by intercalation plays a key role in the $T_c$ parametrization.</description>

Abstract: Skyrmions having topologically protected field configurations with particle-like properties play an important role in {\bl{various fields of science}}. Our present study focus on the generation of skyrmion from spin spiral in the magnetic multilayers of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) with 4d = Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh. Here we investigate the impact of 4d transition metals on the isotropic Heisenberg exchanges and anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions originating from the broken inversion symmetry at the interface of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) multilayers. We find a strong exchange frustration due to the hybridization of the Fe-3d layer with both 4d and Ir-5d layers which modifies due to band filling effects of the 4d transition metals. We strengthen the analysis of exchange frustration by shedding light on the orbital decomposition of isotropic exchange interactions of Fe-3d orbitals. Our spin dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the magnetic ground state of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) transition multilayers is a spin spiral in the $ab$-plane with a period of 1 to 2.5 nm generated by magnetic moments of Fe atoms and propagating along the $a$-direction. The spiral wavelengths in Y/Fe/Ir(111) are much larger compared to Rh/Fe/Ir(111). In order to manipulate the skyrmion phase in 4d/Fe/Ir(111), we investigate the magnetic ground state of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) transition multilayers with different external magnetic field. An increasing external magnetic field of $\sim$ 12 T is responsible for deforming the spin spiral into a isolated skyrmion which flips into skyrmion lattice phase around $\sim$ 18 T in Rh/Fe/Ir(111). Our study predict that the stability of magnetic skyrmion phase in Rh/Fe/Ir(111) against thermal fluctuations is upto temperature T $\leq 90$ K.</description>

Abstract: Environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) enables direct observation of nanoscale chemical processes crucial for catalysis and materials design. However, the high-energy electron probe can dramatically alter reaction pathways through radiolysis - the dissociation of molecules under electron beam irradiation. While extensively studied in liquid-cell TEM, the impact of radiolysis in gas-phase reactions remains unexplored. Here, we present a numerical model elucidating radiation chemistry in both gas and liquid E-TEM environments. Our findings reveal that while gas-phase E-TEM generates radiolytic species with lower reactivity than liquid-phase systems, these species can accumulate to reaction-altering concentrations, particularly at elevated pressures. We validate our model through two case studies: the radiation-promoted oxidation of aluminum nanocubes and disproportionation of carbon monoxide. In both cases, increasing the electron beam dose rate directly accelerates their reaction kinetics, as demonstrated by enhanced AlOx growth and carbon deposition. Based on these insights, we establish practical guidelines for controlling radiolysis in closed-cell nanoreactors. This work not only resolves a fundamental challenge in electron microscopy but also advances our ability to rationally design materials with sub-Angstrom resolution.</description>

Abstract: Predicting spectra and related properties such as the dielectric function of crystalline materials based on machine learning has a huge, hitherto unexplored, technological potential. For this reason, we create an ab initio database of 9915 dielectric tensors of semiconductors and insulators calculated in the independent-particle approximation (IPA). In addition, we present the OptiMate family of machine learning models, a series of graph attention neural networks (GAT) trained to predict the dielectric function and refractive index. OptiMate yields accurate prediction of spectra of semiconductors using only their crystal structure. Smooth, artifact-free curves are obtained without these properties being enforced by penalties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The glassy thermal conductivities observed in crystalline inorganic perovskites such as Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ is perplexing and lacking theoretical explanations. Here, we first experimentally measure such its thermal transport behavior from 20~K to 300~K, after synthesizing Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ single crystals. Using path-integral molecular dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials, we reveal that Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ has large lattice distortions at low temperatures, which may be related to the large atomic size mismatch. Employing the Wigner formulation of thermal transport, we reproduce the experimental thermal conductivities based on lattice-distorted structures. This study thus provides a framework for predicting and understanding glassy thermal transport in materials with strong lattice disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered iron germanium (FeGe) has recently garnered interest as a testbed for a variety of magnetic phenomena as well as for use in magnetic memory and logic applications. This is partially owing to its ability to host skyrmions and antiskyrmions -- nanoscale whirlpools of magnetic moments that could serve as information carriers in spintronic devices. In particular, a tunable skyrmion-antiskyrmion system may be created through precise control of the defect landscape in B20-phase FeGe, motivating developing methods to systematically tune disorder in this material and understand the ensuing structural properties. To this end, we investigate a route for modifying magnetic properties in FeGe. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions, which creates a dispersion of amorphized regions that may preferentially host antiskyrmions at densities controlled by the irradiation fluence. To further tune the disorder landscape, we conduct a systematic electron diffraction study with in-situ annealing, demonstrating the ability to recrystallize controllable fractions of the material at temperatures ranging from approximately 150$^{\circ}$ C to 250$^{\circ}$C. Finally, we describe the crystallization kinetics using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, finding that the growth of crystalline grains is consistent with diffusion-controlled one-to-two dimensional growth with a decreasing nucleation rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a superconducting order featuring spatial pair modulations on the kagome lattice subject to onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor V interactions. Within our functional renormalization group analysis, this state appears with a concomitant d-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum, where it distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the pairing function thus breaking the discrete space group symmetry. The relative weight of the sublattice modulated superconductor (SMS) and d-wave SC is influenced by the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio V /U . Parametrically adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated vestigial charge density wave and an s-wave SC instability. Our study provides a microscopic setting and thorough description of this novel SMS arising within a translation symmetry broken background.</description>

      <title>Van-Hove tuning of Fermi surface instabilities through compensated metallicity</title>

Abstract: Van-Hove (vH) singularities in the vicinity of the Fermi level facilitate the emergence of electronically mediated Fermi surface instabilities. This is because they provide a momentum-localized enhancement of density of states promoting selective electronic scattering channels. High-temperature topological superconductivity has been argued for in graphene at vH filling which, however, has so far proven inaccessible due to the demanded large doping from pristine half filling. We propose compensated metallicity as a path to unlock vH-driven pairing close to half filling in an electronic honeycomb lattice model. Enabled by an emergent multi-pocket fermiology, charge compensation is realized by strong breaking of chiral symmetry from intra-sublattice hybridization, while retaining vH dominated physics at the Fermi level. We conclude by proposing tangible realizations through quantum material design.</description>

      <title>Robust gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect is used to realize topological superconductivity in the topological surface state (TSS) of a 3D topological insulator (TI). In a line Josephson junction made on the TI surface, the spin-momentum locking of the TSS guarantees the existence of a pair of spin-non-degenerate, perfectly transmitted Andreev modes. These modes lead to robust gap closing and parity alteration as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction. Here, we report the observation of the predicted gap closing at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ in a TI Josephson junction ($n$ integer), where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. This phenomenon is robust for a wide range of chemical potentials, supporting its TSS origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our results confirm the fundamental role of spin-momentum locking in the Andreev physics in the TSS, which implies that the observed gap closing and reopening has a topological nature.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>
