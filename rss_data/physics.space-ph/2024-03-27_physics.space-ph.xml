      <title>Global transformer overheating from geomagnetic storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms occurring due to sustained, high-speed solar winds are known to induce currents in power distribution networks. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause high voltage transformers (HVT) to overheat, thus resulting in a catastrophic electricity loss event (CELE). Since significant portions of infrastructures around the world rely heavily on access to electric power, it is essential to estimate the risks associated with GICs on a global scale. We assemble multiple methodologies across various scientific disciplines to develop a framework assessing the probability of a severe geomagnetic storm causing a long-term, widespread power outage. Our model incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage for regions between -70 degrees and 80 degrees geomagnetic latitude due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years) electricity loss.</description>

      <title>Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 2: benchmarking and predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the companion paper ("Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 1: identifying the rate-limiting physics", this issue) an equation was developed for the rate that lunar soil erodes under the exhaust of a landing rocket. That equation has only one parameter that is not calibrated from first principles, so here it is calibrated by the blowing soil's optical density curve during an Apollo landing. An excellent fit is obtained, helping validate the equation. However, when extrapolating the erosion rate all the way to touchdown on the lunar surface, a soil model is needed to handle the increased resistance to erosion as the deeper, more compacted soil is exposed. Relying on models derived from Apollo measurements and from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner thermal inertia measurements, only one additional soil parameter is unknown: the scale of increasing cohesive energy with soil compaction. Treating this as an additional fitting parameter results in some degeneracy in the solutions, but the depth of erosion scour in the post-landing imagery provides an additional constraint on the solution. The results show that about 4 to 10 times more soil was blown in each Apollo landing than previously believed, so the potential for sandblasting damage is worse than prior estimates. This also shows that, with further development, instruments to measure the soil erosion during lunar landings can constrain the soil column's density profile complementary to the thermal inertia measurements, providing insight into the landing site's geology.</description>

      <title>The relative prevalence of wave-packets and coherent structures in the inertial and kinetic ranges of turbulence as seen by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave-packets and (ii) coherent structures (CS). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave-packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar respectively. The probability distributions (pdfs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile-quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations pdfs, revealing three distinct regimes of behaviour. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation pdfs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the pdfs are distinct as the Haar wavelet fluctuations have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR-KR break, the pdf is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing $\sim97\%$ of fluctuations, and tails which are more extended for Haar fluctuations than Db10 fluctuations. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR respectively. The range of scales where the pdfs are $2$-component is narrow at $0.9$ au ($4-16$ s) and broader ($0.5-8$ s) at $0.4$ au. As CS and wave-wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.</description>

      <title>Electron Heating in 2D Particle-in-Cell Simulations of Quasi-Perpendicular Low-Beta Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the thermal electron energization in 1D and 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular, low-beta ($\beta_p=0.25$) collisionless ion-electron shocks with mass ratio $m_i/m_e=200$, fast Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{ms}=1$-$4$, and upstream magnetic field angle $\theta_{Bn} = 55$-$85^\circ$ from shock normal $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$. It is known that shock electron heating is described by an ambipolar, $\boldsymbol{B}$-parallel electric potential jump, $\Delta\phi_\parallel$, that scales roughly linearly with the electron temperature jump. Our simulations have $\Delta\phi_\parallel/(0.5 m_i {u_\mathrm{sh}}^2) \sim 0.1$-$0.2$ in units of the pre-shock ions' bulk kinetic energy, in agreement with prior measurements and simulations. Different ways to measure $\phi_\parallel$, including the use of de Hoffmann-Teller frame fields, agree to tens-of-percent accuracy. Neglecting off-diagonal electron pressure tensor terms can lead to a systematic underestimate of $\phi_\parallel$ in our low-$\beta_p$ shocks. We further focus on two $\theta_{Bn}=65^\circ$ shocks: a $\mathcal{M}_s=4$ ($\mathcal{M}_A=1.8$) case with a long, $30 d_i$ precursor of whistler waves along $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$, and a $\mathcal{M}_s=7$ ($\mathcal{M}_A=3.2$) case with a shorter, $5d_i$ precursor of whistlers oblique to both $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$; $d_i$ is the ion skin depth. Within the precursors, $\phi_\parallel$ has a secular rise towards the shock along multiple whistler wavelengths and also has localized spikes within magnetic troughs. In a 1D simulation of the $\mathcal{M}_s=4$, $\theta_{Bn}=65^\circ$ case, $\phi_\parallel$ shows a weak dependence on the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, and $\phi_\parallel$ decreases by a factor of 2 as $m_i/m_e$ is raised to the true proton-electron value of 1836.</description>

      <title>A Method for Determining the Locations and Configurations of Magnetic Reconnection within 3D Turbulent Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Three-dimensional (3D) reconnection is an important mechanism for efficiently releasing energy during astrophysical eruptive events, which is difficult to be quantitatively analyzed especially within turbulent plasmas.
  Aims. In this paper, an efficient method for identifying locations and configurations of 3D reconnection from MHD data is developed.
  Methods. This method analyzes the local nonideal electric field and magnetic structure at an arbitrary position. As only performing algebraical manipulations on the discrete field data and avoiding computationally expensive operations like field-line tracing and root-finding, this method naturally possesses high efficiency. To validate this method, we apply it to the 3D data from a high-resolution simulation of a Harris-sheet reconnection and a data-driven simulation of a coronal flux rope eruption.
  Results. It is shown that this method can precisely identify the local structures of discrete magnetic field. Through the information of nonideal electric field and the geometric attributes of magnetic field, the local structures of reconnection sites can be effectively and comprehensively determined. For fine turbulent processes, both qualitative pictures and quantitative statistical properties of small-scale reconnection structures can be obtained. For large-scale solar simulations, macro-scale magnetic structures such as flux ropes and eruption current sheets can also be recognized.
  Conclusions. We develop a powerful method to analyze multi-scale structures of 3D reconnection. It can be applied not only in MHD simulations but also in kinetic simulations, plasma experiments, and in-situ observations.</description>
