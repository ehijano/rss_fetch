      <title>Anomalous diffusion in multichannel systems without a L\'evy distribution of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that multichannel quantum systems with uncorrelated but asymmetric Anderson-type disorder can exhibit anomalous diffusion, even in the absence of heavy-tailed disorder. Using a minimal two-channel model with channel asymmetry, we demonstrate a crossover from normal to anomalous transport tuned by interchannel coupling. Applied to quasi-one-dimensional lattices with edge disorder, this leads to long-tailed transmission statistics characterized by ballistic segments interspersed with localized ones, reminiscent of L\'evy flights. This channel-asymmetric anomalous diffusion (CAAD) emerges from quantum interference between channels with differing disorder strengths. While CAAD governs transport at intermediate lengths, conventional localization prevails asymptotically, violating the Thouless relation. These results highlight a distinct quantum mechanism for anomalous diffusion beyond classical paradigms.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Switching of Magnetism via Gate-Induced Sliding in Tetralayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer sliding degrees of freedom often determine the physical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. In graphene, for instance, the metastable rhombohedral stacking arrangement hosts correlated and topological electronic phases, which are absent in conventional Bernal stacking. Here, we demonstrate a sliding-induced first-order structural phase transition between Bernal and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene driven by gate voltages. Through transport measurement, we observe bistable switching between a Bernal-dominant state and a rhombohedral-Bernal mixed state across a wide space of the gate-voltage phase diagram. The structural phase transition results in nonvolatile switching between a paramagnet and a ferromagnet accompanied by the anomalous Hall effect. The sign reversal of the anomalous Hall effect under opposite displacement fields suggests that it may originate from domain boundaries between the Bernal and rhombohedral regions. Our discovery paves the way for on-demand toggling of quantum phases based on the sliding phase transition of 2D materials and offers a playground to explore unconventional physics at the stacking domain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Josephson parametric amplifiers based on semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid materials have been extensively used for experiments on electrically tunable quantum devices. Notably, Josephson junctions utilizing nanowire weak links have enabled a number of new gate-tunable qubits, including gatemons, Andreev level qubits and spin qubits. Conversely, superconducting parametric amplifiers based on Josephson junctions have not yet been implemented using nanowires, even though such nearly quantum limited amplifiers are key elements in experiments on quantum circuits. Here we present Josephson parametric amplifiers based on arrays of parallel InAs nanowires that feature a large critical current as required for linear amplification. The resonance frequency of the devices is gate-tunable by almost 1 GHz, with a gain exceeding 20 dB in multiple frequencies and noise approaching the quantum-limit. This new platform enables on-chip integration of gate-tunable qubits with quantum limited amplifiers using the same hybrid materials and on any substrate.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Response Functions of Graphene: Impact on Casimir and Casimi-Polder Forces in and out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review and obtain some new results on the temperature dependence of spatially nonlocal response functions of graphene and their applications to calculation of both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces. After a brief summary of the properties of the polarization tensor of graphene obtained within Dirac model in the framework of quantum field theory, we derive the expressions for the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions. The behavior of these functions at different temperatures is investigated in the regions below and above the threshold. Special attention is paid to the double pole at zero frequency which is present in the transverse response function of graphene. An application of the response functions of graphene to calculation of the equilibrium Casimir force between two graphene sheets and Casimir-Polder forces between an atom (nanoparticle) and a graphene sheet is considered with due attention to the role of a nonzero energy gap, chemical potential and a material substrate underlying the graphene sheet. The same subject is discussed for out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces. The role of the obtained and presented results for fundamental science and nanotechnology is outlined.</description>

      <title>Charge and Valley Hydrodynamics in the Quantum Hall Regime of Gapped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified viscous hydrodynamics for charge and valley transport in gapped graphene in the quantum Hall regime. We redefine Hall viscosity as a response to static electric-field gradients instead of strain, establishing a derivative hierarchy that fundamentally links it to nonlocal Hall conductivity. The theory predicts quantized Hall viscosity for charge and valley, including a ground-state contribution. Crucially, the valley current is unaffected by the Lorentz force and is directly accessible via the local pressure, namely the electrostatic potential that tracks fluid vorticity.</description>

      <title>Fast and Sensitive Readout of a Semiconductor Quantum Dot Using an In-Situ Microwave Resonator with Enhanced Gate Lever Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot (DQD) directly coupled to a niobium superconducting coplanar stripline (CPS) microwave resonator. This hybrid architecture enables high-bandwidth dispersive readout suitable for real-time feedback and error-correction protocols. Fast and sensitive readout is achieved primarily by optimizing the DQD gate lever arm, guided by MaSQE quantum dot simulations, which enhances the dispersive signal without requiring high-impedance resonators. We demonstrate a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of unity with an integration time of 34.54 nanoseconds, corresponding to a system bandwidth of 14.48 MHz and a charge sensitivity of 0.000186 e per square root hertz. Analysis of the voltage power spectral density (PSD) of the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) baseband signals characterizes the system's readout noise, with the PSD's dependence on integration time providing insight into distinct physical regimes.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1\text{g}}$ Raman Mode in MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When combined into van der Waals heterostructures, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers enable the exploration of novel physics beyond their unique individual properties. However, for interesting phenomena such as interlayer charge transfer and interlayer excitons to occur, precise control of the interface and ensuring high-quality interlayer contact is crucial. Here, we investigate bilayer heterostructures fabricated by combining chemical-vapor-deposition-grown MoS$_2$ and exfoliated WS$_2$ monolayers, allowing us to form several heterostructures with various twist angles within one preparation step. In case of sufficiently good interfacial contact, evaluated by photoluminescence quenching, we observe a twist-angle-dependent enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ Raman mode. In contrast, other WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ Raman modes (in particular, the MoS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode) do not show a clear enhancement under the same experimental conditions. We present a systematic study of this mode-selective effect using nonresonant Raman measurements that are complemented with ab-initio calculations of Raman spectra. We find that the selective enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode exhibits a strong dependence on interlayer distance. We show that this selectivity is related to the A$_{1g}$ eigenvectors in the heterolayer: the eigenvectors are predominantly localized on one of the two layers; yet, the intensity of the MoS$_2$ mode is attenuated because the WS$_2$ layer is vibrating (albeit with much lower amplitude) out of phase, while the WS$_2$ mode is amplified because the atoms on the MoS$_2$ layer are vibrating in phase. To separate this eigenmode effect from resonant Raman enhancement, our study is extended with near-resonant Raman measurements.</description>

      <title>On the mechanism of ferromagnetic resonance in ferromagnet-superconductor trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature dependent magnetic properties of superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SC/FM/SC) trilayers are studied both experimentally and theoretically, with a focus on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The influence of the SC and FM layer thicknesses on the FMR field is examined. To differentiate the mechanisms involved, we additionally investigate structures containing nonmagnetic metallic (M) or insulating (I) spacers (SC/FM/M/SC or SC/FM/I/SC). All the studied multilayers show large reductions in the FMR field below the critical temperature of the SC, except the system containing an insulating spacer (SC/FM/I/SC). This SC-induced FMR-shift (resonance field/frequency) is larger for thicker SC as well as FM layers, reaching a saturation value for very large thicknesses. To explain the measured results, an analytical model is developed, in which the FM-magnetization precession modulates the magnetic flux in the system, thereby inducing an alternating supercurrent in the SC, which in turn produces a dynamic back-action magnetic field on the FM that shifts its resonance frequency. The model considers closed current loops, where the FM layer conductively links the supercurrents flowing in the opposite directions in the two outer SC layers. Our results provide a practical route for increasing the operating frequency of magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Skin Effect and Electronic Nonlocal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems governed by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians exhibit unique phenomena, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenstates localize at system boundaries. We investigate this effect in a Rashba nanowire coupled to a ferromagnetic lead and demonstrate that it can be detected via non-local transport spectroscopy: while local conductance remains symmetric, the non-local conductance becomes non-reciprocal. We account for this behavior using both conventional transport arguments and the framework of non-Hermitian physics. Furthermore, we explain that exceptional points shift in parameter space when transitioning from periodic to open boundary conditions, a phenomenon observed in other non-Hermitian systems but so far not explained. Our results establish transport spectroscopy as a tool to probe non-Hermitian effects in open electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic linear magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetal NiTe2 nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the magneto-transport properties of exfoliated NiTe2 nano-flakes with varying thicknesses and disorder levels, unveiling two distinct physical mechanisms governing the observed anisotropic linear magnetoresistance (MR). For the perpendicular magnetic field configuration, the well-defined linear MR in high fields is unambiguously attributed to a classical origin. This conclusion is supported by the proportionality between the MR slope and the carrier mobility, and between the crossover field and the inverse of mobility. In stark contrast, the linear MR under parallel magnetic fields exhibits a non-classical character. It shows a pronounced enhancement with decreasing flake thickness, which correlates with an increasing hole-to-electron concentration ratio. This distinctive thickness dependence suggests an origin in the nonlinear band effects near the Dirac point, likely driven by the shift of the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strengthening of MR anisotropic with enhanced inter-layer transport contradicts the prediction of the guiding-center diffusion model for three-dimensional systems. Our findings highlight the critical roles of band topology and structural dimensional in the anomalous magneto-transport of Dirac semi-metals.</description>

      <title>Temperature anomaly of the V$_Si$ and V$_C$ vacancy spin coherence time in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the spin coherence time (T2) is a major area of interest for spin defect systems such as the silicon (V$_Si$) and carbon (V$^\pm _C$) vacancies in 4H-SiC. Usually as temperature increases, T2 decreases due to the thermal bath. Observations of electron-paramagnetic resonance and direct systematic measurements of T2 has seen an anomaly where T2 increases with increasing temperature. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that cause the T2 temperature anomaly. We find that due to a spontaneous symmetry lowering from a motional Jahn-Teller distortion, a polaron quasi-particle is generated from the vibronic coupling. Initially, for temperatures from 8 to 20 - 40K, the coherence temperature dependence is dominated by phonon-assisted spin relaxation. At temperatures around 20 - 40K, depending on the vacancy, a thermally activated polaron hopping turns on and motional narrowing dominates and increases T2 with increasing temperature. As temperatures reach 120 - 160K, the energy barrier gets high enough to slow the polaron hopping. At this point the Larmor precession dominates, leading to decoherence. Our calculated temperature-dependent coherence agrees with what has been seen experimentally, giving a full theoretical framework for the mechanisms that cause the T2 temperature anomaly of increasing T2 with increasing temperature. The theoretical framework presented here also gives insight into these mechanisms being a probable universal phenomenon that could occur in many other defect center spin systems.</description>

      <title>Wave Packet Propagation through Graphene with Square and Triangular Patterned Circular Potential Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, using the Dirac continuum model combined with the split-operator technique, we investigate the propagation dynamics of wave packets in graphene in the presence of circular potential barriers arranged in square and triangular geometries. Our results reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the wave packet transmission on the number of barrier rows along the propagation direction: the transmission initially decreases as rows of barriers are removed, but then increases again when additional rows are eliminated. To explain the observed nonlinear behavior, the time evolution of the transmission probability is analyzed, providing insight into the interplay between wave packet dynamics and the spatial arrangement of potential barriers. These findings offer a pathway for designing graphene-based devices with tunable transport properties through engineered potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Dynamics in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically doped topological insulators (TIs) exhibit two distinct phases: the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase when the Fermi level resides within the surface gap, and a metallic phase outside the gap. The QAH phase hosts unidirectional transport channels known as chiral edge states, while the metallic phase exhibits non-reciprocal transport due to unbalanced bidirectional edge states. Utilizing the chiral edge states in Cr-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3 sandwich structures, we realize non-Hermitian conductance matrices in a one-dimensional Corbino chain with well-defined chirality. By tuning the boundary conditions from open to periodic, we reveal the non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenstates localize exponentially at one end of the chain. In the metallic phase, we further observe asymmetric, bidirectional coupling between the neighboring sites in the conductance matrix, a direct consequence of the system's intrinsic non-reciprocity. These results establish magnetic TIs as a powerful platform for investigating emergent non-Hermitian phenomena in topological systems.</description>

Abstract: Colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots (QD) enable the bottom-up assembly of designer solids. Among the multitudinous applications of QD solids, there has been great success in exploiting the tunable optical properties for LED displays, lighting, bioimaging and diagnostics. Applications dependent on electrical properties such as solar cells, photodetectors, and transistors have fallen short of their full potential because of poor control over electrical properties, and some of applications with the most promise for novelty, such as a solid-state quantum simulator for quantum computation and spintronics, are stagnant. Lack of clarity on the charge transport mechanism has been a significant barrier to progress, particularly as numerous sources of disorder are present. In this work, we make advancements in a nano-patterning technique to fabricate a 70-nm wide QD solid that is also free of several sources of structural defects. Owing to the small size and structural integrity, we isolate the charge dynamics of a single conductance channel within a percolation network. We tune parameters to measure ~10 channels, and with a time-resolved measurement, we find conductance noise that exceeds 100% of the average current. From observation of the long-time dynamics of the charge transport, including random telegraph noise, colored noise and attractor states, we model the transport with stochastic quasi-one-dimensional percolation paths. With this insight into the charge transport of QD solids unimpeded by structural defects, we provide a path for the rational design of a QD solid with electrical properties that reflect the underlying tunable, periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>

      <title>Atomic networks as highways for holes in oxygen-deficient amorphous oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxygen-deficient amorphous tellurium oxides ($a$-TeO$_x$) have recently challenged the intrinsic hole mobility limits of amorphous oxides, with thin-film transistors reaching mobilities up to 15 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ upon Se doping. However, the atomistic origins of this behavior, and its seeming contradiction with established semiconductor physics, have remained unresolved. Here, we combine machine-learning-accelerated ab initio molecular dynamics with hybrid-functional defect calculations to establish a new microscopic picture. We show that substantial oxygen loss drives spontaneous segregation into interpenetrating $a$-Te and $a$-TeO$_2$ domains, rather than forming dispersed oxygen vacancies. The diffuse Te-$5p$ states from the $a$-Te network supply percolative pathways for holes, so mobility rises monotonically with oxygen deficiency, enabling mobilities that exceed current records. Doped Se incorporates into the $a$-Te domain, enhancing the connectivity of conductive pathways, thereby increasing hole mobility. Similar behavior in amorphous SeO$_x$ suggests domain percolation as a general route to high-mobility p-type transport in amorphous oxides.</description>

      <title>An InAsSb surface quantum well with in-situ deposited Nb as a platform for semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel semiconductor-superconductor hybrid material based on a molecular beam epitaxially grown InAsSb surface quantum well with an in-situ deposited Nb top layer. Relative to conventional Al-InAs based systems, the InAsSb surface quantum well offers a lower effective mass and stronger spin-orbit interaction, while the Nb layer has a higher critical temperature and a larger critical magnetic field. The in-situ deposition of the Nb results in a high-quality interface that enables strong coupling to the InAsSb quantum well. Transport measurements on Josephson junctions reveal an induced superconducting gap of 1.3 meV. Furthermore, a planar asymmetric SQUID is realized, exhibiting gate-tunable superimposed oscillations originating from both the individual Josephson junction and the full SQUID loop. The large induced superconducting gap combined with strong spin-orbit interaction position this material as an attractive platform for experiments exploring gate-tunable superconductivity and topological superconducting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subject of this study is spin transport through a molecular orbital connected to two leads, and coupled via exchange interaction with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin in a constant magnetic field. The inelastic spin-flip processes between molecular quasienergy levels are driven by the molecular spin precession. By setting the Larmor frequency, the tilt angle of molecular magnetization with respect to the magnetic field, and the magnetic anisotropy parameter, one can modulate the spin current and noise, spin-transfer torque, and related torque coefficients. Moreover, the dc-spin current and spin-transfer torque components provide the quasienergy level structure in the orbital. Quantum interference effects between states connected with spin-flip processes manifest themselves as dips (minimums) and peaks (maximums) in spin-current noise, matching Fano-like resonance profiles with equal probabilities of interfering elastic and inelastic spin-flip pathways. By proper adjustment of the anisotropy parameter and magnetic field, the precession is suppressed and the torque vanishes, revealing the anisotropy parameter via a dc-spin current or torque measurement. The results of the study show that spin transport and spin-transfer torque can be manipulated by the anisotropy parameter even in the absence of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Resonance Spectroscopy: Characterizing Fast Dynamics with Slow Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system's internal dynamics and its interaction with the environment can be determined by tracking how external perturbations affect its transition rates between states. Quantitative measurements of these rates are crucial for optimizing quantum systems at the atomic scale but are challenging, as these dynamics are often faster than experimental observation capabilities. Here, we show that driving a stochastic system periodically enables quantitative determination of its transition rates over a wide frequency range spanning from kilohertz to gigahertz. To perform this quantitative extraction, we provide an analytical model that is applicable irrespective of the details of the studied system. We name this method stochastic resonance spectroscopy (SRS). We apply it to quantify spin switching in individual magnetic atoms, Neel state reversal in nano-antiferromagnets and quasiparticle transport through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. We anticipate that the ability to characterize broadband stochastic dynamics at the atomic scale will enable insights into an even wider range of systems, e.g. dynamics driven by light-matter interaction. Another exciting prospect is the investigation of systems that exhibit non-Markovian dynamics due to correlations with the environment.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven resonant soft-X-ray scattering for probing picosecond dynamics of nanometre-scale order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray scattering has been an indispensable tool in advancing our understanding of matter, from the first evidence of the crystal lattice to recent discoveries of nuclei's fastest dynamics. In addition to the lattice, ultrafast resonant elastic scattering of soft X-rays provides a sensitive probe of charge, spin, and orbital order with unparalleled nanometre spatial and femto- to picosecond temporal resolution. However, the full potential of this technique remains largely unexploited due to its high demand on the X-ray source. Only a selected number of instruments at large-scale facilities can deliver the required short-pulsed and wavelength-tunable radiation, rendering laboratory-scale experiments elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved X-ray scattering with spectroscopic contrast at a laboratory-based instrument using the soft-X-ray radiation emitted from a laser-driven plasma source. Specifically, we investigate the photo-induced response of magnetic domains emerging in a ferrimagnetic heterostructure with 9$\,$ps temporal resolution. The achieved sensitivity allows for tracking the reorganisation of the domain network on pico- to nanosecond time scales in great detail. This instrumental development and experimental demonstration break new ground for studying material dynamics in a wide range of laterally ordered systems in a flexible laboratory environment.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall magnetoresistance at the altermagnetic insulator/Pt interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resistance of a heavy metal can be modulated by an adjacent magnetic material through the combined effects of the spin Hall effect, inverse spin Hall effect, and dissipation of the spin accumulation at the interface. This phenomenon is known as the spin Hall magnetoresistance. The dissipation of the spin accumulation can occur via various mechanisms, with spin-transfer torque being the most extensively studied. In this work, we report the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance at the interface between platinum and an insulating altermagnetic candidate, Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$. Our findings reveal that this heterostructure exhibits a relatively large spin Hall magnetoresistance signal, which is anisotropic with respect to the crystal orientation of the current channel. We explore and rule out several potential explanations for this anisotropy and propose that our results may be understood in the context of the anisotropies of the spin current channels across the Pt/altermagnetic Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$ interface.</description>

Abstract: Molecular electronics and other technologies whose components comprise individual molecules have been pursued for half a century because the molecular scale represents the limit of miniaturisation of objects whose structure is tuneable for function. Despite the promise, practical progress has been hindered by the lack of methodologies for directed assembly of arbitrary structures applicable at the molecular scale. DNA nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale.
  Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high success rate and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and adaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular components, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of classical and quantum molecular technologies.</description>

      <title>Tracking the photoinduced dynamics of a dark excitonic state in single-layer WS$_2$ via resonant Autler-Townes splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (1L-TMD) are highly bound states characterized by a Rydberg-like spectrum of discrete energy levels. Among these, states with odd-parity are known as dark excitons due to selection rules, which make their stationary and transient characterization challenging using linear optical techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of a 2p dark excitonic state in 1L-WS$_2$ can be directly retrieved by measuring the Autler-Townes splitting of bright states in a three-pulse experiment. The splitting of the bright 1s excitonic state, observed by detuning a mid-infrared control field across the 1s-2p transition, provides an accurate characterization of the 2p state. Following carrier photoinjection, we observe a qualitatively different dynamics of the 1s and 2p levels, which is indicative of symmetry-dependent screening and exciton-exciton interactions. These findings provide new insights into many-body effects in TMDs, offering potential avenues for advancing the next generation optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that zero-dimensional (0-D) systems can host non-trivial topology analogous to macroscopic topological materials in greater dimensions. Unlike macroscopic periodic systems with translational symmetry, zero-dimensional materials such as molecules, clusters and quantum dots can exhibit discrete rotation symmetry. The eigenstates can thus be grouped into discrete bands and Bloch-like wave functions. Since the symmetry is discrete, the Berry phase and the topological indices must be defined by discrete Wilson polygons. Here, we demonstrate non-trivial Z2 orders in two representative 0-D molecules, [m]-Cycloparaphenylene and [m]-iso-thianaphthene, where topological transitions occur when modifying the coupling between the repeating units. Similar to macroscopic topological systems in greater dimensions, localized boundary states emerge in composite nanohoops formed by segments that are topologically distinct. This opens up the possibility of non-trivial topological phases in 0-D systems.</description>

Abstract: A significant effort in condensed matter physics is dedicated to the search for exotic arrangements of electric dipoles in crystals. Non-collinear dipolar arrangements mimicking magnetic spin textures, such as polar vortices and skyrmions, have been realized, but others, like helices of dipoles, have remained elusive. While earlier work claimed the presence of a helical dipole modulation in ferroelectric BiCu$_{x}$Mn$_{7-x}$O$_{12}$, our results rule out such a structure, motivating a renewed search for helical textures. Using atomic-resolution imaging, we report a novel form of helical order in which polar domains self-organize into a mesoscopic helical pattern: from domain to domain, polarization rotation follows a consistent handedness. Both right- and left-handed chirality emerging from this helical ordering are observed. This discovery establishes mesoscopic ordering as novel mechanism for inducing helical textures, and hence chirality, in ferroelectric crystals, paralleling the efforts in liquid crystals and supramolecular assemblies.</description>

Abstract: The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Hall edge channels partition electric charge over N chiral (uni-directional) modes. Intermode scattering leads to partition noise, observed in graphene p-n junctions. While inelastic scattering suppresses this noise by averaging out fluctuations, we show that pure (quasi-elastic) dephasing may enhance the partition noise. The noise power increases by up to 50% for two modes, with a general enhancement factor of 1+1/N in the strong-dephasing limit. This counterintuitive effect is explained in the framework of monitored quantum transport, arising from the self-averaging of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (\mbox{S-TMDs}) emit light very efficiently and display rich spin-valley physics, with gyromagnetic ($g$-) factors of about -4. Here, we investigate how these properties can be tailored by alloying. Magneto-optical spectroscopy is used to reveal the peculiar properties of excitonic complexes in Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ MLs with different Mo and W concentrations. We show that the alloys feature extremely high $g$-factors for neutral excitons, that change gradually with the composition up to reaching values of the order of -10 for $x \approx 0.2$. First-principles calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide evidence that alloying in S-TMDs results in a non-trivial band structure engineering, being at the origin of the high $g$-factors. The theoretical framework also suggests a higher strain sensitivity of the alloys, making them promising candidates for tailor-made optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Two-level Systems directly after Cryogenic Alternating Bias</title>

Abstract: Two-level systems (TLSs) are tunneling states commonly found in amorphous materials that electrically couple to qubits, resonators, and vibrational modes in materials, leading to energy loss in those systems. Recent studies suggest that applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure, potentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study, we probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS dynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the strongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric field. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their densities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the steady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating bias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency fluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these effects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a reversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC oscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the alternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state spectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide film introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence. Understanding this non-equilibrium energy could inform future models of time-dependent TLS dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic pressure sensing with an ultrafast Meissner-levitated microrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.</description>
