      <title>Modulated deuteron spectra observed with the Magnetic Recoil neutron Spectrometer at the National Ignition Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magnetic Recoil Spectrometer (MRS) on the National Ignition Facility is used to measure the neutron spectrum from deuterium-tritium fueled inertial confinement fusion implosions via n-d elastic scattering and magnetic dispersion of recoil deuterons. From the MRS-determined neutron spectrum, the yield ($Y_n$), apparent ion temperature ($T_i$) and areal density ($\rho R$) are determined. However, anomalous energy modulations in recoil deuterons have been observed in several high-yield indirect drive experiments ($Y_n\sim10^{16}-10^{18}$). These observations raise concerns about their potential impact on the MRS-inferred performance metrics. Analytic calculations and particle-in-cell simulations are used to examine the possible beam-plasma instabilities, which indicate the two-stream instability as the driving mechanism behind energy modulations. Based on a statistical analysis of synthetic deuteron spectra, the modulations-induced errors are found to be within the errors of the determined $Y_n$, $T_i$ and $\rho R$ values and thus do not have a significant impact on the MRS measurement.</description>

      <title>TGLF-SINN: Deep Learning Surrogate Model for Accelerating Turbulent Transport Modeling in Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) model provides fast, accurate predictions of turbulent transport in tokamaks, but whole device simulations requiring thousands of evaluations remain computationally expensive. Neural network (NN) surrogates offer accelerated inference with fully differentiable approximations that enable gradient-based coupling but typically require large training datasets to capture transport flux variations across plasma conditions, creating significant training burden and limiting applicability to expensive gyrokinetic simulations. We propose \textbf{TGLF-SINN (Spectra-Informed Neural Network)} with three key innovations: (1) principled feature engineering that reduces target prediction range, simplifying the learning task; (2) physics-guided regularization of transport spectra to improve generalization under sparse data; and (3) Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) to strategically select training samples based on model uncertainty, reducing data requirements while maintaining accuracy. Our approach achieves superior performance with significantly less training data. In offline settings, TGLF-SINN reduces logarithmic root mean squared error (LRMSE) by 12. 4\% compared to the current baseline \base. Using only 25\% of the complete dataset with BAL, we achieve LRMSE only 0.0165 higher than \base~and 0.0248 higher than our offline model (0.0583). In downstream flux matching applications, our NN surrogate provides 45x speedup over TGLF while maintaining comparable accuracy, demonstrating potential for training efficient surrogates for higher-fidelity models where data acquisition is costly and sparse.</description>

      <title>Measurement of ion acceleration and diffusion in a laser-driven magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present results from an experiment performed at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research. A mono-energetic beam of chromium ions with initial energies of $\sim 450$ MeV was fired through a magnetized interaction region formed by the collision of two counter-propagating laser-ablated plasma jets. While laser interferometry revealed the absence of strong fluid-scale turbulence, acceleration and diffusion of the beam ions was driven by wave-particle interactions. A possible mechanism is particle acceleration by electrostatic, short scale length kinetic turbulence, such as the lower-hybrid drift instability.</description>

      <title>Unifying Kappa Distribution Models for Non-Equilibrium Space Plasmas: A Superstatistical Approach Based on Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, modeling the velocity distribution of particles in non-equilibrium, steady-state plasmas presents a significant challenge. Under this context, a family of kappa distributions has been widely used to capture the high-energy tails in space plasmas. These distributions deviate from the canonical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and vary significantly in their interpretation of the temperature of an out-of-equilibrium system. In this letter, we establish the validity of any kappa distribution from the standpoint of superstatistics. This study unifies these models by introducing a new kappa distribution based on superstatistical parameters, providing a more general and fundamental framework to connect these distributions and the superstatistical temperature of a system. We demonstrate that the general distribution depends on the thermal characteristics of the modeled temperature distribution population. Furthermore, we present a moment-based velocity distribution that bypasses the traditional temperature debate, relying on the velocity moments. Our findings enhance the understanding of kappa distributions and offer a robust model for non-equilibrium space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays on Galaxy Scales: Progress and Pitfalls for CR-MHD Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (&lt; au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Imaging and Radio Signatures of Shock-Plasmoid Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how shocks interact with coronal structures is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Using simultaneous radio and white-light observations, we investigate the interaction between a CME-driven shock and a plasmoid. LASCO and STEREO-A COR-2 white-light images are analyzed to track the evolution of the plasmoid, CME and its associated shock, while the Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES dynamic spectra provide complementary radio signatures of the shock-plasmoid interaction at $\approx$7 R$_\odot$. An interplanetary Type II radio burst was detected as the shock propagated through the plasmoid. The merging of the plasmoid into the CME was accompanied by interplanetary Type III radio bursts, suggesting escaping electron beams during the reconnection process. These observations clearly demonstrate that shock-plasmoid interactions can enhance the efficiency of particle acceleration associated with CMEs, with implications for electron acceleration in flare and heliospheric current sheets as well.</description>

      <title>Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a reconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed distributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in fully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic parameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the need for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the observed particle energization more accurately.</description>

      <title>Augmented Lagrangian methods produce cutting-edge magnetic coils for stellarator fusion reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding feasible coils for stellarator fusion devices is a critical challenge of realizing this concept for future power plants. Current design efforts struggle to navigate the highly nonconvex optimization landscape, spend considerable resources scanning the parameter space, and may produce suboptimal coils. In this work, we present an augmented Lagrangian approach to tackle the ill-posed problem of coil optimization. We illustrate its effectiveness and versatility by generating coils for five stellarators with very different symmetries and magnetic field shaping. In all cases, we find Pareto-optimal coil solutions that in various ways outperform published coil sets.</description>

      <title>Complete reflection of nonlinear electromagnetic waves in underdense pair plasmas enabled by dynamically formed Bragg-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using kinetic simulations and theory, we show that nonlinear electromagnetic waves can make even strongly underdense pair plasmas fully reflective. As the wave compresses and accelerates the plasma, weak reflection seeds a periodic train of density spikes that grow rapidly due to mass symmetry. This moving Bragg-like grating increases reflection and momentum transfer, enabling a transition to a regime where the relativistic plasma-vacuum interface sustains complete reflection. Finite temperature raises the full-reflection density threshold, yet the corresponding density can remain underdense.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric and ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.</description>

      <title>Performance envelope of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser wakefield accelerator experiments have made enormous progress over the past $\sim 20$ years, but their promise to revolutionize high-energy particle sources is only beginning to be realized. To make the next step toward engineering LWFAs for different accelerator outcomes, we need more reliable and quantitative models to predict performance. Using the data from $&gt;50$ published experiments, we estimate scalings and the performance envelope. We compare the observed scalings with several models in the literature. We find that the total beam energy (centroid energy times beam charge) scales almost linearly with laser energy, supporting the value of investment in progressively higher energy driver lasers. The dataset includes pulse durations from 8 to 160 fs, but only laser wavelengths of 800 nm and 1 \si{\micro\meter}, meaning we could not check proposed wavelength scalings for alternative laser technologies. As a benchmark next-generation case, the observed scalings suggest that achieving a 100-GeV LWFA stage will require a $\gtrsim 30$ PW laser operating at electron density $&lt;10^{17}/$cm$^3$.</description>

      <title>Subspace Approximation to the Focused Transport Equation. II. The Modified Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles in a spatially varying magnetic field is described by the focused transport equation. In the past two versions of this equation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a pitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the current paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form also called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the norm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously developed subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically and numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional subspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for which one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically. This type of semi-numerical approach is much faster than traditional solvers and, therefore, it is very useful.</description>
