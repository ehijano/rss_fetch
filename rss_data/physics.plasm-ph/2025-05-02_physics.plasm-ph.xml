      <title>Path to a Single-Stage, 100-GeV Electron Beam via a Flying-Focus-Driven Laser-Plasma Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dephasingless laser wakefield acceleration (DLWFA), a novel laser wakefield acceleration concept based on the recently demonstrated "flying focus" technology, offers a new paradigm in laser-plasma acceleration that could advance the progress toward a TeV linear accelerator using a single-stage system without guiding structures. The recently proposed NSF OPAL laser facility could be the transformative technology that enables this grand challenge in laser-plasma acceleration. We review the viable parameter space for DLWFA based on the scaling of its performance with laser and plasma parameters, and we compare that performance to traditional laser wakefield acceleration. These scalings indicate the necessity for ultrashort, high-energy laser architectures such as NSF OPAL to achieve groundbreaking electron energies using DLWFA. Initial results from MTW-OPAL, the platform for the 6-J DLWFA demonstration experiment, show a tight, round focal spot over a distance of 3.7 mm. New particle-in-cell simulations of that platform indicate that using hydrogen for DLWFA reduces the amount of laser light that is distorted due to refraction at ionization fronts. An experimental path, and the computational and technical design work along that path, from the current status of the field to a single-stage, 100-GeV electron beam via DLWFA on NSF OPAL is outlined. Progress along that path is presented.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>Construction and analysis of guiding center distributions for tokamak plasmas with ambient radial electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contribution of a time-independent toroidally-symmetric radial electric field $E_r$ is implemented in VisualStart [Comp. Phys. Comm. 275 (2022) 108305; arXiv:2111.08224], a code whose purposes include the construction of guiding center (GC) drift orbit databases for the study of plasma instabilities in tokamaks. $E_r$ is important for the thermal part of the velocity distribution and for fast particle resonances in the kHz frequency range. KSTAR, JT-60U and ITER tokamak cases are used as working examples to test our methods and discuss practical issues connected with $E_r$. Two points are worth noting: First, the GC orbit space is sampled in the magnetic midplane as before, and we find that in the presence of $E_r$, midplane-based coordinates are not only equivalent but superior to conventional constants of motion, allowing to attain high numerical accuracy and efficiency with a relatively simple mesh. Second, the periodic parallel acceleration and deceleration of GCs via the mirror force is modulated by $E_r$. Although this parallel electric acceleration averages to zero during a poloidal transit (or bounce) period, it has important consequences, one being the known shift of the trapped-passing boundary. Another consequence is that electric frequency shifts depend on the chosen reference point, so that some care is required when evaluating the $E_r$-dependence of transit frequencies for resonance analyses.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational domain and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs in the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in nonshearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and Verification of Physics-Informed Neural Models of the Grad-Shafranov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our contributions are motivated by fusion reactors that rely on maintaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium, where the balance between plasma pressure and confining magnetic fields is required for stable operation. In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) has been a long-standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low-mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using data from both the Montreal White Dwarf Database and a 20 pc volume-limited sample from Gaia DR2, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarf forms. Crystallization dynamos, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with the progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing a field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints, with mergers best able to explain the high mass, strongly magnetized young MWDs. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>

      <title>Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases with the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.</description>
