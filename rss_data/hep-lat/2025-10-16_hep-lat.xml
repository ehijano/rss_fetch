      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization to three loops in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic vacuum polarization at low virtualities limits the precision of experimental tests of the standard model via important physical observables. Here we compute that effect in two-flavor chiral perturbation theory to three loops. Among the master integrals that describe the amplitude, six are elliptic functions of the momentum. Of these five are new to this work, although all can be related to the three-loop sunset integral. The renormalizability of the amplitude hinges on relations between the master integrals that were not previously known and that are not consequences of the integration-by-parts reduction. Our result is intended to serve as a starting point for phenomenological calculations, as well as the computation of finite-volume corrections in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Neural Triangular Transport Maps: A New Approach Towards Sampling in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics; yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN). We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and \emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins). Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings) affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).</description>

      <title>First simultaneous analysis of transverse momentum dependent and collinear parton distributions in the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent (TMD) and collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton. Our study incorporates data from deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan, inclusive weak boson, $W$+\,charm, and jet production involving PDFs, as well as TMD Drell-Yan and $Z$-boson production data from fixed target and collider experiments sensitive to both TMD and collinear distributions. The analysis is performed at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for QCD resummation in TMD observables and next-to-leading order for observables described in collinear factorization. The combined analysis improves knowledge of both TMD and collinear PDFs, particularly in the sea-quark sector, providing a consistent simultaneous description of the aforementioned observables.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD. In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $g^2 \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same point of $r=0$. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A^a_\mu(s)A^a_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesons play a crucial role in understanding the strong interaction in the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, the mass and decay width of several ordinary and exotic mesons remain experimentally undetermined. In this work, we propose a novel application of advanced machine learning techniques to deal with this challenge. Due to the limited available meson datasets, traditional data-driven methods are norm To overcome this, we employ a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate synthetic meson data based on known physical parameters. This not only augments the dataset but also retain the underlying physics of the original mesons data. With the extended dataset, we train multiple copies of CGAN and apply a bagging technique to predict uncertainties, improving the robustness and reliability of the predictions. As our findings indicate, the CGAN models are capable of well describing meson properties and their structure relations, offering a potent novel instrument for hadron spectroscopy. This calculation opens a promising future for data-driven hadron physics studies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the hadron resonance gas with physical magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic properties of the Hadron Resonance Gas in the presence of a strong ($0 \le B \le 0.15~{\rm GeV}^2$) uniform magnetic field, using physical values of the magnetic moments of hadrons, i.e., including their anomalous parts. The values of these moments are taken from experiment, or when unavailable, from theoretical estimates. We evaluate the conserved charge susceptibilities, finding the expected sizable effects of the anomalous magnetic moments, in particular of the octet baryons, such as the proton and neutron, where they are exceptionally large. We also study in detail the large effects of the magnetic moments of the $\Delta(1232)$ states, for which various theoretical estimates and experimental values differ significantly. We compare our model results with the lattice QCD data and find reasonable agreement within the model uncertainty.</description>
