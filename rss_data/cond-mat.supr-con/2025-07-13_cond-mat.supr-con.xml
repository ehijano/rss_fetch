      <title>Long-Term Stability of Superconducting Metal Superhydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zhou et al., in their recent publication (Nat. Commun. 16, 1135, 2025), reported the synthesis of lanthanum superhydride, LaHx (x = 10.2-11.1), by laser heating LaH3 with NH3BH3 at a pressure of 170 GPa and investigated the temporal evolution of the NMR spectra of the reaction products. They observed a gradual decrease in the 1H-NMR signal intensity assigned to the synthesized metal hydride, accompanied by an increase in molecular hydrogen within the sample chamber over a period of 50 days. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that LaH10 progressively decomposes into LaH3 and H2 within two months after synthesis at its formation pressure of 170 GPa. Here, we demonstrate that, under their formation conditions, metal superhydrides are thermodynamically more stable than metal trihydrides. Furthermore, we present direct experimental evidence - based on X-ray diffraction and four-probe electrical resistance measurements - confirming the stability of both the crystal lattice and high-temperature superconducting properties of the Fm-3m-LaH10 phase for more than five years. This long-term stability is consistent with predictions from quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Charge distribution and magnetism in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: a hybrid functional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</description>

      <title>Control of nonreciprocal charge transport in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructures with Fermi level tuning and superconducting-layer thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport (NCT) is defined as a phenomenon where electrical resistance depends on the current direction. It has been drawing much attention because it sensitively reflects the symmetry breaking of material systems. A topological insulator (TI)/superconductor (SC) heterostructure where the topological surface state (TSS) of the TI layer is proximitized with the SC layer is one such system that presents a sizable NCT due to a large spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity. Here, we report a control of the magnitude and sign of NCT: reversal of the direction of NCT by tuning the Fermi energy of TSS of the TI layer with respect to the charge neutral point by systematic regulation of Sb composition $x$ in a TI/SC heterostructures of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$/FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$. The result is consistent with the model of a TSS proximitized with superconductivity. Furthermore, we find a significant enhancement of the magnitude of NCT in the TI/SC heterostructures by reducing the thickness of the SC layer. The enhancement can be ascribed to the inversion-symmetry breaking of the FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$ SC-layer itself adjacent to the TI layer. Our results highlight the essential role of the TSS for exhibiting NCT and offer new knobs to control the direction and magnitude of NCT.</description>

      <title>Strengthened correlations near [110] edges of $d$-wave superconductors in the t-J model with the Gutzwiller approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of a study of strongly correlated $d$-wave superconducting slabs within a t-J model solved using the statistically consistent Gutzwiller approach. For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</description>

      <title>A Cryogenic Uniaxial Strain Cell for Elastoresistance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and validation of a cryo-compatible strain cell for elastoresistance measurements in quantum materials. The cell is actuated by three large-format piezoelectric stacks and enables both compressive and tensile strain up to approximately $\pm5\%$. The relative displacement of the sample holders is measured in situ using a high-resolution capacitive displacement sensor, ensuring precise strain control throughout measurement. To operate the strain cell over a broad temperature range from 4.2\,K to 300\,K, a modular measurement probe was developed, allowing efficient thermal coupling and integration into cryogenic environments. The functionality and precision of the setup were demonstrated by elastoresistance measurements on the iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$As$_2$ along the [110] direction. The results were validated against conventional techniques based on glued samples and strain gauges, showing excellent agreement in amplitude and temperature dependence of the elastoresistance coefficient. Additional tests revealed that the system remains robust under mechanical vibrations introduced by vacuum pumps, enabling stable operation even with liquid nitrogen cooling. This highlights the high mechanical and thermal reliability of the developed platform for low-temperature transport measurements under controlled uniaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Scattering Approach to In-Gap States: Cr Adatoms on Superconducting \beta-Bi2Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic scattering formalism to describe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states due to a single Cr adatom on the Bi-terminated surface of $\beta-Bi_2Pd$, by combining ab initio Wannier functions with a real-space Green's function approach in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. Our framework reproduces key scanning tunneling spectroscopy features, including a single particle-hole asymmetric YSR peak and isotropic dIdV maps around the impurity. Decomposing the YSR states reveals contributions from four nearly degenerate C4v representations, with energy broadening masking their individual signatures. Spin-orbit coupling induces partial spin polarization, while the spatial asymmetry between particle and hole components arises from Cr d-Bi p hybridization. These results highlight the importance of realistic band structures and microscopic modeling for interpreting STM data and provide a foundation for studying impurity chains hosting topological excitations.</description>

      <title>Screened superexchange mechanism for superconductivity applied to cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1965, Kohn and Luttinger published a note revealing that dynamical screening of the repulsive Coulomb interaction leads under certain conditions to an effective attraction necessary for the formation of Cooper pairs. We propose such a formalism adapted to the cuprates where the screening arises from the superexchange dynamics of virtual holes in the oxygen orbitals of the $Cu O_2$ plane. Using an adequate Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, the basic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method and the {\it ab initio} data on orbitals (energy, hopping, interaction), we derive some predictions for the temperature-doping phase diagram (pseudo-gap, strange metal, antiferromagnetism, superconducting and normal states) and for the doping dependant band energy spectrum in semi-quantitative agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Emergent Harmonics in Josephson Tunnel Junctions Due to Series Inductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions are essential elements of superconducting quantum circuits. The operability of these circuits presumes a $2\pi$-periodic sinusoidal potential of a tunnel junction, but higher-order corrections to this Josephson potential, often referred to as "harmonics," cause deviations from the expected circuit behavior. Two potential sources for these harmonics are the intrinsic current-phase relationship of the Josephson junction and the inductance of the metallic traces connecting the junction to other circuit elements. Here, we introduce a method to distinguish the origin of the observed harmonics using nearly-symmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Spectroscopic measurements of level transitions in multiple devices reveal features that cannot be explained by a standard cosine potential, but are accurately reproduced when accounting for a second-harmonic contribution to the model. The observed scaling of the second harmonic with Josephson-junction size indicates that it is due almost entirely to the trace inductance. These results inform the design of next-generation superconducting circuits for quantum information processing and the investigation of the supercurrent diode effect.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Intertwined Density Waves in La$_4$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_x$O$_{10+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ has been reported to emerge upon suppression of intertwined spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) order, suggesting a possible connection to the pairing mechanism. Here we report a systematic investigation of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_{x}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.7$), focusing on the evolution of the SDW/CDW order as a function of chemical substitution. Temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall effect measurements reveal a linear suppression of density wave transition temperature $T{\text{dw}}$ and a concurrent enhancement of hole concentration with increasing Cu content. At higher substitution levels ($x &gt; 0.15$), the transition-induced anomaly in the resistivity becomes undetectable while a magnetic signature persists, indicating a partial decoupling of spin and charge components and the possible survival of short-range spin correlations. The absence of superconductivity across the substitution series highlights the importance of additional factors in stabilizing the superconducting state in pressurized La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Phase-Biased Andreev Diffraction Grating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In optical diffraction, the phase difference between sources in a grating or multi-slit mask is determined by the angle to the imaging screen, yielding the familiar multi-lobed diffraction image. Here, we realize a similar phenomenon in a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid circuit configured to allow Andreev scattering from multiple parallel scatterers. Phase differences between scatterers are set by tapping off of a remote superconducting meander. We investigate arrays with two, three, four, and ten Andreev scatterers, examining local and nonlocal diffraction patterns, finding good agreement with a theory of multiple Andreev scattering, not to be confused with multiple Andreev reflection. Adding current-carrying taps to the meander allows individual phase control.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: strain to mimic the effects pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed, bringing the apical Ni-O-Ni angle to 180$^\circ$ and causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Due to this strong interlayer coupling, a flat band of pure $d_{z^2}$ character crosses the Fermi level. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure: while compressive strain brings the apical Ni-O-Ni angle closer to 180$^\circ$, it shifts the $d_{z^2}$ flat bands away from the Fermi energy, giving rise to a more cuprate-like electronic structure. In contrast, tensile strain reduces the apical Ni-O-Ni angle (to values $\sim$ 160$^\circ$), but it recovers the flat $d_{z^2}$ band at the Fermi level appearing in the bilayer and trilayer RPs under pressure. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity at ambient pressure in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Structure factors and quantum geometry in multiband BCS superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.</description>
