      <title>Communications under Bursty Mixed Gaussian-impulsive Noise: Demodulation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of the two-part paper considering the communications under the bursty mixed noise composed of white Gaussian noise and colored non-Gaussian impulsive noise. In the first part, based on Gaussian distribution and student distribution, we proposed a multivariate bursty mixed noise model and designed model parameter estimation algorithms. However, the performance of a communication system will significantly deteriorate under the bursty mixed noise if a conventional signal detection algorithm with respect to Gaussian noise is applied. To address this issue, in the second part, we leverage the probability density function (PDF) to derive the maximum likelihood (ML) demodulation methods for both linear and nonlinear modulations, including M-array PSK (M-PSK) and MSK modulation schemes. We analyze the theoretical bit error rate (BER) performance of M-PSK and present close-form BER expressions. For the MSK demodulation based on the Viterbi algorithm, we derive a lower and upper bound of BER. Simulation results showcase that the proposed demodulation methods outperform baselines by more than 2.5dB when the BER performance reaches the order of magnitude of $10^{-3}$, and the theoretical analysis matches the simulated results well.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for CSI Feedback: One-Sided Model and Joint Multi-Module Learning Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of deep learning (DL) for channel state information (CSI) feedback has garnered widespread attention across academia and industry. The mainstream DL architectures, e.g., CsiNet, deploy DL models on the base station (BS) side and the user equipment (UE) side, which are highly coupled and need to be trained jointly. However, two-sided DL models require collaborations between different network vendors and UE vendors, which entails considerable challenges in order to achieve consensus, e.g., model maintenance and responsibility. Furthermore, DL-based CSI feedback design invokes DL to reduce only the CSI feedback error, whereas jointly optimizing several modules at the transceivers would provide more significant gains. This article presents DL-based CSI feedback from the perspectives of one-sided model and joint multi-module learning. We herein introduce various novel one-sided CSI feedback architectures. In particular, the recently proposed CSI-PPPNet provides a one-sided one-for-all framework, which allows a DL model to deal with arbitrary CSI compression ratios. We review different joint multi-module learning methods, where the CSI feedback module is learned jointly with other modules including channel coding, channel estimation, pilot design and precoding design. Finally, future directions and challenges for DL-based CSI feedback are discussed, from the perspectives of inherent limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) and practical deployment issues.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO: Wavenumber-Domain Sparsity Inspired Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sparse channel estimation for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems. Given that the wavenumber-domain representation is based on a series of Fourier harmonics that are in essence a series of orthogonal basis functions, a novel wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis is designed to expose the sparsity inherent in HMIMO channels. Furthermore, by harnessing the beneficial sparsity in the wavenumber domain, the sparse estimation of HMIMO channels is structured as a compressed sensing problem, which can be efficiently solved by our proposed wavenumber-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (WD-OMP) algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis maintains its detection accuracy regardless of the number of antenna elements and antenna spacing. Additionally, in the case of antenna spacing being much less than half a wavelength, the wavenumber-domain approach remains highly accurate in identifying the significant angular power of HMIMO channels.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Waveform and Beamforming Optimization for RF Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a key technology for future low-power wireless systems. However, the inherently low end-to-end power transfer efficiency (PTE) is challenging for practical applications. The main factors contributing to it are the channel losses, transceivers' power consumption, and losses related, e.g., to the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), high-power amplifier, and rectenna. Optimizing PTE requires careful consideration of these factors, motivating the current work. Herein, we consider an analog multi-antenna power transmitter that aims to charge a single energy harvester. We first provide a mathematical framework to calculate the harvested power from multi-tone signal transmissions and the system power consumption. Then, we formulate the joint waveform and analog beamforming design problem to minimize power consumption and meet the charging requirements. Finally, we propose an optimization approach relying on swarm intelligence to solve the specified problem. Simulation results quantify the power consumption reduction as the DAC, phase shifters resolution, and antenna length are increased, while it is seen that increasing system frequency results in higher power consumption.</description>

      <title>Maximum Correntropy Polynomial Chaos Kalman Filter for Underwater Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an underwater navigation solution that utilizes a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and fuses a set of auxiliary sensors such as an acoustic positioning system, Doppler velocity log, depth meter, attitude meter, and magnetometer to accurately estimate an underwater vessel's position and orientation. The conventional integrated navigation system assumes Gaussian measurement noise, while in reality, the noises are non-Gaussian, particularly contaminated by heavy-tailed impulsive noises. To address this issue, and to fuse the system model with the acquired sensor measurements efficiently, we develop a square root polynomial chaos Kalman filter based on maximum correntropy criteria. The filter is initialized using acoustic beaconing to accurately locate the initial position of the vehicle. The computational complexity of the proposed filter is calculated in terms of flops count. The proposed method is compared with the existing maximum correntropy sigma point filters in terms of estimation accuracy and computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate an improved accuracy compared to the conventional deterministic sample point filters.</description>

      <title>Shifting the ISAC Trade-Off with Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging antenna technology, a fluid antenna system (FAS) enhances spatial diversity to improve both sensing and communication performance by shifting the active antennas among available ports. In this letter, we study the potential of shifting the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) trade- off with FAS. We propose the model for FAS-enabled ISAC and jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and port selection of FAS. In particular, we aim to minimize the transmit power, while satisfying both communication and sensing requirements. An efficient iterative algorithm based on sparse optimization, convex approximation, and a penalty approach is developed. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can attain 33% reductions in transmit power with guaranteed sensing and communication performance, showing the great potential of the fluid antenna for striking a flexible tradeoff between sensing and communication in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Slice Wi-Fi Networks: A State-Augmented Primal-Dual Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing is a key feature in 5G/NG cellular networks that creates customized slices for different service types with various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, which can achieve service differentiation and guarantee service-level agreement (SLA) for each service type. In Wi-Fi networks, there is limited prior work on slicing, and a potential solution is based on a multi-tenant architecture on a single access point (AP) that dedicates different channels to different slices. In this paper, we define a flexible, constrained learning framework to enable slicing in Wi-Fi networks subject to QoS requirements. We specifically propose an unsupervised learning-based network slicing method that leverages a state-augmented primal-dual algorithm, where a neural network policy is trained offline to optimize a Lagrangian function and the dual variable dynamics are updated online in the execution phase. We show that state augmentation is crucial for generating slicing decisions that meet the ergodic QoS requirements.</description>

      <title>3D Positioning using a New Diffraction Path Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing 3D and Z-axis positioning accuracy is crucial for effective rescue in indoor emergencies, ensuring safety for emergency responders and at-risk individuals. Additionally, reducing the dependence of a positioning system on fixed infrastructure is crucial, given its vulnerability to power failures and damage during emergencies. Further challenges from a signal propagation perspective include poor indoor signal coverage, multipath effects and the problem of Non-Line-OfSight (NLOS) measurement bias. In this study, we utilize the mobility provided by a rapidly deployable Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based wireless network to address these challenges. We recognize diffraction from window edges as a crucial signal propagation mechanism and employ the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) to introduce a novel NLOS path length model. Using this path length model, we propose two different techniques to improve the indoor positioning performance for emergency scenarios.</description>

      <title>supDQN: Supervised Rewarding Strategy Driven Deep Q-Network for sEMG Signal Decontamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of muscles throughout the active parts of the body such as the upper and lower limbs, makes electromyography-based human-machine interaction prevalent. However, muscle signals are stochastic and noisy. These noises can be regular and irregular. Irregular noises due to movements or electrical switching require dynamic filtering. Conventionally, filters are stacked, which trims and delays the signal unnecessarily. This study introduces a decontamination technique involving a supervised rewarding strategy to drive a deep Q-network-based agent (supDQN). It applies one of three filters to decontaminate a 1sec long surface electromyography signal, which is dynamically contaminated. A machine learning agent identifies whether the signal after filtering is clean or noisy. Accordingly, a reward is generated. The identification accuracy is enhanced by using a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation. The deep Q-network is guided by this reward to select filter optimally while decontaminating a signal. The proposed filtering strategy is tested on four noise levels (-5 dB, -1 dB, +1 dB, +5 dB). supDQN filters the signal desirably when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is between -5 dB to +1 dB. It filters less desirably at high SNR (+5 dB). A normalized root mean square (nRMSE) is formulated to depict the difference of filtered signal from ground truth. This is used to compare supDQN and conventional methods including wavelet denoising with debauchies and symlet wavelet, high order low pass filter, notch filter, and high pass filter. The proposed filtering strategy gives an average value nRMSE of 1.1974, which is lower than the conventional filters.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Towed Cable with Sensor-Array for Underwater Target Motion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During a war situation, many times an underwater target motion analysis (TMA) is performed using bearing-only measurements, obtained from a sensor array, which is towed by an own-ship with the help of a connected cable. It is well known that the own-ship is required to perform a manoeuvre in order to make the system observable and localise the target successfully. During the maneuver, it is important to know the location of the sensor array with respect to the own-ship. This paper develops a dynamic model of a cable-sensor array system to localise the sensor array, which is towed behind a sea-surface vessel. We adopt a lumped-mass approach to represent the towed cable. The discretized cable elements are modelled as an interconnected rigid body, kinematically related to one another. The governing equations are derived by balancing the moments acting on each node. The derived dynamics are solved simultaneously for all the nodes to determine the orientation of the cable and sensor array. The position of the sensor array obtained from this proposed model will further be used by TMA algorithms to enhance the accuracy of the tracking system.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided AirComp: Multi-Timescale Design and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into over-the-air computation (AirComp) is an effective solution for reducing the computational mean squared error (MSE) via its high passive beamforming gain. Prior works on IRS aided AirComp generally rely on the full instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which is not applicable to large-scale systems due to its heavy signalling overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-timescale transmission protocol. In particular, the receive beamforming at the access point (AP) is pre-determined based on the static angle information and the IRS phase-shifts are optimized relying on the long-term statistical CSI. With the obtained AP receive beamforming and IRS phase-shifts, the effective low-dimensional I-CSI is exploited to determine devices' transmit power in each coherence block, thus substantially reducing the signalling overhead. Theoretical analysis unveils that the achievable MSE scales on the order of ${\cal O}\left( {K/\left( {{N^2}M} \right)} \right)$, where $M$, $N$, and $K$ are the number of AP antennas, IRS elements, and devices, respectively. We also prove that the channel-inversion power control is asymptotically optimal for large $N$, which reveals that the full power transmission policy is not needed for lowering the power consumption of energy-limited devices.</description>

      <title>Array SAR 3D Sparse Imaging Based on Regularization by Denoising Under Few Observed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Array synthetic aperture radar (SAR) three-dimensional (3D) imaging can obtain 3D information of the target region, which is widely used in environmental monitoring and scattering information measurement. In recent years, with the development of compressed sensing (CS) theory, sparse signal processing is used in array SAR 3D imaging. Compared with matched filter (MF), sparse SAR imaging can effectively improve image quality. However, sparse imaging based on handcrafted regularization functions suffers from target information loss in few observed SAR data. Therefore, in this article, a general 3D sparse imaging framework based on Regulation by Denoising (RED) and proximal gradient descent type method for array SAR is presented. Firstly, we construct explicit prior terms via state-of-the-art denoising operators instead of regularization functions, which can improve the accuracy of sparse reconstruction and preserve the structure information of the target. Then, different proximal gradient descent type methods are presented, including a generalized alternating projection (GAP) and an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM), which is suitable for high-dimensional data processing. Additionally, the proposed method has robust convergence, which can achieve sparse reconstruction of 3D SAR in few observed SAR data. Extensive simulations and real data experiments are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method has superior sparse reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Correlated MIMO Phase-Noise Channels: An Electro-Optic Frequency Comb Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capacity of a discrete-time multiple-input-multiple-output channel with correlated phase noises is investigated. In particular, the electro-optic frequency comb system is considered, where the phase noise of each channel is a combination of two independent Wiener phase-noise sources. Capacity upper and lower bounds are derived for this channel and are compared with lower bounds obtained by numerically evaluating the achievable information rates using quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. Capacity upper and lower bounds are provided for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The multiplexing gain (pre-log) is shown to be $M-1$, where $M$ represents the number of channels. A constant gap between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds is observed, which depends on the number of channels $M$. For the specific case of $M=2$, capacity is characterized up to a term that vanishes as the SNR grows large.</description>

      <title>A minimal dynamical system and analog circuit for non-associative learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning in living organisms is typically associated with networks of neurons. The use of large numbers of adjustable units has also been a crucial factor in the continued success of artificial neural networks. In light of the complexity of both living and artificial neural networks, it is surprising to see that very simple organisms -- even unicellular organisms that do not possess a nervous system -- are capable of certain forms of learning. Since in these cases learning may be implemented with much simpler structures than neural networks, it is natural to ask how simple the building blocks required for basic forms of learning may be. The purpose of this study is to discuss the simplest dynamical systems that model a fundamental form of non-associative learning, habituation, and to elucidate technical implementations of such systems, which may be used to implement non-associative learning in neuromorphic computing and related applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Indoor and Outdoor THz Communications with Beyond Diagonal-IRS: Optimization and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the application of Beyond Diagonal Intelligent Reflective Surface (BD-IRS) to enhance THz downlink communication systems, operating in a hybrid: reflective and transmissive mode, to simultaneously provide services to indoor and outdoor users. We propose an optimization framework that jointly optimizes the beamforming vectors and phase shifts in the hybrid reflective/transmissive mode, aiming to maximize the system sum rate. To tackle the challenges in solving the joint design problem, we employ the conjugate gradient method and propose an iterative algorithm that successively optimizes the hybrid beamforming vectors and the phase shifts. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in rate when compared to existing benchmark schemes, including time- and frequency-divided approaches, by approximately $30.5\%$ and $69.9\%$ respectively and even outperforms the STAR-IRS system by $76.99\%$. This underscores the significant influence of IRS elements on system performance relative to that of base station antennas, highlighting their pivotal role in advancing the communication system efficacy.</description>

The objective is to conceal the legitimate communication link under the surveillance of a warden. The main content is as follows: first, we propose a novel strategy for generating artificial noise signals in the considered covert scenario. Then, we leverage the statistical information of channel coefficients to optimize the basis matrix of the artificial noise signals space in the absence of accurate channel fading information between the friendly interference nodes and the legitimate receiver. The optimization problem aims to design artificial noise signals within the space to facilitate covert communication while minimizing the impact on the performance of legitimate communication. Second, a customized Rimannian Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (R-SVRG) algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem. In the algorithm, we employ the Riemannian optimization framework to analyze the geometric structure of the basis matrix constraints and transform the original non-convex optimization problem into an unconstrained problem on the complex Stiefel manifold for solution. Third, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point. In the end, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy for generating artificial noise signals through numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the Gaussian artificial noise strategy without optimization.</description>

      <title>A Novel RFID Authentication Protocol Based on A Block-Order-Modulus Variable Matrix Encryption Algorithm</title>

Abstract: In this paper, authentication for mobile radio frequency identification (RFID) systems with low-cost tags is studied. Firstly, an adaptive modulus (AM) encryption algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, in order to enhance the security without additional storage of new key matrices, a self-updating encryption order (SUEO) algorithm is designed. Furthermore, a diagonal block local transpose key matrix (DBLTKM) encryption algorithm is presented, which effectively expands the feasible domain of the key space. Based on the above three algorithms, a novel joint AM-SUEO-DBLTKM encryption algorithm is constructed. Making full use of the advantages of the proposed joint algorithm, a two-way RFID authentication protocol, named AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID, is proposed for mobile RFID systems. In addition, the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and security analysis indicate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol can effectively combat various typical attacks. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM algorithm can save 99.59\% of tag storage over traditional algorithms. Finally, the low computational complexity as well as the low storage cost of the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol facilitates deployment within low-cost RFID tags.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Holographic MIMO Based Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14129</link>

Abstract: Given the high spectral efficiency, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology holds promise for enhancing both sensing and communication capabilities. However, accurately characterizing its performance poses a challenge due to the spatial correlation induced by densely spaced antennas. In this paper, a holographic MIMO (HMIMO) based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. The spacial correlation is incorporated in the communication channel modeling, while an accurate spherical wave-based model is utilized to characterize sensing link. By considering both instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and statistical CSI, closed-form expressions are derived for sensing rates (SRs), communication rates (CRs), and outage probabilities under different ISAC designs to investigate the theoretical performance limits of the proposed HISAC framework. Further insights are gained by examining high signal-to-noise ratio slopes and diversity orders. Specifically, i) for the downlink case, a sensing-centric (S-C) design and a communications-centric (C-C) design are investigated based on different beamforming strategies, and a Pareto optimal design is proposed to characterize the attainable SR-CR region; ii) for the uplink case, the S-C design and the C-C design are distinguished by the interference cancellation order of the communication signal and the sensing signal, and the rate region is obtained through a time-sharing strategy. Numerical results reveal that HMIMO based ISAC (HISAC) systems outperform both conventional MIMO based ISAC systems and HMIMO based frequency-division sensing and communications systems, underscoring the superior performance of HISAC.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that utilizes localized antenna movement to pursue better channel conditions for enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we study the MA-enhanced multicast transmission from a base station equipped with multiple MAs to multiple groups of single-MA users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users by jointly optimizing the position of each transmit/receive MA and the transmit beamforming. To tackle this challenging problem, we first consider the single-group scenario and propose an efficient algorithm based on the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Particularly, when optimizing transmit or receive MA positions, we construct a concave lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user by applying only the second-order Taylor expansion, which is more effective than existing works utilizing two-step approximations. The proposed design is then extended to the general multi-group scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that significant performance gains in terms of achievable max-min SNR/SINR can be obtained by our proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can notably reduce the required amount of transmit power or antennas for achieving a target level of max-min SNR/SINR performance compared to benchmark schemes.</description>
