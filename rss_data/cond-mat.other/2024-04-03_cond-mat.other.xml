      <title>Continuously tunable uniaxial strain control of van der Waals heterostructure devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniaxial strain has been widely used as a powerful tool for investigating and controlling the properties of quantum materials. However, existing strain techniques have so far mostly been limited to use with bulk crystals. Although recent progress has been made in extending the application of strain to two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, these techniques have been limited to optical characterization and extremely simple electrical device geometries. Here, we report a piezoelectric-based in-situ uniaxial strain technique enabling simultaneous electrical transport and optical spectroscopy characterization of dual-gated vdW heterostructure devices. Critically, our technique remains compatible with vdW heterostructure devices of arbitrary complexity fabricated on conventional silicon/silicon dioxide wafer substrates. We demonstrate a large and continuously tunable strain of up to $0.15$\% at millikelvin temperatures, with larger strain values also likely achievable. We quantify the strain transmission from the silicon wafer to the vdW heterostructure, and further demonstrate the ability of strain to modify the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. Our technique provides a highly versatile new method for exploring the effect of uniaxial strain on both the electrical and optical properties of vdW heterostructures, and can be easily extended to include additional characterization techniques.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Orbital Hall Effect in Spin-Orbit Torque MRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) devices offer improved power efficiency, nonvolatility, and performance compared to static RAM, making them ideal, for instance, for cache memory applications. Efficient magnetization switching, long data retention, and high-density integration in SOT MRAM require ferromagnets (FM) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) combined with large torques enhanced by Orbital Hall Effect (OHE). We have engineered PMA [Co/Ni]$_3$ FM on selected OHE layers (Ru, Nb, Cr) and investigated the potential of theoretically predicted larger orbital Hall conductivity (OHC) to quantify the torque and switching current in OHE/[Co/Ni]$_3$ stacks. Our results demonstrate a $\sim$30\% enhancement in damping-like torque efficiency with a positive sign for the Ru OHE layer compared to a pure Pt, accompanied by a $\sim$20\% reduction in switching current for Ru compared to pure Pt across more than 250 devices, leading to more than a 60\% reduction in switching power. These findings validate the application of Ru in devices relevant to industrial contexts, supporting theoretical predictions regarding its superior OHC. This investigation highlights the potential of enhanced orbital torques to improve the performance of orbital-assisted SOT-MRAM, paving the way for next-generation memory technology.</description>

      <title>He-4 monolayer on Graphene: a Quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>
