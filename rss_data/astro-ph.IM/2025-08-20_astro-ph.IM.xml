      <title>VIPCALs: A fully-automated calibration pipeline for VLBI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a powerful technique that can achieve sub-milliarcsecond resolution. However, it requires complex and often manual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and propagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI arrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and existing pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision. We present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for continuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge of the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and heterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives such as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python using ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow in a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline also performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification, and generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a representative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to 1 000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated observations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over 91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in at least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated visibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing time was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and scalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated calibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier for VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible.</description>

      <title>Evolution of JWST Contingency Payload Operations for Mitigating NIRSpec Micro-shutter Array Electrical Shorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is one of four science instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which began routine operations in July 2022. As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant targets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science goals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the simultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the field of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000 individually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters.
  The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce unwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting valuable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the affected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to prevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces NIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of masking while reliably suppressing the short's effects.
  More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical procedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This experience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected rows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of multiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost.
  As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain relevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation operations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning, and describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued science productivity from this unique payload.</description>

      <title>The CCOR Compact Coronagraphs for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-19 (GOES-19) and the Space Weather Follow On (SWFO) Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CCOR Compact Coronagraph is a series of two operational solar coronagraphs sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740 nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example, but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end, information on ground processing and data levels is provided.</description>

      <title>In orbit operation of Resolve Filter Wheel and MXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Resolve soft X-ray spectrometer is the high spectral resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer for the XRISM mission. In the beam of Resolve there is a filter wheel containing \xray{} filters. In the beam also is an active calibration source (the modulated X-ray source (MXS) that can provide pulsed \xray s to facilitate gain calibration.
  The filter wheel consists of six filter positions. Two open positions, one $^{55}$Fe source to aid in spectrometer characterization during the commissioning phase, and three transmission filters: a neutral density filter, an optical blocking filter, and a beryllium filter.
  The X-ray intensity, pulse period, and pulse separation of a MXS are highly configurable. Furthermore, the switch--on time is synchronized with the spacecraft's internal clock to give accurate start and end times of the pulses.
  One of the issues raised during ground testing was the susceptibility of a MXS at high voltage to ambient light. Although measures were taken to mitigate the light leak, the efficacy of those measures must be verified in orbit. Along with an overview of issues raised during ground testing, this article will discuss the calibration source and the filter performance in--flight and compare with the transmission curves present in the Resolve calibration database.</description>

      <title>Offline Neutrino Filtering using a Convolutional Neural Network-Based Algorithm at the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino astronomy is a vibrant field of study in astrophysics, offering unique insights into the Universe's most energetic phenomena. The combination of a low cross section and zero electromagnetic charge ensure that a neutrino retains most information about its original source while traversing the universe. On the other hand, these low cross sections, combined with a reduced flux at higher energies, make the neutrino one of the most elusive particles to detect in the standard model. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice sheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced by the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux forces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured data being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations. Hence, a sophisticated and robust filter is needed to differentiate between neutrino-like signals and noise. In this contribution we present the current work on the development of such a filter, based on a convolutional neural network architecture. The network employed uses real RNO-G data and simulated neutrino signals to categorize measured data as noise or neutrino-like events.</description>

      <title>SPARCS -- combining radiation hydrodynamics with non-equilibrium metal chemistry in the SWIFT astrophysical code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SPARCS, which combines the moment-based radiative transfer method SPH-M1RT with the non-equilibrium metal chemistry solver CHIMES in the modern highly-parallel astrophysical code SWIFT. SPARCS enables on-the-fly radiation hydrodynamics simulations, with multi-frequency ultraviolet radiative transfer coupled with all ionisation states of 11 major elements, in the presence of dust, cosmic ray ionization and heating, and self-gravity. Direct radiation pressure on gas and dust is also accounted for. We validate SPARCS against analytic solutions and standard photo-ionization codes such as CLOUDY in idealized tests. As an example application, we simulate an ionization front propagating through an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with solar metallicity. We produce mock optical emission line observations with the level population calculation code HyLight and the diagnostic radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that non-equilibrium effects and inhomogeneities can boost the low ion fractions by up to an order of magnitude. Possible applications of SPARCS include studying the dynamical impact of radiation on gas in star-forming regions, and in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium, as well as interpreting line diagnostics in such environments, and galactic or AGN outflows.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive spectroscopic reference of the solar system and its application to exoplanet direct imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13368v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.</description>

      <title>MaxWave: Rapid Maximum Likelihood Wavelet Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian features in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low-latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations; (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions; and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to de-noise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational-wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also aid machine learning applications that aim to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain, Gaussian-noise-free reconstructions of any glitch.</description>

      <title>PHECT: A lightweight computation tool for pulsar halo emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\gamma$-ray pulsar halos, formed by inverse Compton scattering of electrons and positrons propagating in the pulsar-surrounding interstellar medium with background photons, serve as an ideal probe for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation on small scales (typically tens of parsecs). While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as normal diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond normal diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous coefficients. PHECT is ready for the increasingly precise observational data and the rapidly growing sample of pulsar halos.</description>

      <title>Detecting False Positives With Derived Planetary Parameters: Experimenting with the KEPLER Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in computational power and machine learning techniques motivate their use in many different astrophysical research areas. Consequently, many machine learning models have been trained to classify exoplanet transit signals - typically done by using time series light curves. In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant information contained in a light curve. Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks produce the highest accuracy and the best precision-recall trade-off. We also note that the accuracies as a function of the stellar eclipse flag SS have the best performance.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Performance of $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga, Al)_5O_{12}}$:Ce Scintillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope) mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2 different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time. Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2 K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Hunting for new glitches in LIGO data using community science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO contain many types of noise. Glitches are short bursts of non-Gaussian noise that may hinder our ability to identify or analyse gravitational-wave signals. They may have instrumental or environmental origins, and new types of glitches may appear following detector changes. The Gravity Spy project studies glitches and their origins, combining insights from volunteers on the community-science Zooniverse platform with machine learning. Here, we study volunteer proposals for new glitch classes, discussing links between these glitches and the state of the detectors, and examining how new glitch classes pose a challenge for machine-learning classification. Our results demonstrate how Zooniverse empowers non-experts to make discoveries, and the importance of monitoring changes in data quality in the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Learning to Estimate Photospheric Vector Fields from Line-of-Sight Magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms are easier to estimate than full vector magnetograms since the line-of-sight component (Blos) can be obtained from total intensity and circular polarization signals, unlike the perpendicular component (Bperp), which depends on harder-to-measure linear polarization. Unfortunately, the line of sight component by itself is not physically meaningful, as it is just one component of the underlying vector and one whose relationship to gravity changes pixel-to-pixel. To produce an estimate of the radial component (Br) a common ``correction'' is often applied that assumes the field is radial, which is nearly always false. This paper investigates recovering full vector field information from Blos by building on the recent SuperSynthIA approach that was originally used with Stokes vectors as input for simultaneous inversion and disambiguation. As input, the method accepts one or more line-of-sight magnetograms and associated metadata; as output, our method estimates full vector field in heliographic components, meaning that the physically-relevant vector components are returned without need for further disambiguation steps or component transforms. We demonstrate the ability to produce good estimates of the full vector field on unseen examples from both HMI and GONG, including examples that predate the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission. Our results show that learning is not a replacement for a dedicated vector-field observing facilities, but may serve to unlock information from past data and at the very least, provide more accurate Br maps from Blos than are created using the simple viewing angle assumption.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.</description>

      <title>Fractality of open clusters in singles, pairs, and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Data Compression with Noise Suppression for Inference under Noisy Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many fields including cosmology, statistical inference often relies on Gaussian likelihoods whose covariance matrices are estimated from a finite number of simulations. This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the covariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the Dodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the Massively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm offers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate the DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy covariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered MOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information retention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law transformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against standard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey. Our results demonstrate that $p$-MOPED consistently outperforms other approaches, especially in regimes with limited simulations, offering a robust compression strategy for high-dimensional data analyses under practical constraints.</description>

      <title>GWSkyNet-Multi II: an updated machine learning model for rapid classification of gravitational-wave events</title>

Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II, an updated model targeted towards providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star-black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values that are more interpretable. For significant event alerts issued during O4a and O4b, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Luminosity Function and Delay-Time Distribution of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts for Multimessenger Gravitational-Wave Detection Rate Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical redshift-luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the Gaussian delay model statistically preferred over the power-law and lognormal delay models based on the Deviance Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $R_{\mathrm{sGRB}}(0)=1.37_{-0.27}^{+0.30}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}). For GW detection, we examine two International GW Networks (IGWN): a four-detector network consisting of LIGO Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA (IGWN4) and an upcoming five-detector network that includes these four detectors plus LIGO India (IGWN5). Incorporating the angular dependence of sGRB jet emission energy, our results show that for different delay-time distribution models, the joint sGRB and GW detection rates for \emph{Fermi}, \emph{SVOM}, and \emph{EP} with IGWN4 (IGWN5) lie within 0.19--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.93--1.35 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), 0.07--0.10 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.51--0.79 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), and 0.01--0.03 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.15--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), respectively.</description>
