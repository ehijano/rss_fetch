      <title>Deep Photometric Observations of Ultra-Faint Milky Way Satellites Centaurus I and Eridanus IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep Magellan$+$Megacam imaging of Centaurus I (Cen I) and Eridanus IV (Eri IV), two recently discovered Milky Way ultra-faint satellites. Our data reach $\sim2-3$ magnitudes deeper than the discovery data from the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey. We use these data to constrain their distances, structural properties (e.g., half-light radii, ellipticity, and position angle), and luminosities. We investigate whether these systems show signs of tidal disturbance, and identify new potential member stars using Gaia EDR3. Our deep color-magnitude diagrams show that Cen I and Eri IV are consistent with an old ($\tau\sim 13.0$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($\text{[Fe/H]}\le-2.2$) stellar population. We find Cen I to have a half-light radius of $r_{h}=2.60\pm0.30'$ ($90.6\pm11$ pc), an ellipticity of $\epsilon=0.36\pm0.05$, a distance of $D=119.8\pm4.1$ kpc ($m-M=20.39\pm0.08$ mag), and an absolute magnitude of $M_{V}=-5.39\pm0.19$. Similarly, Eri IV has $r_{h}=3.24\pm0.48'$ ($65.9\pm10$ pc), $\epsilon=0.26\pm0.09$, $D=69.9\pm3.6$ kpc ($m-M=19.22\pm0.11$ mag), and $M_{V}=-3.55\pm0.24$. These systems occupy a space on the size-luminosity plane consistent with other known Milky Way dwarf galaxies which supports the findings from our previous spectroscopic follow-up. Cen I has a well-defined morphology which lacks any clear evidence of tidal disruption, whereas Eri IV hosts a significant extended feature with multiple possible interpretations.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Half-Mass Radii and Color Gradients for Young and Old Quiescent Galaxies at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3$ with JWST/PRIMER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between $0.5&lt;z&lt;3,$ tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey. Half-light radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455 quiescent galaxies with log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$&gt;10$, whereas half-mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the F277W-F444W color-$M_*$/L relation. We investigate the dependence of the ratio $r_{e, \mathrm{mass}}/r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$ on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength used to measure $r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$, also separating the sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies. Our data demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical wavelengths (0.5-0.7$\mu$m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only minor variations in redshift. We find that the average size of young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent galaxies at intermediate masses, $10&lt;$log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$&lt;11$, within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius measurements. At face value, our results point to a combination of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at $0.5&lt;z&lt;3$. Our results further indicate that the varying contributions to the general quiescent population by young and old quiescent galaxies can mimic evolution in redshift.</description>

      <title>Another piece to the puzzle: radio detection of a JWST discovered AGN candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of $\sim$700 JWST discovered AGN candidates ($z\sim2-11$) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a radio-loudness of $R\approx0.5$. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of $T_b \gtrsim 10^{3}$ K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3$\sigma$ limit $L_{1.3\text{GHz}} &lt; 1.3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (rms of $\sim$0.15 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $z_{\text{median}}=6.1$) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical $L_X - L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ and $L_X - L_R$ correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.</description>

      <title>The Catalogue of Virtual Early-Type Galaxies from IllustrisTNG: Validation and Real Observation Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are reference systems to understand galaxy formation and evolution processes. The physics of their collapse and internal dynamics are codified in well-known scaling relations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations play an important role, providing insights into the 3D distribution of matter and galaxy formation mechanisms, as well as validating methods to infer the properties of real objects. In this work, we present the closest-to-reality sample of ETGs from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation, dubbed "virtual-ETGs," based on an observational-like algorithm that combines standard projected and three-dimensional galaxy structural parameters. We extract 2D photometric information by projecting the galaxies' light into three planes and modeling them via S\'ersic profiles. Aperture velocity dispersions, corrected for softened central dynamics, are calculated along the line-of-sight orthogonal to the photometric projection plane. Central mass density profiles assume a power-law model, while 3D masses remain unmodified from the IllustrisTNG catalogue. The final catalogue includes $10121$ galaxies at redshifts $z \leq 0.1$. By comparing the virtual properties with observations, we find that the virtual-ETG scaling relations (e.g., size-mass, size-central surface brightness, and Faber-Jackson), central density slopes, and scaling relations among total density slopes and galaxy structural parameters are generally consistent with observations. We make the virtual-ETG publicly available for galaxy formation studies and plan to use this sample as a training set for machine learning tools to infer galaxy properties in future imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS): survey overview and the result of global mass-metallicity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass galaxies are the building blocks of massive galaxies in the framework of hierarchical structure formation. To enable detailed studies of galactic ecosystems in dwarf galaxies by spatially resolving different galactic components, we have carried out the Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS). This survey aims to acquire observations with spatial resolutions as high as 10 to 100 pc while maintaining reasonably high signal-to-noise ratios with VLT/MUSE and ANU-2.3m/WiFeS. The whole sample will be composed of 65 dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm \ast}$ $&lt;$ 10$^{9}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, selected from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy Survey. The overall scientific goals include studying baryonic cycles in dwarf galaxies, searching for off-nuclear (intermediate)-massive black holes, and quantifying the inner density profiles of dark matter. In this work, we describe the sample selection, data reduction, and high-level data products. By integrating the spectra over the field of view for each galaxy, we obtained the integrated gas-phase metallicity and discussed its dependence on stellar mass and SFR. We find that the overall relation between metallicity and stellar mass of our DGIS nearly follows the extrapolation from the higher mass end. Its dispersion does not decrease by invoking the dependence on SFR.</description>

      <title>The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) VI: The RACS-high 1655.5 MHz images and catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a widefield, wideband, snapshot survey using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) referred to as the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). RACS covers $\approx$ 90% of the sky, with multiple observing epochs in three frequency bands sampling the ASKAP frequency range of 700 to 1800 MHz. This paper describes the third major epoch at 1655.5 MHz, RACS-high, and the subsequent imaging and catalogue data release. The RACS-high observations at 1655.5 MHz are otherwise similar to the previously released RACS-mid (at 1367.5 MHz), and were calibrated and imaged with minimal changes. From the 1493 images covering the sky up to declination $\approx$ +48$^\circ$, we present a catalogue of 2 677 509 radio sources. The catalogue is constructed from images with a median root-mean-square noise of $\approx$ 195 $\mu$Jy PSF$^{-1}$ (point-spread function) and a median angular resolution of 11.8" by 8.1". The overall reliability of the catalogue is estimated to be 99.18%, and we find a decrease in reliability as angular resolution improves. We estimate the brightness scale to be accurate to 10%, and the astrometric accuracy to be within $\approx$ 0.6" in right ascension and $\approx$ 0.7" in declination after correction of a systematic declination-dependent offset. All data products from RACS-high, including calibrated visibility datasets, images from individual observations, full-sensitivity mosaics, and the all-sky catalogue are available at the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive.</description>

      <title>Multiple Populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 2257: No Major Environmental Effect on the Formation of Multiple Populations of the Old Globular Clusters in Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How the environment of the host galaxy affects the formation of multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is one of the outstanding questions in the near-field cosmology. To understand the true nature of the old GC MPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the Ca--CN--CH photometry of the old metal-poor LMC GC NGC 2257. We find the predominantly FG-dominated populational number ratio of $n$(FG):$n$(SG) = 61:39($\pm$4), where the FG and SG denote the first and second generations. Both the FG and SG have similar cumulative radial distributions, consistent with the idea that NGC 2257 is dynamically old. We obtain [Fe/H] = $-$1.78$\pm$0.00 dex($\sigma$=0.05 dex) and our metallicity is $\sim$0.2 dex larger than that from the high-resolution spectroscopy by other, due to their significantly lower temperatures by $\sim$ $-$200 K. The NGC 2257 FG shows a somewhat larger metallicity variation than the SG, the first detection of such phenomenon in an old LMC GC, similar to Galactic GCs with MPs, strongly suggesting that it is a general characteristic of GCs with MPs. Interestingly, the NGC 2257 SG does not show a helium enhancement compared to the FG. Our results for the Galactic normal GCs exhibit that the degree of carbon and nitrogen variations are tightly correlated with the GC mass, while NGC 2257 exhibits slightly smaller variations for its mass. We show that old LMC GCs follow the same trends as the Galactic normal GCs in the $\Delta$W$_{\rm CF336W,F438W,F814W}$, $N_{\rm FG}/N_{\rm tot}$, and $\log M/M_{\rm \odot}$ domains. Our result indicates that the environment of the host galaxy did not play a major role in the formation and evolution of GC MPs.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Peculiar Embedded Icy Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards two peculiar icy objects, which were discovered serendipitously by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Previous infrared observations have reported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are often seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting behind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED models of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected compact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects. The observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects, as well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated with shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected from their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected, which would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source sizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO clouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs, the presence of deep dust/ice absorption features, compact source size, and SiO-dominated broad molecular line emission, cannot easily be accounted for by any of known interstellar ice-absorption sources. They may represent a previously unknown type of isolated icy objects.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Solutions of Evolving Nuclear Star Clusters with Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo Dynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently developed a Monte-Carlo method (GNC) that can simulate the dynamical evolution of a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC) with a massive black hole (MBH), where the two-body relaxations can be solved by the Fokker-Planck equations in energy and angular momentum space. Here we make a major update of GNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that we can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the MBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass growth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous studies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\sim 17t_{\rm rh}$ by GNC, where $t_{\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study the cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH assuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars (e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the simulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by galaxies. Such scenario is possible to produce MBHs with mass $10^5\sim 10^7\,M_\odot$ for NSCs with stellar mass of $10^6\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$. In Milky-Way's NSC, to grow MBH up to $4\times 10^6\,M_\odot$, its size needs to be $\sim 1.7$ times more compact in early universe than the current value. MBHs with current masses $&gt;6\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$ seem difficult to explain by loss-cone accretion alone, and thus may require other additional accretion channels, such as gas accretion.</description>

      <title>Fully comprehensive diagnostic of galaxy activity using principal components of visible spectra: implementation on nearby S0s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel galaxy classification methodology based on the visible spectra of a sample of over 68,000 nearby ($z\leq 0.1$) Sloan Digital Sky Survey lenticular (S0) galaxies. Unlike traditional diagnostic diagrams, which rely on a limited set of emission lines and class dividers to identify ionizing sources, our approach provides a comprehensive framework for characterizing galaxies regardless of their activity level. By projecting galaxies into the 2D latent space defined by the first three principal components (PCs) of their entire visible spectra, our method remains robust even when data from individual emission lines are missing. We employ Gaussian kernel density estimates of the classical Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) activity classes in the new classification subspace, adjusted according to their relative abundance in our S0 sample, to generate probability maps for star-forming, Seyfert, composite, and LINER galaxies. These maps closely mirror the canonical distribution of BPT classes shown by the entire galaxy population, demonstrating that our PC-based taxonomy effectively predicts the dominant ionizing mechanisms through a probabilistic approach that provides a realistic reflection of galaxy activity and allows for refined class membership. Our analysis further reveals that flux-limited BPT-like diagrams are inherently biased against composite and star-forming galaxies due to their weaker [OIII] emission. Besides, it suggests that although most low-activity galaxies excluded from these diagnostics exhibit visual spectra with LINER-like characteristics, their remaining activity is likely driven by mechanisms unrelated to either star formation or supermassive black hole accretion. A machine-readable catalogue listing BPT-class probabilities for the galaxies analysed is available online at the CDS website.</description>

      <title>Detection of thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS) in TMC-1: sulfur-oxygen differentiation along the hydrogenation sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium has experienced a renewed interest due to the detection of a large variety of molecules containing sulfur. Here we report the first identification in space of a new S-bearing molecule, thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS), which is the sulfur counterpart of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a Yebes 40m Q band line survey of the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We detected seven individual lines corresponding to A and E components of the four most favorable rotational transitions of CH3CHS covered in the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz). Assuming a rotational temperature of 9 K, we derive a column density of 9.8e10 cm-2 for CH3CHS, which implies that it is 36 times less abundant than its oxygen counterpart CH3CHO. By comparing the column densities of the O- and S-bearing molecules detected in TMC-1, we find that as molecules increase their degree of hydrogenation, sulfur-bearing molecules become less abundant compared to their oxygen analog. That is, hydrogenation seems to be less favored for S-bearing molecules than for O-bearing ones in cold sources like TMC-1. We explored potential formation pathways to CH3CHS and implemented them into a chemical model, which however underestimates by several orders of magnitude the observed abundance of thioacetaldehyde. Quantum chemical calculations carried out for one of the potential formation pathways, the S + C2H5 reaction, indicate that formation of CH3CHS is only a minor channel in this reaction.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the radio source associated with Project Hephaistos Dyson Sphere Candidate G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution e-MERLIN and EVN (e-VLBI) observations of a radio source associated with Dyson Sphere candidate G, identified as part of Project Hephaistos. The radio source, VLASS J233532.86-000424.9, is resolved into 3 compact components and shows the typical characteristics of a radio-loud AGN. In particular, the EVN observations show that it has a brightness temperature in excess of $10^{8}$~K. No radio emission is detected at the position of the M-dwarf star. This result confirms our earlier hypothesis, that at least some of the Dyson Sphere candidates of project Hephaistos are contaminated by obscured, background AGN, lying close to the line of sight of otherwise normal galactic stars. High-resolution radio observations of other Dyson Sphere candidates can be useful in distinguishing truly promising candidates from those contaminated by background sources.</description>

      <title>Vertical Kinematics of the Young Galactic Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young disc vertical phase is paramount in our understanding of Galaxy evolution. Analysing the vertical kinematics at different galactic regions provides important information about the space-time variations of the Galactic potential. The vertical phase snail-shell structure found after Gaia DR2 release encompasses a wide range of ages. %\citep{2018Natur.561..360A, Antoja23}. However, the structure of the $V_Z\, vs \, Z$ diagram appears linear when the analysis is limited to studying objects younger than 30 Ma. Based on the vertical velocity and height-over-disc maps obtained for a sample of young open clusters, this method also allows the matter density in the Solar neighbourhood to be estimated using a completely different approach than previously found in the literature. We use two different catalogues of star clusters to confirm the previous result and study new age ranges. The linear pattern between $V_Z$ and $Z$ shows different slopes, $\partial V_Z/\partial Z$, for various age groups. The results fit a simple model (harmonic oscillator) of in-plane decoupled vertical dynamics up to a certain age limit, corresponding to $\sim$ 30 Ma. This work also analyses the relationship between the local volumetric density of matter ($\rho_0$) and the disc vertical kinematics for different age ranges, all below 50 Ma. The best estimates of the effective volumetric mass density in the Solar neighbourhood, 0.09-0.15 M$_\odot$ pc${}^{-3}$, agree with those given by other authors, assessing the reliability of the proposed dynamical model. These values are a minorant of the actual matter density in the region.</description>

      <title>Revealing the hidden cosmic feast: A z=4.3 galaxy group hosting two optically dark, efficiently star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the confirmation of a compact galaxy group candidate, CGG-z4, at $z=4.3$ in the COSMOS field. This structure was identified by two spectroscopically confirmed $z=4.3$ $K_s$-dropout galaxies with ALMA $870\rm\, \mu m$ and 3 mm continuum detections, surrounded by an overdensity of NIR-detected galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts of $4.0&lt;z&lt;4.6$. The two ALMA sources, CGG-z4.a and CGG-z4.b, are detected with both CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines. [CI](1-0) is detected on CGG-z4.a, and H$_{2}$O($1_{1,0}-1_{0,1}$) absorption is detected on CGG-z4.b. We model an integrated spectral energy distribution by combining the FIR-to-radio photometry of this group and estimate a total star formation rate of $\rm\sim2000\, M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, making it one of the most star-forming groups known at $z&gt;4$. Their high CO(5-4)/CO(4-3) ratios indicate that the inter-stellar mediums (ISMs) are close to thermalization, suggesting either high gas temperatures, densities, and/or pressure, while the low [CI](1-0)/CO(4-3) line ratios indicate high star formation efficiencies. With [CI]-derived gas masses we found the two galaxies have extremely short gas depletion times of $99$ Myr and $&lt;63$ Myr respectively, suggesting the onset of quenching. With an estimated halo mass of $\rm log (M_{\rm halo}[M_{\odot}])\sim12.8$, we suggest that this structure is likely in the process of forming a massive galaxy cluster.</description>

      <title>Forecast of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae time delay measurement by Muztage-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong lensing time delay measurement is a promising method to address the Hubble tension, offering a completely independent approach compared to both the cosmic microwave background analysis and the local distance ladder. As a third-party examination of the Hubble tension, this method provides a unique perspective. Strongly lensed quasar (glQSO) systems have demonstrated significant potential in tackling this issue, achieving an impressive \(2\%\) accuracy level. However, advancing to \(1\%\) or sub-percent accuracy is challenging due to several intrinsic limitations of glQSOs. Fortunately, strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) offer a more robust solution, thanks to their characteristic light curve, significant brightness variations, and additional advantages. The Muztagh-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope (MOST) is an exceptional instrument for monitoring strong lensing time delays. In this study, we simulate the follow-up multi-band light curve monitoring for glSNe Ia systems, which are expected to be firstly discovered by the Chinese Survey Space Telescope (CSST). Our results show that with \(300s \times 9\) exposures in each epoch, MOST can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of approximately 50 for the brightest images of glSNe Ia, while even the faintest images maintain an SNR of at least 7. Using a standard SNe Ia light curve template for fitting, we measured the time delays. With a 2-day cadence, MOST achieves a time delay error of only a few hours, with the bias typically remaining below one hour. This study highlights the capability of MOST to significantly advance the precision of time delay measurements, offering a promising path toward resolving the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight the potential benefits of a synergistic use of SKAO and ESO facilities for galaxy evolution studies, focusing on the role that ESO spectroscopic surveys can play in supporting next-generation radio continuum and atomic hydrogen (HI) surveys. More specifically we illustrate the role that currently available or soon to be operational ESO multiplex spectrographs can play for three classes of projects: large/deep redshift survey campaigns, integral field unit/Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (IFU/ALMA) surveys of selected regions of sky, and IFU/ALMA follow-ups of selected samples. We conclude with some general recommendations for an efficient joint exploitation of ESO-SKAO surveys.</description>

      <title>Nebular emission from composite star-forming galaxies -- I. A novel modelling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to modelling the nebular emission from star-forming galaxies by combining the contributions from many HII regions incorporating loose trends in physical properties, random dust attenuation, a predefined Halpha luminosity function and a diffuse ionized-gas component. Using a machine-learning-based regression artificial neural network trained on a grid of models generated by the photoionization code Cloudy, we efficiently predict emission-line properties of individual HII regions over a wide range of physical conditions. We generate 250,000 synthetic star-forming galaxies composed of up to 3000 HII regions and explore how variations in parameters affect their integrated emission-line properties. Our results highlight systematic biases in oxygen-abundance estimates derived using traditional methods, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the composite nature of star-forming galaxies when interpreting integrated nebular emission. Future work will leverage this approach to explore in detail its impact on parameter estimates of star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Impact of accretion-induced chemically homogeneous evolution on stellar and compact binary populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In binary star systems, mass transfer can spin up the accretor, possibly leading to efficient chemical mixing and chemically quasi-homogeneous evolution (CHE). Here, we explore the effects of accretion-induced CHE on both stellar populations and their compact binary remnants with the state-of-the-art population synthesis code SEVN. We find that CHE efficiently enhances the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) from secondary stars, which are spun-up by accretion, while simultaneously preventing their evolution into red supergiant stars (RSGs). Including CHE in our models increases the fraction of WRs in our stellar sample by nearly a factor of $\approx3$ at low metallicity ($Z=0.001$). WRs formed through CHE are, on average, more massive and luminous than those formed without CHE. Most WRs formed via CHE end their life as black holes. As a direct consequence, the CHE mechanism enhances the formation of binary black holes (BBHs) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) systems, while simultaneously quenching the production of binary neutron stars (BNSs). However, CHE significantly quenches the merger rate of BBHs, BHNSs and BNSs at low metallicity ($Z\leq{}0.004$), because most binary compact objects formed via CHE have large orbital periods. For instance, the number of BBH and BHNS mergers decreases by one order of magnitude at $Z=0.004$ in the CHE model compared to the standard scenario. Finally, we find that secondary stars experiencing CHE frequently produce the most massive compact object in the binary system. In BHNSs, this implies that the black hole progenitor is the secondary star. Conversely, BBHs formed through accretion-induced CHE likely have asymmetric black hole components, but only a negligible fraction of these asymmetric systems ultimately merge within an Hubble time.</description>

      <title>Parallactic delay for geodetic VLBI and non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia optical astrometric mission has measured the precise positions of millions of objects in the sky, including extragalactic sources also observed by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the recent Gaia EDR3 release, an effect of negative parallax with a magnitude of approximately -17 $\mu$as was reported, presumably due to technical reasons related to the relativistic delay model. A recent analysis of a 30-year set of geodetic VLBI data revealed a similar negative parallax with an amplitude of $-15.8 \pm 0.5$ $ \mu$as. Since both astrometric techniques, optical and radio, provide consistent estimates of this negative parallax, it is necessary to investigate the potential origin of this effect. We developed the extended group relativistic delay model to incorporate the additional parallactic effect for radio sources at distances less than 1 Mpc and found that the apparent annual signal might appear due the non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes, which are defined by the positions of the reference radio sources themselves. Unlike the conventional parallactic ellipse, the apparent annual effect in this case appears as a circular motion for all objects independently of their ecliptic latitude. The measured amplitude of this circular effect is within a range of 10-15 $\mu$as that is consistent with the ICRF3 stability of the fundamental axis. This annual circular effect could also arise if a G\"odel-type cosmological metric were applied, suggesting that, in the future, this phenomenon could be used to indicate global cosmic rotation.</description>

      <title>The Progenitor Systems of Classical Novae in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first characterization of the statistical relationship between a large sample of novae in M31 and their progenitor stellar populations in the form of a delay time distribution. To this end, we leverage the spatially resolved stellar age distribution of the M31 disk derived from deep HST photometry by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and a large catalog of novae in M31. Our delay time distribution has two statistically significant detections: one population of nova progenitors, ages between 2 and 3.2 Gyr, with an unnormalized rate of ($3.7^{+6.8}_{-3.5} \pm 2.1) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$, and another of ages between 7.9 Gyr and the age of the Universe with ($4.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \pm 0.2) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$ (uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively). Together with the upper limits we derive at other time bins, these detections are consistent with either a constant production efficiency or a higher production efficiency of novae at earlier delay times.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae of the Large Magellanic Cloud II: the connection with the progenitors' properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of planetary nebulae (PNe) offers the opportunity of evaluating the efficiency of the dust production mechanism during the very late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. We study the relationship between the properties of PNe, particularly the gas and dust content, with the mass and metallicity of the progenitor stars, to understand how dust production works in the late AGB phases, and to shed new light on the physical processes occurring to the stars and the material in their surroundings since the departure from the AGB until the PN phase. We consider a sample of 9 PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 7 out of which characterized by the presence of carbonaceous dust, the remaining 2 with silicates. For these stars the masses and the metallicity of the progenitor stars were estimated. We combine results from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling with those coming from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution, to find the relation between the dust and gas mass of the PNe considered and the The physical properties of carbon-rich PNe are influenced by the mass of the progenitor star. Specifically, the dust-to-gas ratio in the nebula increases from 5x10^{-4}to 6x10^{-3} as the progenitor star's mass increases from approximately 0.9Msun to 2Msun. This change is partly influenced by the effective temperature of the PNe, and it occurs because higher-mass carbon stars are more efficient at producing dust. Consequently, as the progenitor's mass increases, the gas mass of the PNe decreases, since the larger amounts of dust lead to greater effects from radiation pressure, which pushes the gas outwards. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn by the study of the PNe with silicate-type dust, because the sub-sample is made up of 2 PNe only, one of which is almost dust-free.</description>

      <title>Impact of photoevaporative winds in chemical models of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions, where protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby massive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated sources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to probe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting this data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these disks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched by external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we post-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with and without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that UV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal re-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating, increasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line fluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily due to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within the disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly influences the physical and chemical structure, and observational characteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating the wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical abundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet formation in these common yet complex environments.</description>

      <title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: Survey Overview and Public Data Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CO(1-0) line has been carefully calibrated as a tracer of molecular gas mass. However, recent studies often favor higher J transitions of the CO molecule which are brighter and accessible for redshift ranges where CO(1-0) is not. These lines are not perfect analogues for CO(1-0), owing to their more stringent excitation conditions, and must be calibrated for use as molecular gas tracers. Here we introduce the Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT (AMISS), a multi-CO line survey of z~0 galaxies conducted to calibrate the CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) lines. The final survey includes CO(2-1) spectra of 176 galaxies and CO(3-2) spectra for a subset of 45. We supplement these with archival CO(1-0) spectra from xCOLD GASS for all sources and additional CO(1-0) observations with the Kitt Peak 12m Telescope. Targets were selected to be representative of the galaxy population in the stellar mass range of $10^9$ to $10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$. Our project emphasized careful characterization of statistical and systematic uncertainties to enable studies of trends in CO line ratios. We show that optical and CO disk sizes are on average equal, for both the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) line. We measure the distribution of CO line luminosity ratios, finding medians (16th-84th percentile) of 0.71 (0.51-0.96) for the CO(2-1)-to-CO(1-0) ratio, 0.39 (0.24-0.53) for the CO(3-2)-to-CO(1-0) ratio, and 0.53 (0.41-0.74) for the CO(3-2)-to-CO(2-1) ratio. A companion paper presents our study of CO(2-1)'s applicability as a molecular gas mass tracer and search for trends in the CO(2-1)-to-CO(1-0) ratio. Our catalog of CO line luminosities will be publicly available with the published version of this article.</description>

      <title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: Variations in the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) Line Ratio Across the Galaxy Population</title>

Abstract: The J=1$\rightarrow$0 spectral line of carbon monoxide (CO(1-0)) is the canonical tracer of molecular gas. However, CO(2-1) is frequently used in its place, following the assumption that the higher energy line can be used to infer the CO(1-0) luminosity and molecular gas mass. The use of CO(2-1) depends on a knowledge of the ratio between CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) luminosities, r21. Here we present galaxy-integrated r21 measurements for 122 galaxies spanning stellar masses from 10$^9$ to 10$^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$ and star formation rates (SFRs) from 0.08 to 35 M$_\odot$/yr. We find strong trends between r21 and SFR, SFR surface density, star formation efficiency, and distance from the star formation main sequence (SFMS). We show that the assumption of a constant r21 can introduce biases into the molecular gas trends in galaxy population studies and demonstrate how this affects the recovery of important galaxy scaling relations, including the Kennicutt-Schmidt law and the relation between SFMS offset and star formation efficiency. We provide a prescription which accounts for variations in r21 as a function of SFR and can be used to convert between CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) when only one line is available. Our prescription matches variations in r21 for both AMISS and literature samples and can be used to derive more accurate gas masses from CO(2-1) observations.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ feedback prevails at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the first galaxies, stars, and star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation pressure from Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) scattering is a potentially dominant form of early stellar feedback, capable of injecting up to $\sim 100 \, \times$ more momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) than UV continuum radiation pressure and stellar winds. Ly$\alpha$ feedback is particularly strong in dust-poor environments and is thus especially important during the formation of the first stars and galaxies. As upcoming galaxy formation simulations incorporate Ly$\alpha$ feedback, it is crucial to consider processes that can limit it to avoid placing $\Lambda$CDM in apparent tension with recent \textit{JWST} observations indicating efficient star formation at Cosmic Dawn. We study Ly$\alpha$ feedback using a novel analytical Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer solution that includes the effects of continuum absorption, gas velocity gradients, Ly$\alpha$ destruction (e.g. by $2p \rightarrow 2s$ transitions), ISM turbulence, and atomic recoil. We verify our solution for uniform clouds using extensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) tests, and resolve a previous discrepancy between analytical and MCRT predictions. We then study the sensitivity of Ly$\alpha$ feedback to the aforementioned effects. While these can dampen Ly$\alpha$ feedback by a factor $\lesssim \textrm{few} \times 10$, we find it remains $\gtrsim 5 - 100 \, \times$ stronger than direct radiation pressure and therefore cannot be neglected. We provide an accurate fit for the Ly$\alpha$ force multiplier $M_{\rm F}$, suitable for implementation in subgrid models for galaxy formation simulations. Our findings highlight the critical role of Ly$\alpha$ feedback in regulating star formation at Cosmic Dawn, and underscore the necessity of incorporating it into simulations to accurately model early galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Investigations of MWISP Filaments. I. Filament Identification and Analysis Algorithms, and Source Catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filaments play a crucial role in providing the necessary environmental conditions for star formation, actively participating in the process. To facilitate the identification and analysis of filaments, we introduce DPConCFil (Directional and Positional Consistency between Clumps and Filaments), a suite of algorithms comprising one identification method and two analysis methods. The first method, the consistency-based identification approach, uses directional and positional consistency among neighboring clumps and local filament axes to identify filaments in the PPV datacube. The second method employs a graph-based skeletonization technique to extract the filament intensity skeletons. The third method, a graph-based substructuring approach, allows the decomposition of complex filaments into simpler sub-filaments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPConCFil by applying the identification method to the clumps detected in the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey dataset by FacetClumps, successfully identifying a batch of filaments across various scales within $10^{\circ} \leq l \leq 20^{\circ}$, $-5.25^{\circ} \leq b \leq 5.25^{\circ}$ and -200 km s$^{-1}$ $\leq v \leq$ 200 km s$^{-1}$. Subsequently, we apply the analysis methods to the identified filaments, presenting a catalog with basic parameters and conducting statistics of their galactic distribution and properties. DPConCFil is openly available on GitHub, accompanied by a manual.</description>

      <title>In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence Through Dyson Sphere-like structures around Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will be followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as the space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes (PBHs) as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson sphere-like structures around PBHs in the Milky Way and other galaxies.</description>

      <title>MUSEQuBES: Unveiling Cosmic Web Filaments at $z\approx3.6$ through Dual Absorption and Emission Line Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to modern cosmological models, galaxies are embedded within cosmic filaments, which supply a continuous flow of pristine gas, fueling star formation and driving their evolution. However, due to their low density, the direct detection of diffuse gas in cosmic filaments remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely metal-poor ($[ X/H] \approx -3.7$), low-density ($\log_{10} n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}} \approx -4$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\approx 5$) partial Lyman limit system (pLLS) at $z\approx3.577$ along the quasar sightline Q1317--0507, probing cosmic filaments. Additionally, two other low-metallicity (\met$\lesssim -2$) absorption systems are detected at similar redshifts, one of which is also a pLLS. VLT/MUSE observations reveal a significant overdensity of \lya\ emitters (LAEs) associated with these absorbers. The spatial distribution of the LAEs strongly suggests the presence of an underlying filamentary structure. This is further supported by the detection of a large \lya\ emitting nebula with a surface brightness of $\geq 10^{-19}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~arcsec^{-2}$, with a maximum projected linear size of $\approx 260$~pkpc extending along the LAEs. This is the first detection of giant \lya\ emission tracing cosmic filaments, linked to normal galaxies and likely powered by in-situ recombination.</description>

      <title>A Large Molecular Gas Reservoir in the Protocluster SPT2349$-$56 at $z\,{=}\,4.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Atacama Compact Array (ACA) Band-3 observations of the protocluster SPT2349$-$56, an extreme system hosting ${\gtrsim}\,12$ submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\,{=}\,4.3$, to study its integrated molecular gas content via CO(4-3) and long-wavelength dust continuum. The $\sim$30-hour integration represents one of the longest exposures yet taken on a single pointing with the ACA 7-m. The low-resolution ACA data ($21.0''\,{\times}\,12.2''$) reveal a 75% excess CO(4-3) flux compared to the sum of individual sources detected in higher-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data ($1.0''\,{\times}\,0.8''$). Our work also reveals a similar result by tapering the ALMA data to $10''$. In contrast, the 3.2mm dust continuum shows little discrepancy between ACA and ALMA. A single-dish [CII] spectrum obtained by APEX/FLASH supports the ACA CO(4-3) result, revealing a large excess in [CII] emission relative to ALMA. The missing flux is unlikely due to undetected faint sources but instead suggests that high-resolution ALMA observations might miss extended and low-surface-brightness gas. Such emission could originate from the circum-galactic medium (CGM) or the pre-heated proto-intracluster medium (proto-ICM). If this molecular gas reservoir replenishes the star formation fuel, the overall depletion timescale will exceed 400Myr, reducing the requirement for the simultaneous SMG activity in SPT2349$-$56. Our results highlight the role of an extended gas reservoir in sustaining a high star formation rate (SFR) in SPT2349$-$56, and potentially establishing the ICM during the transition phase to a mature cluster.</description>

      <title>An intriguing coincidence between the majority of vast polar structure dwarfs and a recent major merger at the M31 position</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.</description>

      <title>Abundant Water from Early Supernovae at Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial (or Pop III) supernovae were the first nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the heavy elements required for the later formation of planets and life. Water, in particular, is thought to be crucial to the cosmic origins of life as we understand it, and recent models have shown that water can form in low-metallicity gas like that present at high redshifts. Here we present numerical simulations that show that the first water in the Universe formed in Pop III core-collapse and pair-instability supernovae at redshifts $z \sim$ 20. The primary sites of water production in these remnants are dense molecular cloud cores, which in some cases were enriched with primordial water to mass fractions that were only a factor of a few below those in the Solar System today. These dense, dusty cores are also likely candidates for protoplanetary disk formation. Besides revealing that a primary ingredient for life was already in place in the Universe 100 - 200 Myr after the Big Bang, our simulations show that water was likely a key constituent of the first galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources is presented. The low-energy asymptotic regime is extracted, requiring a self-consistent coupling of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The Raychaudhuri equation reduces to a balance equation, with two important limits. These limits can be interpreted empirically for rotationally supported configurations such as galaxies. The net energy including quasilocal kinetic contributions vanishes on the inner vortex surface, and the outer rotosurface. These new geometrical objects potentially shed light on virialization. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support previous suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the response of dark matter halo to galaxy evolution in IllustrisTNG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the dynamical evolution of the dark matter's relaxation response to galaxies and their connection to the astrophysical properties as simulated in the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that the radially-dependent linear relaxation relation model from our previous work is applicable at least from redshift $z=5$. We focus on the offset parameter $q_0$, which characterizes the relaxation of dark matter shells without changing the enclosed mass. We perform multiple time-series analyses to determine the possible causal connections between the relaxation mechanism and astrophysical processes such as star formation and associated feedback processes, as well as feedback due to active galactic nuclei. We show that star formation activity significantly influences the halo relaxation response throughout its evolutionary history, with essentially immediate effects in the inner haloes and delayed effects of 2 to 3 Gyr in the outer regions. Metal content shows a weaker connection to relaxation than star formation rates, but the accumulated wind from feedback processes exhibits a stronger correlation. These findings enhance our understanding of halo relaxation mechanisms. Our estimates of the time-scales relevant for dark matter relaxation can potentially improve the description of halo profiles in existing baryonification schemes and semi-analytical galaxy formation models. Our results also show how the relaxation response of dark haloes can probe the evolutionary history of the galaxies they host.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies. The demonstration that general relativity possesses a new alternative low-energy limit different from the conventional post-Newtonian limit may have major consequences for all gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Features and prospects for kilonova remnant detection with current and future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the observable spectral and temporal properties of kilonova remnants (KNRs) analytically, and point out quantitative differences with respect to supernova remnants. We provide detection prospects of KNRs in the context of ongoing radio surveys. We find that there is a good chance to expect tens of these objects in future surveys with a flux threshold of $\sim 0.1$ mJy. Kilonova remnants from a postulated population of long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants of neutron star mergers are even more likely to be detected, as they are extremely bright and peak earlier. For an ongoing survey with a threshold of $\sim$ 1 mJy, we expect to find tens to hundreds of such objects if they are a significant fraction of the total kilonova (KN) population. Considering that there are no such promising KN candidates in presently ongoing surveys, we constrain the fraction of these extreme KN to be no more than 30 percent of the overall KN population. This constraint depends sensitively on the details of ejecta mass and external density distribution.</description>

Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01777</link>

Abstract: Classical Cepheids are a cornerstone class of pulsators, fundamental to testing stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Their secular period changes, characterized through $O-C$ (Observed minus Calculated) diagrams, offer valuable insights into their evolution. While evolutionary period changes are well understood from both observational and theoretical perspectives, shorter timescale period changes (on the order of ($\sim$ 10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$ days) - known as non-evolutionary period changes are yet to be systematically explored.
  In this work, we present a detailed and comprehensive search for non-evolutionary period changes using $O-C$ analysis of Magellanic Cloud (MC) Cepheids, based on 20+ years of OGLE photometry data. Our sample includes both the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Cepheids, focusing on single radial mode Cepheids (both fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) modes). The results are grouped into two phenomena: (a) Cepheids in binary systems (b) Non-linear period changes.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations around the Schwarzschild-MOG black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the motion of massive particles in the gravitational field of a modified gravity (MOG) black hole (BH), characterized by the parameter $\alpha$. Using the Hamiltonian formalism, the geodesic equations and the effective potential governing particle trajectories are derived. Key features, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the innermost bound circular orbit (IBCO), are analyzed, revealing their dependence on the particle's energy, angular momentum, and the MOG parameter. In the extremal case, where $\alpha=-1$, the event horizon merges with the Cauchy horizon, forming a distinctive BH configuration. Numerical methods are employed to compute periodic orbits in this spacetime, with a comparison drawn to the Schwarzschild BH. The findings indicate that for $\alpha&gt;0$, periodic orbits around Schwarzschild-MOG BH exhibit lower energy requirements than those in Schwarzschild spacetime, whereas for $-1&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, the energy requirements are higher. Precessing orbits near periodic trajectories are also examined, offering insights into their complex dynamical behavior. Finally, the gravitational wave (GW) radiation from the periodic orbits of a test particle around the Schwarzschild-MOG BH is examined, generating intricate waveforms that provide insights into the gravitational structure of the system.</description>
