      <title>Bunting and the ghost runner: a causal inference approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the home team bunting in extra innings of Major League Baseball games when the game is tied in the bottom of the inning. Using methods rooted in causal inference, we show that teams choose not to bunt when the statistical evidence clearly suggests it is in their advantage to do so. The reluctance to bunt in this situation is likely tied to the general decline in bunting, which is considered less effective than swinging away in most situations. In the 2021-22 seasons, the home team's first batter bunted in only 21% of tied extra innings. When they bunted, the home team went on to win the game in 74% of those innings, compared to 57% when they swung away (i.e. did not bunt), for an odds ratio for winning comparing bunting to swinging away of 2.13 (95% C.I.: 1.13, 4.30). However, the bunters had more experience bunting and the nonbunters were stronger hitters, thus the odds ratio above is a confounded estimate of the effect of bunting. Using inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding, we estimate an odds ratio of 1.86 (95% C.I. 1.07, 3.27). This means that a typical team would expect to win 2 more games each season if they bunted in such situations which is worth millions in player salary.</description>

      <title>Binary Trees and Taxicab Correspondence Analysis of Extremely Sparse Binary Textual Data: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a case study, where Taxicab Correspondence Analysis reveals that the underlying structure of an extremely sparse binary textual data set can be represented by a binary tree, where the nodes representing clusters of words can be interpreted as topics. The textual data set represents Israel's Declaration of Independence text and 40 diverse Israeli Interviewees. The analysis provides for a compare and contrast study of textual data coming from two different sources. Furthermore, we propose an adjusted sparsity index which takes into account the size of the data table.</description>

      <title>Why is soccer so popular: Understanding underdog achievement and randomness in team ball sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine team ball sports to investigate how the likelihood of weaker teams winning against stronger ones, referred to as underdog achievement, is influenced by inherent randomness factors that affect match outcomes in such sports. To address our research question, we collected data on match scores and computed corresponding team rankings from major international competitions for 12 popular team ball sports: basketball, cricket, field hockey, futsal, handball, ice hockey, lacrosse, roller hockey, rugby, soccer, volleyball, and water polo. Then, we developed an underdog achievement score to identify the sports with the highest occurrences of weaker teams prevailing over stronger ones, and we designed a randomness model consisting of factors that contribute to unexpected match outcomes within each sport. Our findings indicate that soccer is among the sports in which a weaker team is most likely to win. Through principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis, we demonstrate that our randomness model can explain such a phenomenon, showing that the underdog achievement can be attributed to numerous factors that can randomly influence match outcomes.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Consumer Purchase Journey Using Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes an ensemble of feedforward neural network models to analyze large-volume and high-dimensional consumer touchpoints and their impact on purchase decisions. When applied to a proprietary dataset of consumer touchpoints and purchases from a global software service provider, the proposed approach demonstrates better predictive accuracy than both traditional models, such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors, as well as ensemble tree-based classifiers, such as bagging, random forest, AdaBoost, and gradient boosting. By calculating the Shapley values within this network, we provide nuanced insights into touchpoint effectiveness, as we not only assess the marginal impact of diverse touchpoint types but also offer a granular view of the impact distribution within a touchpoint type. Additionally, our model shows excellent adaptability and resilience with limited data resources. When the historical data is reduced from 40 to 1 month, our model shows only a modest 19% decrease in accuracy. This modeling framework can enable managers to more accurately and comprehensively evaluate consumer touchpoints, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of their marketing campaigns.</description>

      <title>Topological Feature Search Method for Multichannel EEG: Application in ADHD classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the preliminary diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using electroencephalography (EEG) has garnered attention from researchers. EEG, known for its expediency and efficiency, plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. However, the non-stationarity of EEG signals and inter-subject variability pose challenges to the diagnostic and classification processes. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a novel perspective for ADHD classification, diverging from traditional time-frequency domain features. Yet, conventional TDA models are restricted to single-channel time series and are susceptible to noise, leading to the loss of topological features in persistence diagrams.This paper presents an enhanced TDA approach applicable to multi-channel EEG in ADHD. Initially, optimal input parameters for multi-channel EEG are determined. Subsequently, each channel's EEG undergoes phase space reconstruction (PSR) followed by the utilization of k-Power Distance to Measure (k-PDTM) for approximating ideal point clouds. Then, multi-dimensional time series are re-embedded, and TDA is applied to obtain topological feature information. Gaussian function-based Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation (MKDE) is employed in the merger persistence diagram to filter out desired topological feature mappings. Finally, persistence image (PI) method is utilized to extract topological features, and the influence of various weighting functions on the results is discussed.The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using the IEEE ADHD dataset. Results demonstrate that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach 85.60%, 83.61%, and 88.33%, respectively. Compared to traditional TDA methods, our method was effectively improved and outperforms typical nonlinear descriptors. These findings indicate that our method exhibits higher precision and robustness.</description>

      <title>A Copula Graphical Model for Multi-Attribute Data using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by modern data forms such as images and multi-view data, the multi-attribute graphical model aims to explore the conditional independence structure among vectors. Under the Gaussian assumption, the conditional independence between vectors is characterized by blockwise zeros in the precision matrix. To relax the restrictive Gaussian assumption, in this paper, we introduce a novel semiparametric multi-attribute graphical model based on a new copula named Cyclically Monotone Copula. This new copula treats the distribution of the node vectors as multivariate marginals and transforms them into Gaussian distributions based on the optimal transport theory. Since the model allows the node vectors to have arbitrary continuous distributions, it is more flexible than the classical Gaussian copula method that performs coordinatewise Gaussianization. We establish the concentration inequalities of the estimated covariance matrices and provide sufficient conditions for selection consistency of the group graphical lasso estimator. For the setting with high-dimensional attributes, a {Projected Cyclically Monotone Copula} model is proposed to address the curse of dimensionality issue that arises from solving high-dimensional optimal transport problems. Numerical results based on synthetic and real data show the efficiency and flexibility of our methods.</description>

      <title>Multiple imputation for longitudinal data: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal studies are frequently used in medical research and involve collecting repeated measures on individuals over time. Observations from the same individual are invariably correlated and thus an analytic approach that accounts for this clustering by individual is required. While almost all research suffers from missing data, this can be particularly problematic in longitudinal studies as participation often becomes harder to maintain over time. Multiple imputation (MI) is widely used to handle missing data in such studies. When using MI, it is important that the imputation model is compatible with the proposed analysis model. In a longitudinal analysis, this implies that the clustering considered in the analysis model should be reflected in the imputation process. Several MI approaches have been proposed to impute incomplete longitudinal data, such as treating repeated measurements of the same variable as distinct variables or using generalized linear mixed imputation models. However, the uptake of these methods has been limited, as they require additional data manipulation and use of advanced imputation procedures. In this tutorial, we review the available MI approaches that can be used for handling incomplete longitudinal data, including where individuals are clustered within higher-level clusters. We illustrate implementation with replicable R and Stata code using a case study from the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study.</description>

      <title>Optimal day-ahead offering strategy for large producers based on market price response learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In day-ahead electricity markets based on uniform marginal pricing, small variations in the offering and bidding curves may substantially modify the resulting market outcomes. In this work, we deal with the problem of finding the optimal offering curve for a risk-averse profit-maximizing generating company (GENCO) in a data-driven context. In particular, a large GENCO's market share may imply that her offering strategy can alter the marginal price formation, which can be used to increase profit. We tackle this problem from a novel perspective. First, we propose a optimization-based methodology to summarize each GENCO's step-wise supply curves into a subset of representative price-energy blocks. Then, the relationship between the market price and the resulting energy block offering prices is modeled through a Bayesian linear regression approach, which also allows us to generate stochastic scenarios for the sensibility of the market towards the GENCO strategy, represented by the regression coefficient probabilistic distributions. Finally, this predictive model is embedded in the stochastic optimization model by employing a constraint learning approach. Results show how allowing the GENCO to deviate from her true marginal costs renders significant changes in her profits and the market marginal price. Furthermore, these results have also been tested in an out-of-sample validation setting, showing how this optimal offering strategy is also effective in a real-world market contest.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between predictive performance and FDR control for high-dimensional Gaussian model selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the high-dimensional Gaussian linear regression for ordered variables, we study the variable selection procedure via the minimization of the penalized least-squares criterion. We focus on model selection where the penalty function depends on an unknown multiplicative constant commonly calibrated for prediction. We propose a new proper calibration of this hyperparameter to simultaneously control predictive risk and false discovery rate. We obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the False Discovery Rate with respect to the hyperparameter and we provide an algorithm to calibrate it. This algorithm is based on quantities that can typically be observed in real data applications. The algorithm is validated in an extensive simulation study and is compared with some existing variable selection procedures. Finally, we study an extension of our approach to the case in which an ordering of the variables is not available.</description>

      <title>Random matching in balanced bipartite graphs: The (un)fairness of draw mechanisms used in sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The draw of some knockout tournaments requires finding a perfect matching in a balanced bipartite graph. The problem becomes challenging if there are draw constraints: the two field-proven procedures used in sports are known to be non-uniformly distributed, which may threaten fairness. Therefore, we compare the biases of both mechanisms, each of them having two forms, for reasonable subsets of balanced bipartite graphs up to 16 nodes. The UEFA Champions League Round of 16 draw is verified to apply the best design among the four available options. However, considerable scope remains to improve the performance of the known randomisation procedures.</description>

      <title>A physics and data co-driven surrogate modeling method for high-dimensional rare event simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics and data co-driven surrogate modeling method for efficient rare event simulation of civil and mechanical systems with high-dimensional input uncertainties. The method fuses interpretable low-fidelity physical models with data-driven error corrections. The hypothesis is that a well-designed and well-trained simplified physical model can preserve salient features of the original model, while data-fitting techniques can fill the remaining gaps between the surrogate and original model predictions. The coupled physics-data-driven surrogate model is adaptively trained using active learning, aiming to achieve a high correlation and small bias between the surrogate and original model responses in the critical parametric region of a rare event. A final importance sampling step is introduced to correct the surrogate model-based probability estimations. Static and dynamic problems with input uncertainties modeled by random field and stochastic process are studied to demonstrate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport Divergences induced by Scoring Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ scoring functions, used in statistics for eliciting risk functionals, as cost functions in the Monge-Kantorovich (MK) optimal transport problem. This gives raise to a rich variety of novel asymmetric MK divergences, which subsume the family of Bregman-Wasserstein divergences. We show that for distributions on the real line, the comonotonic coupling is optimal for the majority of the new divergences. Specifically, we derive the optimal coupling of the MK divergences induced by functionals including the mean, generalised quantiles, expectiles, and shortfall measures. Furthermore, we show that while any elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measure gives raise to infinitely many MK divergences, the comonotonic coupling is simultaneously optimal.
  The novel MK divergences, which can be efficiently calculated, open an array of applications in robust stochastic optimisation. We derive sharp bounds on distortion risk measures under a Bregman-Wasserstein divergence constraint, and solve for cost-efficient payoffs under benchmark constraints.</description>
