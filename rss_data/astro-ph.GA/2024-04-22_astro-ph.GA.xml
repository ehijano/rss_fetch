      <title>The JWST-SUSPENSE Ultradeep Spectroscopic Program: Survey Overview and Star-Formation Histories of Quiescent Galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates ($z=1-3$, $H_{AB}&lt;23$), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at $z=1-4$. With 16hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (log$M_*/M_{\odot}\sim10.3-11.5$) and detailed star-formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages ($0.8-3.0$Gyr) and star formation timescales ($\sim0.5-4$Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by $z=3$. On average, the $z&gt;1.75$ $[z&lt;1.75]$ galaxies formed 50% of their stellar mass before $z=4$ $[z=3]$. Furthermore, the typical SFHs of galaxies in these two redshift bins ($z_{\text{mean}}=2.2$ and $z_{\text{mean}}=1.3$) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star-formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, we cannot rule out that mergers and late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances,</description>

      <title>Characterising Tidal Features Around Galaxies in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal features provide signatures of recent mergers and offer a unique insight into the assembly history of galaxies. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will enable an unprecedentedly large survey of tidal features around millions of galaxies. To decipher the contributions of mergers to galaxy evolution it will be necessary to compare the observed tidal features with theoretical predictions. Therefore, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations NewHorizon, EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Magneticum to produce LSST-like mock images of $z\sim0$ galaxies ($z\sim0.2$ for NewHorizon) with $M_{\scriptstyle\star,\text{ 30 pkpc}}\geq10^{9.5}$ M$_{\scriptstyle\odot}$. We perform a visual classification to identify tidal features and classify their morphology. We find broadly good agreement between the simulations regarding their overall tidal feature fractions: $f_{\text{NewHorizon}}=0.40\pm0.06$, $f_{\text{EAGLE}}=0.37\pm0.01$, $f_{\text{TNG}}=0.32\pm0.01$ and $f_{\text{Magneticum}}=0.32\pm0.01$, and their specific tidal feature fractions. Furthermore, we find excellent agreement regarding the trends of tidal feature fraction with stellar and halo mass. All simulations agree in predicting that the majority of central galaxies of groups and clusters exhibit at least one tidal feature, while the satellite members rarely show such features. This agreement suggests that gravity is the primary driver of the occurrence of visually-identifiable tidal features in cosmological simulations, rather than subgrid physics or hydrodynamics. All predictions can be verified directly with LSST observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase black-hole feedback and a bright [CII] halo in a Lo-BAL quasar at $z\sim6.6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the mass growth of supermassive black holes during the Epoch of Reionisation is expected to play a role in shaping the concurrent growth of their host-galaxies, observational evidence of feedback at z$\gtrsim$6 is still sparse. We perform the first multi-scale and multi-phase characterisation of black-hole driven outflows in the $z\sim6.6$ quasar J0923+0402 and assess how these winds impact the cold gas reservoir. We employ the SimBAL spectral synthesis to fit broad absorption line (BAL) features and find a powerful ionized outflow on $\lesssim210$ pc scale, with a kinetic power $\sim2-100$\% of the quasar luminosity. ALMA observations of [CII] emission allow us to study the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas. We detect high-velocity [CII] emission, likely associated with a cold neutral outflow at $\sim0.5-2$ kpc scale in the host-galaxy, and a bright extended [CII] halo with a size of $\sim15$ kpc. For the first time at such an early epoch, we accurately constrain the outflow energetics in both the ionized and the atomic neutral gas phases. We find such energetics to be consistent with expectations for an efficient feedback mechanism, and both ejective and preventative feedback modes are likely at play. The scales and energetics of the ionized and atomic outflows suggest that they might be associated with different quasar accretion episodes. The results of this work indicate that strong black hole feedback is occurring in quasars at $z\gtrsim6$ and is likely responsible for shaping the properties of the cold gas reservoir up to circum-galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Probing the relationship between early star formation and CO in the dwarf irregular galaxy WLM with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) is a Local Group dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxy with a metallicity 13% of solar. At 1 Mpc, the relative isolation of WLM provides a unique opportunity to investigate the internal mechanisms of star formation at low metallicities. The earliest stages of star formation in larger spirals occur in embedded clusters within molecular clouds, but dIrrs lack the dust, heavy metals, and organized structure of spirals believed necessary to collapse the molecular clouds into stars. Despite actively forming stars, the early stages of star formation in dIrrs is not well understood. We examine the relationship between early star formation and molecular clouds at low metallicities. We utilize ALMA-detected CO cores, $\textit{JWST}$ near-infrared (NIR) images (F090W, F150W, F250M, and F430M), and $\textit{GALEX}$ far-ultraviolet (FUV) images of WLM to trace molecular clouds, early star formation, and longer star formation timescales respectively. We compare clumps of NIR-bright sources (referred to as objects) categorized into three types based on their proximity to FUV sources and CO cores. We find objects, independent of their location, have similar colors and magnitudes and no discernible difference in temperature. However, we find that objects near CO have higher masses than objects away from CO, independent of proximity to FUV. Additionally, objects near CO are coincident with Spitzer 8 $\mu$m sources at a higher frequency than objects elsewhere in WLM. This suggests objects near CO may be embedded star clusters at an earlier stage of star formation, but accurate age estimates for all objects are required for confirmation.</description>

      <title>The longevity of the oldest open clusters: Structural parameters of NGC 188, NGC 2420, NGC 2425, NGC 2682, NGC 6791, NGC 6819</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Open clusters' dynamical evolution is driven by stellar evolution, internal dynamics and external forces, which according to dynamical simulations, will evaporate them in a timescale of about 1 Ga. However, about 10\% of the known open clusters are older. They are special systems whose detailed properties are related to their dynamical evolution and the balance between mechanisms of cluster formation and dissolution. Aims:We investigate the spatial distribution and structural parameters of six open clusters older than 1 Ga in order to constrain their dynamical evolution, and longevity.} Methods: We identify members using Gaia EDR3 data up to a distance of 150 pc from each cluster's centre. We investigate the spatial distribution of stars inside each cluster to understand their degree of mass segregation. Finally, in order to interpret the obtained radial density profiles we reproduced them using the lowered isothermal model explorer with PYTHON Limepy and spherical potential escapers stitched SPES. Results: All the studied clusters seem more extended than previously reported in the literature. The spatial distributions of three of them show some structures aligned with their orbits. They may be related to the existence of extra tidal stars. In fact, we find that about 20 % of their members have enough energy to leave the systems or are already unbound. Together with their initial masses, their distances to the Galactic plane may play significant roles in their survival. We found clear evidences that the most dynamically evolved clusters do not fill their Roche volumes, appearing more concentrated than the others. Finally, we find a cusp-core dichotomy in the central regions of the studied clusters, which shows some similarities to the one observed among globular clusters.</description>

      <title>AstroSat observations of interacting galaxies NGC 7469 and IC 5283</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used AstroSat's Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to obtain NUV and FUV images of NGC~7469 in various filters. We have carried out photometry of star-forming regions in the two galaxies and obtained their distribution. We have obtained the distributions of star formation rates (SFR) in NGC 7469 and IC 5283 using the estimates obtained from the FUV and NUV bands and carried out Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to look for differences in the SFRs in the two galaxies. We have derived the spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to the determination of physical parameters, including overall SFR, stellar mass ($\text{M}_{*}$), dust mass ($\text{M}_\text{Dust}$), and specific star formation rates in both the galaxies. Our NUV and FUV images show the presence of an outer spiral arm which is better resolved. We have identified 33 new star-forming regions out of 51 total identified in the UVIT composite image. Enhanced star formation activity is observed coinciding with the interaction, and KS tests show that there are no significant differences in the SFR distributions of NGC 7469 and IC 5283 indicating that the interaction between the galaxies has not influenced their star formation processes differently. The SED plots and the photometric results show that most of the star formation activity is confined inside the central starburst (SB) ring.</description>

      <title>MAUVE: A 6 kpc bipolar outflow launched from NGC 4383, one of the most HI-rich galaxies in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar feedback-driven outflows are important regulators of the gas-star formation cycle. However, resolving outflow physics requires high resolution observations that can only be achieved in very nearby galaxies, making suitable targets rare. We present the first results from the new VLT/MUSE large program MAUVE (MUSE and ALMA Unveiling the Virgo Environment), which aims to understand the gas-star formation cycle within the context of the Virgo cluster environment. Outflows are a key part of this cycle, and we focus on the peculiar galaxy NGC 4383, which hosts a $\sim6\,$kpc bipolar outflow fuelled by one of Virgo's most HI-rich discs. The spectacular MUSE data reveal the clumpy structure and complex kinematics of the ionised gas in this M82-like outflow at 100 pc resolution. Using the ionised gas geometry and kinematics we constrain the opening half-angle to $\theta=25-35^\circ$, while the average outflow velocity is $\sim210$ kms$^{-1}$. The emission line ratios reveal an ionisation structure where photoionisation is the dominant excitation process. The outflowing gas shows a marginally elevated gas-phase oxygen abundance compared to the disc but is lower than the central starburst, highlighting the contribution of mixing between the ejected and entrained gas. Making some assumptions about the outflow geometry, we estimate an integrated mass outflow-rate of $\sim1.8~$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and a corresponding mass-loading factor in the range 1.7-2.3. NGC 4383 is a useful addition to the few nearby examples of well-resolved outflows, and will provide a useful baseline for quantifying the role of outflows within the Virgo cluster.</description>

      <title>Maser Activity of Organic Molecules toward Sgr B2(N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At centimeter wavelengths, single-dish observations have suggested that the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2 molecular cloud at the Galactic Center hosts weak maser emission from several organic molecules, including CH$_2$NH, HNCNH, and HCOOCH$_3$. However, the lack of spatial distribution information of these new maser species has prevented us from assessing the excitation conditions of the maser emission as well as their pumping mechanisms. Here, we present a mapping study toward Sgr B2 North (N) to locate the region where the complex maser emission originates. We report the first detection of the Class I methanol (CH$_3$OH) maser at 84 GHz and the first interferometric map of the methanimine (CH$_2$NH) maser at 5.29 GHz toward this region. In addition, we present a tool for modeling and fitting the unsaturated molecular maser signals with non-LTE radiative transfer models and Bayesian analysis using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach. These enable us to quantitatively assess the observed spectral profiles. The results suggest a two-chain-clump model for explaining the intense CH$_3$OH Class I maser emission toward a region with low continuum background radiation. By comparing the spatial origin and extent of maser emission from several molecular species, we find that the 5.29 GHz CH$_2$NH maser has a close spatial relationship with the 84 GHz CH$_3$OH Class I masers. This relationship serves as observational evidence to suggest a similar collisional pumping mechanism for these maser transitions.</description>

      <title>Disentangling gamma-beta: the 4th-order velocity moments based on spherical Jeans analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing a core and a cusp within dark matter halos is complexified by the existence of mass-anisotropy degeneracy, where various combinations of velocity anisotropy ($\beta$) and inner density slope ($\gamma$) yield similar observational signatures. We construct a dynamical model that incorporates the 4th-order velocity moments to alleviate this challenge. The inclusion of the 4th-order velocity moments enables stars' line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) to be flexible. This flexible LOSVD can cover from a thin-tailed to a heavy-tailed distribution that is inaccessible if only the 2nd-order moments are considered. We test our dynamical model using mock galaxies and find that a ratio of the global line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the mock galaxy to the velocity error measurement $\sigma_{\mathrm{los,global}} / \Delta v_{\mathrm{los}} \gtrsim 4$ is required to avoid obtaining systematically biased results. This bias arises from the strong dependency of the 4th-order moments on the LOSVD tails, and not even increasing the sample size to $10^4$ stars can mitigate this effect. In that velocity ratio, $\beta$ is recovered within $\sim 1 \sigma$ even when the sample size is only 500 stars, regardless of the recovery of the other parameters. However, the estimation of $\gamma$ varies, depending on the degree to which LOSVDs deviate from Gaussianity. Because of the more significant change in its LOSVDs, a cored dark halo is more likely to be identified than a cusp.</description>

      <title>SDSS J222428.53+261423.2: unique emission lines properties unveil a sub-kiloparsec dual AGN candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we presented a detailed analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectrum of a new sub-kpc scale dual AGN candidate SDSS J222428.53+261423.2 (=SDSS J2224). The target is one of the few AGNs with all the optical narrow emission lines characterized by double-peaked profiles and with peak separations in velocity units of about 930 km/s. If the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) are due to a dual AGN in \obj, the estimated physical separation between the two cores is about 500 pc. Meanwhile, three alternative explanations are also discussed in this paper, however, we can not find solid evidence to completely rule them out. Our results support the presence of a sub-kpc dual AGN with DPNELs in all lines, indicating a key episode of galaxy merging evolution at sub-kpc scale.</description>

      <title>A multigrain-multilayer astrochemical model with variable desorption energy for surface species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Interstellar surface chemistry is a complex process that occurs in icy layers accumulated onto grains of different sizes. Efficiency of surface processes often depends on the immediate environment of adsorbed molecules. Aims. We investigate how gas-grain chemistry changes when surface molecule desorption is made explicitly dependent to the molecular binding energy, which is modified, depending on the properties of the surface. Methods. Molecular binding energy changes gradually for three different environments - bare grain, where polar, water-dominated ices and non-polar, carbon monoxide-dominated ices. In addition to diffusion, evaporation and chemical desorption, photodesorption was also made binding energy-dependent, in line with experimental results. These phenomena occur in a collapsing prestellar core model that considers five grain sizes with ices arranged into four layers. Results. Efficient chemical desorption from bare grains significantly delays ice accumulation. Easier surface diffusion of molecules on non-polar ices promotes the production of carbon dioxide and other species. Conclusions. The composition of interstellar ices is regulated by several binding-energy dependent desorption mechanisms. Their actions overlap in time and space, which explains the ubiquitous proportions of major ice components (water and carbon oxides), observed to be similar in all directions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formation of Gaia BH3 in the progenitor globular cluster of the ED-2 stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The star-black hole (S-BH) binary discovered by the Gaia Collaboration - Gaia BH3 - is chemically and kinematically associated with the metal-poor ED-2 stream in the Milky Way halo.
  Aims. We explore the possibility that Gaia BH3 was assembled dynamically in the progenitor globular cluster (GC) of the ED-2 stream.
  Methods. We use a public suite of star-by-star dynamical Monte Carlo models by Kremer et al. (2020) to identify S-BH binaries in GCs with different initial masses and (half-mass) radii.
  Results. We show that a likely progenitor of the ED-2 stream was a relatively low-mass ($\lesssim10^5M_\odot$) GC with an initial half-mass radius of 2 - 4 pc. Such a GC can dynamically retain a large fraction of its BH population and dissolve on the orbit of ED-2. From the suite of models we find that GCs produce ~ 3 - 30 S-BH binaries, approximately independent of initial GC mass and inversely correlated with initial cluster radius. Scaling the results to the Milky Way GC population, we find that ~$75\%$ of the S-BH binaries formed in GCs are ejected from their host GC in the early phases of evolution ($\lesssim1$ Gyr); these are expected to no longer be close to the stream. The ~25\% of S-BH binaries retained until dissolution are expected to form part of streams, such that for an initial mass of the progenitor of ED-2 of a few $10^4M_\odot$, we expect ~2-3 S-BH to end up in the stream. GC models with metallicities similar to Gaia BH3 ($\lesssim1\%$ solar) include S-BH binaries with similar BH masses ($\gtrsim30M_\odot$), orbital periods, and eccentricities.
  Conclusions. We predict the Galactic halo contains of order $10^5$ S-BH binaries that formed dynamically in GCs, a fraction of which may readily be detected in Gaia DR4. The detection of these sources provides valuable tests of BH dynamics in clusters and the possible role in formation of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>NIRSpec View of the Appearance and Evolution of Balmer Breaks and the Transition from Bursty to Smooth Star Formation Histories from Deep Within the Epoch of Reionization to Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models and observational evidence suggest that high-redshift galaxies grow under the bursty mode of star formation, with large temporal star formation rate (SFR) fluctuations around some mean value. From an observational perspective, it has not been clear at which redshift and stellar population characteristics the transition from bursty to smooth star formation occurs. Here, we investigate these using a uniformly reduced sample of NIRSpec prism spectra of 631 galaxies at $3 &lt; z_{\rm spec} &lt; 14$, stacked in 8 redshift and 8 UV slope bins. We evaluate the burstiness of star formation histories using the Balmer break strengths as well as the ratios of SFRs as measured from the emission lines to those measured from the UV continua. The break strength increases monotonically from $z = 10$ to $z = 3$, and from $\beta_{\rm UV} = -3.0$ to $\beta_{\rm UV} = 0.0$. The break strength is tightly anti-correlated with specific SFR (sSFR), and in dusty galaxies, strongly correlated with dust attenuation. Based on the SFR ratios, we find that bursty star formation thrives in the highest redshift, bluest, and lowest stellar mass galaxies, which exhibit the highest sSFRs. The burstiness appears to plateau at $z &gt; 6$, suggesting that we might be observing the peak of star formation burstiness at these redshifts. The $z &lt; 4$ galaxies do not appear particularly bursty, suggesting that the smooth mode of star formation starts taking over right before cosmic noon. As galaxies mature and develop redder UV colors and more pronounced Balmer breaks, their ability to sustain star formation over longer timescales increases, signalling their transition from bursty to smooth star formation.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the exponent of the energy spectrum is steeper than not only the Kolmogorov but also the Burgers exponent, suggesting that there may be more complex mechanisms for energy transfer than Kolmogorov and Burgers turbulence.</description>

      <title>Coupled Disk-Star Evolution in Galactic Nuclei and the Lifetimes of QPE Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modest fraction of the stars in galactic nuclei fed towards the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) approach on low-eccentricity orbits driven by gravitational-wave radiation (extreme mass ratio inspiral, EMRI). In the likely event that a gaseous accretion disk is created in the nucleus during this slow inspiral (e.g., via an independent tidal-disruption event; TDE), star-disk collisions generate regular short-lived flares consistent with the observed quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources. We present a model for the coupled star-disk evolution which self-consistently accounts for mass and thermal energy injected into the disk from stellar collisions and associated mass ablation. For weak collision/ablation heating, the disk is thermally-unstable and undergoes limit-cycle oscillations which modulate its properties and lead to accretion-powered outbursts on timescales of years to decades, with a time-averaged accretion rate $\sim 0.1 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. Stronger collision/ablation heating acts to stabilize the disk, enabling roughly steady accretion at the EMRI-stripping rate. In either case, the stellar destruction time through ablation, and hence the maximum QPE lifetime, is $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ yr, far longer than fall-back accretion after a TDE. The quiescent accretion disks in QPE sources may at the present epoch be self-sustaining and fed primarily by EMRI ablation. Indeed, the observed range of secular variability broadly match those predicted for collision-fed disks. Changes in the QPE recurrence pattern following such outbursts, similar to that observed in GSN 069, could arise from temporary misalignment between the EMRI-fed disk and the SMBH equatorial plane as the former regrows its mass after a state transition.</description>

      <title>Observed abundance of X-ray low surface brightness clusters in optical, X-ray, and SZ selected samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The comparison of the properties of galaxy cluster samples selected using observations in different wavebands may shed light on potential biases of the way in which the samples are assembled. For this comparison, we introduce a new observable that does not require previous knowledge of the cluster mass: the X-ray mean surface brightness within the central 300 kpc. We found that clusters with low surface brightness, defined as those with a mean surface brightness below 43.35 \subr , are about one quarter of the whole cluster population in a sample of 32 clusters in the nearby Universe, selected independently of the intracluster medium properties. Almost no example of a low central surface brightness cluster exists instead in two X-ray selected samples, one sample based on XMM-Newton XXL-100 survey data and the other on full-depth eROSITA eFEDS data, although these clusters are known to exist in the range of redshift and mass as probed by these two surveys. Furthermore, the Sunayev-Zeldovich Atacama Cosmology Telescope cluster survey is even more selective than the previous two samples because it does not even include clusters with intermediate surface brightness, which are instead present in X-ray selected samples that explore the same volume of the Universe. Finally, a measure of the mean surface brightness, which is obtained without knowledge of the mass, proves to be effective in narrowing the number of clusters to be followed-up because it recognizes those with a low gas fraction or with a low X-ray luminosity for their mass. Identifying these would otherwise require knowledge of the mass for all clusters.</description>

      <title>First image of a jet launching from a black hole accretion system: Kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets are endemic to both Galactic solar mass and extragalactic supermassive black holes. A recent 86 GHz image of M\,87 shows a jet emerging from the accretion ring around a black hole, providing the first direct observational constraint on the kinematics of the jet-launching region in any black hole jetted system. The very wide ($\sim280\mu\rm{as}$), highly collimated, limb-brightened cylindrical jet base is not predicted in current numerical simulations. The emission was shown to be consistent with that of a thick-walled cylindrical source that apparently feeds the flow that produces the bright limbs of the outer jet at an axial distance downstream of $0.4 \,\rm{mas}&lt;z&lt;0.65\, \rm{mas}$. The analysis here applies the conservation laws of energy, angular momentum, and magnetic flux to the combined system of the outer jet, the cylindrical jet, and the launch region. It also uses the brightness asymmetries of the jet and counterjet to constrain the Doppler factor. The only global solutions have a source that is located $&lt;34 \mu\rm{as}$ from the event horizon. This includes the Event Horizon Telescope annulus of emission and the regions interior to this annulus. The axial jet begins as a magnetically dominated flow that spreads laterally from the launch radius ($&lt;34 \mu\rm{as}$). It becomes super-magnetosonic before it reaches the base of the cylindrical jet. The flow is ostensibly redirected and collimated by a cylindrical nozzle formed in a thick accretion disk. The flow emerges from the nozzle as a mildly relativistic ($0.3c&lt;v&lt;0.4c$) jet with a significant protonic kinetic energy flux.</description>

      <title>Pinwheel Outflow induced by Stellar Mass Loss in a Coplanar Triple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a physical framework for interpreting complex circumstellar patterns whorled around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by investigating stable, coplanar triple systems using hydrodynamic and particle simulations. The introduction of a close tertiary body causes an additional periodic variation in the orbital velocity and trajectory of the AGB star. As a result, the circumstellar outflow builds a fine non-Archimedean spiral pattern superimposed upon the Archimedean spiral produced by the outer binary alone. This fine spiral can be approximated by off-centered circular rings that become tangent to each other at the location of the Archimedean spiral. The superimposed fine pattern fades out relatively quickly as a function of distance from the center of the system, in contrast to the dominant Archimedean spiral pattern, which presents a much slower fractional density decrease with radius. The different rates of radial decrease of the density contrast in the two superimposed patterns, coupled with their different time and spatial scales, lead to an apparent, but illusory radial change in the observed pattern interval, as has been reported, for example, in CW Leo. The function describing the detailed radial dependence of the expansion velocity is different in the two patterns, which may be used to distinguish them. The shape of the circumstellar whorled pattern is further explored as a function of the orbital eccentricity and the inner companion's mass. Although this study is confined to stable, coplanar triple systems, the results are likely applicable to moderately noncoplanar systems and open interesting avenues for studying noncoplanar systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Galaxy Groups and AGNs populating the local Universe in the eROSITA era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eROSITA will deliver an unprecedented volume of X-ray survey observations, 20-30 times more sensitive than ROSAT in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) and for the first time imaging in the hard band (2-10 keV) including galaxy clusters and groups along with obscured and unobscured AGNs. This calls for a powerful theoretical effort to control the systematics and biases that may affect the data analysis. We investigate the detection technique and selection effects in the galaxy group and AGN populations of a mock eROSITA survey at the depth of eRASS:4. We create a $30\times 30$ deg$^{2}$ mock observation based on the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder within z=0-0.2. We combine a physical background extracted from the real eFEDS background analysis with realistic simulations of X-ray emission for the hot gas, AGNs and X-ray binaries. We apply a detection procedure equivalent to the reduction done on eRASS data and evaluate the completeness and contamination to reconstruct the luminosity functions of the extended and point sources in the catalogue. We assess the completeness of extended detections as a function of the input X-ray flux and halo. We achieve full recovery of the brightest (most massive) clusters and AGNs. However, a significant fraction of galaxy groups remains undetected. Examining the gas properties between the detected and undetected galaxy groups at fixed halo mass, we observe that the detected population exhibits, on average, higher X-ray brightness compared to the undetected ones. Moreover, we find that X-ray luminosity primarily correlates with the hot gas fraction, rather than temperature or metallicity. Our simulation suggests the presence of a systematic selection effect in current surveys, resulting in X-ray survey catalogues predominantly composed of the lowest-entropy, gas-richest, and highest surface brightness halos on galaxy group scales.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-0845L: A low-mass M dwarf from the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a direct mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses.</description>

      <title>Formation of a $33\,M_{\odot}$ black hole in a low-metallicity binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) and is kinematically part of the Galactic halo, suggesting that the BH formed from a low-metallicity massive star. I show that orbits similar to that of Gaia BH3 are naturally produced through isolated binary evolution. The system's period and eccentricity can result from a broad range of initial orbits with a modest natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 75\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) to the BH. I construct MESA models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. Stars of this size would fit inside most plausible pre-supernova orbits for the system without overflowing their Roche lobes. In addition, models with moderately rapid initial rotation ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 0.45$) undergo chemically homogeneous evolution and never expand to radii larger than $10\,R_{\odot}$. There are thus multiple channels through which a low-metallicity, extreme-mass ratio binary could produce a system like Gaia BH3. Dynamical formation scenarios are also viable, and there is little doubt that both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 will be discovered in Gaia DR4. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant - greatly boosting its detectability - only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM not dead yet: massive high-z Balmer break galaxies are less common than previously reported</title>

Abstract: Early JWST observations that targeted so-called double-break sources (attributed to Lyman and Balmer breaks at $z&gt;7$), reported a previously unknown population of very massive, evolved high-redshift galaxies. This surprising discovery led to a flurry of attempts to explain these objects' unexpected existence including invoking alternatives to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. To test these early results, we adopted the same double-break candidate galaxy selection criteria to search for such objects in the JWST images of the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), and found a sample of 19 sources over five independent CANUCS fields that cover a total effective area of $\sim60\,$arcmin$^2$ at $z\sim8$. However, (1) our SED fits do not yield exceptionally high stellar masses for our candidates, while (2) spectroscopy of five of the candidates shows that while all five are at high redshifts, their red colours are due to high-EW emission lines in star-forming galaxies rather than Balmer breaks in massive, evolved systems. Additionally, (3) field-to-field variance leads to differences of $\sim 1.5$ dex in the maximum stellar masses measured in the different fields, suggesting that the early single-field JWST observations may have suffered from cosmic variance and/or sample bias. Finally, (4) we show that the presence of even a single massive outlier can dominate conclusions from small samples such as those in early JWST observations. In conclusion, we find that the double-break sources in CANUCS are not sufficiently massive or numerous to warrant questioning the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: The core of an extremely massive proto-cluster at the Epoch of Reionization probed with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: The SPT0311-58 system resides in a massive dark matter halo at z ~ 6.9. It hosts two dusty galaxies (E and W) with a combined star formation rate of ~3500 Msun/yr. Its surrounding field exhibits an overdensity of sub-mm sources, making it a candidate proto-cluster.
  We use spatially-resolved spectroscopy provided by the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to probe a field of view (FoV) ~ 17 x 17 kpc^2 around this object.
  These observations have revealed ten new galaxies at z ~ 6.9, characterised by dynamical masses spanning from ~10^9 to 10^10 Msun and a range in radial velocities of ~ 1500 km/s, in addition to the already known E and W galaxies. The implied large number density, and the wide spread in velocities, indicate that SPT0311-58 is at the core of a proto-cluster, immersed in a very massive dark matter halo of ~ 5 x 10^12 Msun. Hence, it represents the most massive proto-cluster ever found at the EoR. We also study the dynamical stage of the system and find that it likely is not fully virialised.
  The galaxies exhibit a great diversity of properties showing a range of evolutionary stages. We derive their ongoing Ha-based unobscured SFR, and find that its contribution to the total SF varies significantly across the galaxies in the system. Their ionization conditions range from those typical of field galaxies at similar redshift recently studied with JWST to those found in more evolved objects at lower z. The metallicity spans more than 0.8 dex across the FoV, reaching nearly solar values in some cases. The detailed IFU spectroscopy of the E galaxy reveals that it is actively assembling its stellar mass, showing sub-kpc inhomogeneities, and a metallicity gradient that can be explained by accretion of low metallicity gas from the IGM. The kinematic maps indicate departures from regular rotation, high turbulence, and a possible pre-collision minor merger. (Abridged)</description>

Abstract: We investigate the torus size -- luminosity relation of Type 1 AGNs based on the reverberation-mapping analysis using the light curves of the optical continuum and the IR continuum obtained with the W1 and W2-bands of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey. The final sample consists of 446 and 416 AGNs, respectively, for W1 and W2-band light curves, covering a large dynamic range of bolometric luminosity from $10^{43.4}$ to $10^{47.6}$ $erg \, s^{-1}$, which show reliable lag measurements based on our quality assessment analysis. After correcting for the accretion disk contamination in the observed IR flux, we constrain the torus size ($R_{dust}$) and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) relationship with the best-fit slope of 0.39 (0.33) for the W1- (W2-) band, which is shallower than expected from the dust radiation equilibrium model. By combining the previous K-band lag measurements, we find that the measured torus size depends on the observed wavelength of the dust radiation, as $R_{dust,K}:R_{dust,W1}:R_{dust,W2}$ = 1.0:1.5:1.8 ($R_{dust} \, \propto \, \lambda^{0.80}$) at $L_{bol}$ = $10^{46} \, erg \, s^{-1}$, confirming a stratified structure of the torus, where wavelength-dependent emissions originate from distinct regions of the torus. By investigating the deviation from the best-fit torus size -- luminosity relation, we find a moderate correlation between the offset from the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relation and Eddington ratio. This suggests a possible influence of the Eddington ratio on the observed flattening of the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relationship.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Faint, Red AGN at $z&gt;4$: A Sample of Little Red Dots in the JWST Extragalactic Legacy Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of 341 "little red dots" (LRDs) spanning the redshift range $z\sim2-11$ using data from the CEERS, PRIMER, JADES, UNCOVER and NGDEEP surveys. These sources are likely heavily-reddened AGN that trace a previously-hidden phase of dust-obscured black hole growth in the early Universe. Unlike past use of color indices to identify LRDs, we employ continuum slope fitting using shifting bandpasses to sample the same rest-frame emission blueward and redward of the Balmer break. This approach allows us to identify LRDs over a wider redshift range and is less susceptible to contamination from galaxies with strong breaks that otherwise lack a rising red continuum. The redshift distribution of our sample increases at $z&lt;8$ and then undergoes a rapid decline at $z\sim4.5$, which may tie the emergence, and obscuration, of these sources to the inside-out growth that galaxies experience during this epoch. We find that LRDs are 2-3 dex more numerous than bright quasars at $z\sim5-7$, but their number density is only 0.6-1 dex higher than X-ray and UV selected AGN at these redshifts. Within our sample, we have identified the first X-ray detected LRDs at $z=3.1$ and $z=4.66$. An X-ray spectral analysis confirms that these AGN are moderately obscured with $\log\,(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{2}$) of $23.3^{+0.4}_{-1.3}$ and $22.72^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$. Our analysis reveals that reddened AGN emission dominates their rest-optical light, while the rest-UV originates from their host galaxies. We also present NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy of 17 LRDs that show broad emission lines consistent with AGN activity. The confirmed AGN fraction of our sample is $71\%$ for sources with F444W$&lt;26.5$. In addition, we find three LRDs with narrow blue-shifted Balmer absorption features in their spectra, suggesting an outflow of high-density, low ionization gas from near the central engine of these faint, red AGN.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a dormant 33 solar-mass black hole in pre-release Gaia astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from black-hole merging events have revealed a population of extra-galactic BHs residing in short-period binaries with masses that are higher than expected based on most stellar evolution models - and also higher than known stellar-origin black holes in our Galaxy. It has been proposed that those high-mass BHs are the remnants of massive metal-poor stars. Gaia astrometry is expected to uncover many Galactic wide-binary systems containing dormant BHs, which may not have been detected before. The study of this population will provide new information on the BH-mass distribution in binaries and shed light on their formation mechanisms and progenitors. As part of the validation efforts in preparation for the fourth Gaia data release (DR4), we analysed the preliminary astrometric binary solutions, obtained by the Gaia Non-Single Star pipeline, to verify their significance and to minimise false-detection rates in high-mass-function orbital solutions. The astrometric binary solution of one source, Gaia BH3, implies the presence of a 32.70 \pm 0.82 M\odot BH in a binary system with a period of 11.6 yr. Gaia radial velocities independently validate the astrometric orbit. Broad-band photometric and spectroscopic data show that the visible component is an old, very metal-poor giant of the Galactic halo, at a distance of 590 pc. The BH in the Gaia BH3 system is more massive than any other Galactic stellar-origin BH known thus far. The low metallicity of the star companion supports the scenario that metal-poor massive stars are progenitors of the high-mass BHs detected by gravitational-wave telescopes. The Galactic orbit of the system and its metallicity indicate that it might belong to the Sequoia halo substructure. Alternatively, and more plausibly, it could belong to the ED-2 stream, which likely originated from a globular cluster that had been disrupted by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Rapid Black Hole Spin-down by Thick Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) spin can play an important role in galaxy evolution by controlling the amount of energy and momentum ejected from near the BH into the surroundings. We focus on radiatively-inefficient and geometrically-thick magnetically-arrested disks (MADs) that can launch strong BH-powered jets. With an appropriately chosen adiabatic index, these systems can describe either the low-luminosity or highly super-Eddington BH accretion regimes. Using a suite of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we find that for any initial spin, a MAD rapidly spins down the BH to the equilibrium spin of $0&lt; a_{\rm eq} \lesssim 0.1$, very low compared to $a_{\rm eq} = 1$ for the standard thin luminous (Novikov-Thorne) disks. This implies that rapidly accreting (super-Eddington) BHs fed by MADs tend to lose most of their rotational energy to magnetized relativistic outflows. In a MAD, a BH only needs to accrete $20\%$ of its own mass to spin down from $a=1$ to $a=0.2$. We construct a semi-analytic model of BH spin evolution in MADs by taking into account the torques on the BH due to both the hydrodynamic disk and electromagnetic jet components, and find that the low value of $a_{\rm eq} $ is due to both the jets slowing down the BH rotation and the disk losing a large fraction of its angular momentum to outflows. Our results have crucial implications for how BH spins evolve in active galaxies and other systems such as collapsars, where BH spin-down timescale can be short enough to significantly affect the evolution of gamma-ray emitting BH-powered jets.</description>

      <title>Enabling Unsupervised Discovery in Astronomical Images through Self-Supervised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning, a branch of machine learning that can operate on unlabelled data, has proven to be a powerful tool for data exploration and discovery in astronomy. As large surveys and new telescopes drive a rapid increase in data size and richness, these techniques offer the promise of discovering new classes of objects and of efficient sorting of data into similar types. However, unsupervised learning techniques generally require feature extraction to derive simple but informative representations of images. In this paper, we explore the use of self-supervised deep learning as a method of automated representation learning. We apply the algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) to Galaxy Zoo DECaLS images to obtain a lower dimensional representation of each galaxy, known as features. We briefly validate these features using a small supervised classification problem. We then move on to apply an automated clustering algorithm, demonstrating that this fully unsupervised approach is able to successfully group together galaxies with similar morphology. The same features prove useful for anomaly detection, where we use the framework astronomaly to search for merger candidates. While the focus of this work is on optical images, we also explore the versatility of this technique by applying the exact same approach to a small radio galaxy dataset. This work aims to demonstrate that applying deep representation learning is key to unlocking the potential of unsupervised discovery in future datasets from telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton --NuSTAR monitoring campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a joint {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} campaign on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 4329A, consisting of 9 $\times$ 20 ks {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and 5 $\times$ 20 ks {\it NuSTAR} observations within nine days, performed in August 2021. Within each observation, the AGN is not very variable, with the fractional variability never exceeding 5%. Flux variations are observed between the different observations, on timescales of days, with a 30% ratio between the minimum and the maximum 2-10 keV flux. These variations follow the softer-when-brighter behavior typically observed in AGN. In all observations, a soft excess is clearly present. Consistently with previous observations, the X-ray spectra of the source exhibit a cut-off energy between 140 and 250 keV, constant within the error in the different observations. We detected a prominent component of the $6.4$\,keV Fe~K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant during the monitoring, consisting of an unresolved narrow core and a broader component likely originating in the inner accredion disc. We find that the reflection component is weak ($R_{\rm max}=0.009\pm0.002$) and most likely originating in distant neutral medium. We also found the presence of a warm absorber component together with an ultra-fast outflow. Looking at their energetic, these outflows have enough mechanical power to exercise a significant feedback impact on the AGN surrounding environment.</description>
