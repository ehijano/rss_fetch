      <title>Lie polynomials in a $q$-deformed universal enveloping algebra of a low-dimensional Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonabelian two-dimensional Lie algebra over a field $\mathbb{F}$ has a presentation by generators $A$, $B$ and relation $\left[ A,B\right]=A$, with the universal enveloping algebra having a presentation by generators $A$, $B$ and relation $AB-BA=A$. A well-known fact is that the said Lie algebra is isomorphic to that which has a universal enveloping algebra that has a presentation by generators $A$, $B$ and relation $AB-BA=B$. Given $q,r,s\in\mathbb{F}$, solutions to the Lie polynomial characterization problems in the corresponding $q$-deformed universal enveloping algebras, with generalized relations $AB-qBA=rA$ and $AB-qBA=sB$, respectively, are presented.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian cohomology of Nijenhuis Lie algebras and the inducibility of automorphisms and derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the non-abelian cohomology group of a Nijenhuis Lie algebra with values in another Nijenhuis Lie algebra and show that it parametrizes the isomorphism classes of all non-abelian extensions. In particular, we obtain a classification result for abelian extensions of a Nijenhuis Lie algebra by a given Nijenhuis representation. Next, given a non-abelian extension of Nijenhuis Lie algebras, we investigate the inducibility of a pair of Nijenhuis Lie algebra automorphisms and show that the corresponding obstruction lies in the non-abelian cohomology group. Subsequently, we also consider the inducibility of a pair of Nijenhuis Lie algebra derivations in a given abelian extension.</description>

      <title>Cohomology theory of Nijenhuis Lie algebras and (generic) Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. In the first part, we define the cohomology of a Nijenhuis Lie algebra with coefficients in a suitable representation. Our cohomology of a Nijenhuis Lie algebra governs the simultaneous deformations of the underlying Lie algebra and the Nijenhuis operator. Subsequently, we define homotopy Nijenhuis operators on $2$-term $L_\infty$-algebras and show that in some cases they are related to third cocycles of Nijenhuis Lie algebras. In another part of this paper, we extend our study to (generic) Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras where the Nijenhuis operators on the underlying Lie algebras and Lie coalgebras need not be the same. In due course, we introduce matched pairs and Manin triples of Nijenhuis Lie algebras and show that they are equivalent to Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras. Finally, we consider the admissible classical Yang-Baxter equation whose antisymmetric solutions yield Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Polygraphic resolutions for operated algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the structure of operated polygraphs as a categorical model for rewriting in operated algebras, generalizing Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases with non-monomial termination orders. We provide a combinatorial description of critical branchings of operated polygraphs using the structure of polyautomata that we introduce in this paper. Polyautomata extend linear polygraphs of an operator structure formalized by a pushdown automata. We show how to construct polygraphic resolutions of free operated algebras from their confluent and terminating presentations. Finally, we apply our constructions to several families of operated algebras, including Rota-Baxter algebras, differential algebras, and differential Rota-Baxter algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a faithful representation $W$ of a finite group $G$, we classify when the invariant subring of the tensor algebra $T(W)$ is noetherian/finitely generated as a twisted commutative algebra (tca). For a representation $W$ of a classical group $G_{\mathbb{Z}}$, we show that the invariant subring $T(W_k)^{G_k}$ is a finitely generated tca for $k$ algebraically closed of sufficiently large characteristics, assuming $W$ admits a good filtration over $\mathbb{Z}$. Finally, we introduce a categorical variant of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension and compute its value to be $\binom{n+1}{2}$ for $T(\mathbb{C}^n)$ as a tca.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that given a differential graded category C and B a full differential graded subcategory closed under coproducts, there is a canonical recollement of differential graded categories, for which we use enriched categories tools. We continue the study of differential graded triangular matrix categories as initiated in [22]. We show that given a recollement between functor dg-categories we can induce a new recollement between differential graded triangular matrix categories, this is a generalization of a result given by Chen and Zheng in [5, Theorem 4.4].</description>

      <title>Twisted Poincar\'e duality for orientable Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We geometrize the constructions of twisted Poisson modules introduced by Luo-Wang-Wu, and Poisson chain complexes with coefficients in Poisson modules defined in the algebraic setting to the geometric setting of Poisson manifolds. We then prove that for any orientable Poisson manifold $M$, there is an explicit chain isomorphism between the Poisson cochain complex with coefficients in any Poisson geometric module and the Poisson chain complex with coefficients in the corresponding twisted Poisson geometric module, induced by a modular vector field of $M$. These are the geometric analogues of results obtained by Luo-Wang-Wu for smooth Poisson algebras with trivial canonical bundle. In particular, a version of twisted Poincar\'e duality is established between the Poisson homologies and the Poisson cohomologies of an orientable Poisson manifold with coefficients in an arbitrary vector bundle with a flat contravariant connection. This generalizes the duality theorems for orientable Poisson manifolds established by Evens-Lu-Weinstein, and by Xu.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Inverse Matrix Theorem via Relational Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Invertible Matrix Theorem (IMT) characterizes equivalent notions of invertibility for square matrices. Moreover, for rectangular matrices, the IMT splits into separate characterizations of injectivity and surjectivity. In this work, we extend this result to linear relations, a generalization of linear maps that encode the solution sets of simultaneous linear systems. We develop a relational decomposition that structurally reveals the fundamental properties of linear relations: totality, determinism, injectivity, and surjectivity. These properties form a hierarchy, which we represent through a directed graph illustrating their logical dependencies. This leads to a natural generalization of the IMT to linear relations. Moreover, this relational decomposition also induces a decomposition for pairs of matrices that explicitly constructs bases for subspaces relevant to the images of both matrices, including their sum and intersection. In this sense, it is an analog of the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) requiring no assumptions on the underlying scalar field. This paper makes use of a graphical notation appropriate for the manipulation of relations. Although not strictly necessary, these diagrams enable equational reasoning and facilitate algebraic manipulations.</description>

      <title>Covering theory, functor categories and the Krull-Gabriel dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assume that $K$ is an algebraically closed field, $R$ a locally bounded $K$-category, $G$ an admissible group of $K$-linear automorphisms of $R$ and $F:R\rightarrow A$ the Galois $G$-covering functor. In the first part of the paper we show that $KG(R)\leq KG(A)$ where $KG$ denotes the Krull-Gabriel dimension. This result is proved by developing the Galois covering theory of functor categories, based on the existence of the general tensor product bifunctor. We understand this theory as the theory of the left and the right adjoint functors $\Phi,\Theta:MOD(\mathcal{R})\rightarrow MOD(\mathcal{A})$ to the pull-up functor $\Psi=(F_{\lambda})_{\bullet}:MOD(\mathcal{A})\rightarrow MOD(\mathcal{R})$, along the push-down functor $F_{\lambda}:\mathcal{R}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{R}=mod(R)$, $\mathcal{A}=mod(A)$ and $(F_{\lambda})_{\bullet}=(-)\circ F_{\lambda}$. In the case $F_{\lambda}$ is dense, $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ are natural generalizations of the classical push-down functors. Generally, $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ restrict to categories $\mathcal{F}(R),\mathcal{F}(A)$ of finitely presented functors and the restricted functors coincide. In the second part of the paper, we show that $\Phi:\mathcal{F}(R)\rightarrow\mathcal{F}(A)$ is a Galois $G$-precovering of functor categories. Next we consider an important special case when $R$ is simply connected locally representation-finite. Then $\Phi$ may be studied in terms of classical covering theory which allows to give an example of $\Phi$ which is not dense. This justifies the introduction of the functors of the first and the second kind, following the terminology of Dowbor and Skowro\'nski. In the final part of the paper, we give special applications of our results. Last but not least, we discuss applications to the conjecture of M. Prest, relating the Krull-Gabriel dimension of an algebra with its representation type.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\textbf{F}_q)$ of traceless matrices over a finite field of characteristic $p$ can be generated by $2$ elements with exceptions when $(n, p)$ is $(3, 3)$ or $(4,2)$. In the latter cases, we establish curious identities that obstruct $2$-generation.</description>

      <title>Bialgebra theory for nearly associative algebras and $LR$-algebras: equivalence, characterization, and $LR$-Yang-Baxter Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the bialgebra theory for two classes of non-associative algebras: nearly associative algebras and $LR$-algebras. In particular, building on recent studies that reveal connections between these algebraic structures, we establish that nearly associative bialgebras and $LR$-bialgebras are, in fact, equivalent concepts. We also provide a characterization of these bialgebra classes based on the coproduct. Moreover, since the development of nearly associative bialgebras - and by extension, $LR$-bialgebras - requires the framework of nearly associative $L$-algebras, we introduce this class of non-associative algebras and explore their fundamental properties. Furthermore, we identify and characterize a special class of nearly associative bialgebras, the coboundary nearly associative bialgebras, which provides a natural framework for studying the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) within this context.</description>

      <title>Bilinear maps on the ring of strictly upper triangular matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a 2-torsion free unital ring and $N_n=N_n(R)$ the ring of strictly upper triangular matrices with entries in $R$ and center $Z=Z(N_n)$. It has been previously shown that any linear map $f:N_n\rightarrow N_n$ satisfying the condition $[f(X),X]=0$ must be of the form $f(X)=\lambda X+\mu(X)$ for some $\lambda\in R$ and additive map $\mu$ defined on $N_n$. We extend these known results by providing a complete description of the bilinear maps $f:N_n\times N_n\rightarrow N_n$ satisfying the identity $[f(X,X),X]=0$ for all $X\in N_n$.</description>

      <title>S-invariant and S-multinvariant functions and some symmetry groups of algebraic sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduced algebraic sieves, i.e. selection procedures on a given finite set to extract a particular subset. Such procedures are performed by finite groups acting on the set. They are called sieves because there are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select, for example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this article we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also introduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain permutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the action of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and multi-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective automorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such sieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant functions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the Goldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected set consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$, with $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. We have shown that one of these symmetry groups is isomorphic to a subgroup or affinity group of the ring of integers modulo N with N an integer even $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group acting on an ice quiver with potential $(Q, F, W)$. We construct the corresponding $G$-equivariant relative cluster category and $G$-equivariant Higgs category, extending the work of Demonet. Using the orbit mutations on the set of $G$-stable cluster-tilting objects of the Higgs category and an appropriate cluster character, we can link these data to an explicit skew-symmetrizable cluster algebra with coefficients. As a specific example, this provides an additive categorification for cluster algebras with principal coefficients in the non-simply laced case.</description>
