      <title>SVD-based Causal Emergence for Gaussian Iterative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal emergence (CE) based on effective information (EI) shows that macro-states can exhibit stronger causal effects than micro-states in dynamics. However, the identification of CE and the maximization of EI both rely on coarse-graining strategies, which is a key challenge. A recently proposed CE framework based on approximate dynamical reversibility utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) is independent of coarse-graining but is limited to transition probability matrices (TPM) in discrete states. To address this problem, this article proposes a pioneering CE quantification framework for Gaussian iterative systems (GIS), based on approximate dynamical reversibility derived from SVD of covariance matrices in forward and backward dynamics. The positive correlation between SVD-based and EI-based CE, along with the equivalence condition, are given analytically. After that, we can provide precise coarse-graining strategies directly from singular value spectrums and orthogonal matrices. This new framework can be applied to any dynamical system with continuous states and Gaussian noise, such as auto-regressive growth models, Markov Gaussian systems, and even SIR modeling by neural networks (NN). Numerical simulations on typical cases validate our theory and offer a new approach to studying the CE phenomenon, emphasizing noise and covariance over dynamical functions in both known models and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Generalized synchronization in the presence of dynamical noise and its detection via recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two unidirectionally coupled nonlinear systems, we speak of generalized synchronization when the responder \textquotedblleft follows\textquotedblright\ the driver. Mathematically, this situation is implemented by a map from the driver state space to the responder state space termed the synchronization map. In nonlinear times series analysis, the framework of the present work, the existence of the synchronization map amounts to the invertibility of the so-called cross map, which is a continuous map that exists in the reconstructed state spaces for typical time-delay embeddings. The cross map plays a central role in some techniques to detect functional dependencies between time series. In this paper, we study the changes in the \textquotedblleft noiseless scenario\textquotedblright\ just described when noise is present in the driver, a more realistic situation that we call the \textquotedblleft noisy scenario\textquotedblright . Noise will be modeled using a family of driving dynamics indexed by a finite number of parameters, which is sufficiently general for practical purposes. In this approach, it turns out that the cross and synchronization maps can be extended to the noisy scenario as families of maps that depend on the noise parameters, and only for \textquotedblleft generic\textquotedblright\ driver states in the case of the cross map. To reveal generalized synchronization in both the noiseless and noisy scenarios, we check the existence of synchronization maps of higher periods (introduced in this paper) using recurrent neural networks and predictability. The results obtained with synthetic and real world data demonstrate the capability of our method.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Neuronal Firing Modes by Electric Fields in a Thermosensitive FitzHugh-Nagumo Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fitzhugh-Nagumo neuronal model is used to explore the influence of the electric field on thermosensitive neurons' dynamics. This study investigates how the electric field affects polarization modulation in cell media induced by changes in ion charge density by adding electrical field as a new variable. Driven by a voltage source acting as an external stimulus current, different firing mode responses of the proposed model are analyzed when an external electrical field is applied. Through computational analysis, the study evaluates the impact of parameters such as cell radius, stimulus voltage source amplitude, frequency, and as well as the presence of an external electric field. The results demonstrate distinct mode transitions of isolated neurons ranging from spiking to bursting, regular and chaotic oscillations. These findings suggest that the firing mode is triggered by periodic external electric fields and cell radius, with the electric field's involvement enhanced to regulate neuron activity and control the dynamics. External electric fields and stimuli play a crucial role in neuronal firing dynamics, affecting the transition between different firing modes. Understanding these effects contributes to the comprehension of neural processes and the potential manipulation of neural activity for various applications in neuroscience and biophysics.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

      <title>Stability of N-front and N-back solutions in the Barkley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish for an intermediate Reynolds number domain the stability of N-front and N-back solutions for each N &gt; 1 corresponding to traveling waves, in an experimentally validated model for the transition to turbulence in pipe flow proposed in [Barkley et al., Nature 526(7574):550-553, 2015]. We base our work on the existence analysis of a heteroclinic loop between a turbulent and a laminar equilibrium proved by Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022], as well as some results from this work. The stability proof follows the verification of a set of abstract stability hypotheses stated by Sandstede in [SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis 29.1 (1998), pp. 183-207] for traveling waves motivated by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. In particular, this completes the first detailed analysis of Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022] leading to a complete existence and stability statement that nicely fits within the abstract framework of waves generated by twisted heteroclinic loops.</description>
