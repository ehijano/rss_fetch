      <title>Local and Global Results on Three Dimensional Rarefaction Waves in Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct centered rarefaction wave solutions given background solutions to the compressible Euler equations. The flow considered in this article is the homentropic flow of perfect gas governed by compressible Euler equations and the gamma-law equation of state in 3-D spherical symmetry. We prove the existence of local in time rarefactions for general background solutions, which corresponds to one side of the solution to the Riemann problem in spherical symmetry. We also prove the existence of global in time rarefactions for background solutions that are close to constant states with reasonable decay.</description>

      <title>Vanishing layer thickness limit of convection in multilayer porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Darcy-Boussinesq framework for convection in multilayered porous media, we investigate the singular limit in which the thickness of one layer tends to zero. We establish that the solution of the full system converges to that of the corresponding limiting model with one fewer layer. The convergence is established in two complementary senses: (i) strong $L^{2}$-convergence over arbitrary finite time intervals, and (ii) upper semi-continuity of the global attractors describing the large-time asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Controllability of a Semilinear System of Parabolic Equations with Nonlocal Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends our previous controllability results for a class of coupled linear parabolic systems with nonlocal interactions, motivated by applications in finance such as generalized Black--Scholes models. We establish local null controllability at a fixed time T&gt;0 for a class of semilinear, nonlocally coupled systems driven by a single internal control acting on one component. The proof combines Kakutani's fixed-point theorem with a controllability/observability estimate for the associated linearized dynamics. In addition, we obtain controllability for a broader class of linear systems than those considered in the first article. The paper concludes with remarks on boundary controllability within the same nonlocal framework and with perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Existence and bounds of nonlinear singularity-free cosmological solutions in a string-inspired gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof for the existence of homogeneous, isotropic and globally singularity-free cosmological solutions in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity with exponential coupling. While numerical studies suggested such solutions exist, a formal proof remained elusive. By employing a novel ``power identity method'' and overcoming significant challenges posed by the strong nonlinearities of the exponential coupling, which are not present in the quadratic coupling analyzed in our companion paper \cite{he2025proofssingularityfreesolutionsscalarization}, we establish a FLRW solution valid for all time $t\in(-\infty,+\infty)$, where the Hubble parameter remains positive and vanishes asymptotically, while the scalar field evolves monotonically. This result align with numerical simulations and offer a firm mathematical foundation for singularity-free cosmology in a string-inspired setting.</description>

      <title>Existence, Stability and Controllability of the parabolic-parabolic thermistor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we establish the well-posedness, energy estimates, stability, and local null controllability for the thermistor system modeled by a parabolic-parabolic system using a control force acting on just one equation of the system. The proof of the controllability is based on appropriate Carleman estimates and Liusternik's inverse function theorem to obtain the local controllability of the nonlinear system. The coupling of the system happens both in the terms of order zero and one, which requires the use of a special Carleman estimate for the system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and regularity of solutions for a class of nonlinear singular elliptic equations involving unbounded coefficients and a singular right-hand side. Specifically, we are interested to problem whose simplest model is \begin{equation*} -\sum_{j=1}^N\partial_{j}\left([1+u^{q}]\vert \partial_{j} u \vert^{p_{j}-2} \partial_{j} u\right)= \frac{f}{u^{\gamma}}\text{ in $\mathcal{D},$}\quad u&gt;0 \text{ in $\mathcal{D},$} \quad u=0 \hbox{ on}\;\; \partial\mathcal{D}, \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{D}$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with $N&gt;2$, $ \gamma\geq0$, $q &gt;0 $, $p_{j}&gt;2$ for all $j=1,...,N$ and the source term $f$ belongs to $L^1(\mathcal{D})$, with $f \geq 0$ and $f \not\equiv 0$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we deal with a non-linear parabolic problem which involving a convection term with super--linear growth, whose model is \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\div(\mathcal{M}(x,t)\nabla u)= -\div(u\log (e+|u|)E(x,t))+f(x,t), \] where $\mathcal{M}$ is a bounded measurable matrix, the vector field $E$ and the function $f$ belong to suitable Lebesgue spaces.

      <title>Differential and Variational Approach to First Order Mean Field Games in a Generalized Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate time dependent, first order Mean Field Games on the torus comparing, in a broad and general framework, the classical differential formulation , given by a Hamilton Jacobi equation coupled with a continuity equation, with a variational approach based on fixed points of a multivalued map acting on probability measures over trajectories.
  We prove existence of fixed points for very general Hamiltonians. When the Hamiltonian is differentiable with respect to the momentum, we show that the evaluation curve of any such fixed point solves a continuity equation driven by a vector field associated with the final condition in the Hamilton Jacobi equation.
  This field is defined without requiring additional regularity conditions on the value function solving the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. The field coincides with the classical vector field of Mean Field Systems at space--differentiability points of the value function lying in the space--time regions where optimal trajectories concentrate.
  Our analysis therefore provides a unified framework that bridges the differential and variational viewpoints in Mean Field Games, showing how aggregate optimality conditions naturally lead to continuity-equation descriptions under the sole assumption of differentiability of the Hamiltonian in the momentum variable.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean elasticity for rods and almost isometric embeddings of geodesic tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a geodesic $\gamma$ of length $2L$ in an oriented Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal M, g)$ and a thin tube $\Omega^*_h$ around $\gamma$ of radius $h$. We study an 'elastic' energy per unit volume $E_h(u)$ of maps $u$ from $\Omega^*_h$ into another oriented Riemannian manifold $(\tilde {\mathcal M},\tilde g)$. The energy $E_h$ is based on the squared distance of the differentials $du$ from the set of orientation preserving linear maps between the corresponding tangent spaces.
  We prove a compactness result for sequences of maps $u_h$ for which $h^{-4} E_h(u_h)$ remains bounded and we study the $\Gamma$-Limit of $h^{-4} E_h(u_h)$ as $h \to 0$ with respect to a suitable notion of convergence for $u_h$ that involves certain blow-ups in the radial direction. This $\Gamma$-convergence result ge\-ne\-ra\-lizes work by Mora and M\"uller on the limiting energy of thin rods in the Euclidean setting.
  We also obtain an expression for the minimum of the limiting energy as a specific quadratic functional in the difference of the pullbacks of the curvature tensors of $\mathcal M$ and $\tilde{\mathcal M}$ along the curves $\gamma$ and $u \circ \gamma$, respectively, thus answering a question by Maor and Shachar, J. Elasticity 134 (2019), pp. 149--173.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear instability of rolls in the 2-dimensional generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework developed in \cite{Gr, JLL, RT1}, we rigorously establish the nonlinear instability of roll solutions to the two-dimensional generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation (gSHE). Our analysis is based on spectral information near the maximally unstable Bloch mode, combined with precise semigroup estimates. We construct a certain class of small initial perturbations that grow in time and cause the solution to deviate from the underlying roll solution within a finite time. This result provides a clear transition from spectral to nonlinear instability in a genuinely two-dimensional setting, where the Bloch parameter $\sigma$ ranges over an unbounded domain.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative estimates for Stokes equations with closely spaced rigid inclusions in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish higher-order derivative estimates for the Stokes equations in a three-dimensional domain containing two closely spaced rigid inclusions. We construct a sequence of auxiliary functions via an inductive process to isolate the leading singular terms of higher-order derivatives within the narrow region between the inclusions. For a class of convex inclusions of general shapes, the construction of three-dimensional auxiliary functions -- unlike the two-dimensional case -- relies on the decay properties of solutions to a class of two-dimensional partial differential equations with singular coefficients. Taking advantage of this, we obtain pointwise upper bounds of derivatives up to the seventh order for general inclusions. Under additional symmetry conditions, we derive optimal estimates for derivatives of arbitrary order. Consequently, we obtain precise blow-up rates for the Cauchy stress and its higher-order derivatives in the narrow region between the inclusions.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of normalized solutions to the upper critical fractional Choquard equation with $L^2$-supercritical perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate normalized solutions with prescribed $L^2$-norm for the upper critical fractional Choquard equation \[(-\Delta)^s u+V(\varepsilon x)u=\lambda u+\big(I_\alpha*|u|^{p}\big)|u|^{p-2}u+\big(I_\alpha*|u|^{q}\big)|u|^{q-2}u\quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^N,\] where $N&gt;2s$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $(N-4s)^+&lt;\alpha&lt;N$, and the nonlocal exponents satisfy \[\frac{N+2s+\alpha}{N}&lt; q&lt; p=\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2s},\] so that both nonlinearities are $L^2$-supercritical and the $p$ term has upper critical growth of Hartree type. Under standard assumptions on the slowly varying potential $V$, we develop a constrained variational approach on the $L^2$-sphere, based on a truncation-penalization of the critical term in the energy functional, to overcome the lack of compactness. We prove that, for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the problem admits at least $\mathrm{cat}_{M_\delta}(M)$ distinct normalized solutions, where $M$ is the set of global minima of $V$ and these solutions concentrate near $M$ as $\varepsilon\to0$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interior $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity estimates for solutions of fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations of the general form $F(D^2u)=0$ in two independent variables and without any geometric condition on $F$. By means of the theory of divergence form equations we prove that $C^2$ solutions of the previous equation are $C^{2,\bar\alpha(\lambda/\Lambda)}$ in the interior of the domain, where $0&lt;\lambda\leq\Lambda$ are the ellipticity constants. We finally exploit the theory of nondivergence equations in the plane to obtain $C^{2,\tilde\alpha}$ regularity for an explicit exponent $\tilde\alpha=\tilde\alpha(\lambda/\Lambda)&gt;\lambda/\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of a thin linear elastic plate reinforced with a periodic mosaic of small rigid plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of linearized elasticity, we study thin elastic composite plates with thickness $\delta$. The plates contain small, rigid rectangular plates distributed periodically along $\varepsilon$. Between two neighboring rigid plates is an elastic beam with thickness $\delta &lt; \varepsilon/3 &lt; 1$. Through a simultaneous process of homogenization and dimension reduction, we obtain the limit model. Our analysis yields Korn-type inequalities adapted to the rigid-elastic geometry of the structure and provides a precise characterization of the limit deformation and displacement fields. In the $2$D limit problem, the bending is the sum of two functions, each depending on only one variable. This is due to the fact that the mixed derivatives of the outer-plane displacement vanish. Finally, the limiting 2D problem is two decoupled plates or strips, each one with just three degrees of freedom: shear along the strip axis, the cross-contraction (-extension), and the cross-bending. The corresponding correctors are defined in the same way in the periodicity cell. In the linearized setting, all the correctors are decomposed.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{C}^{\alpha}$-regularity for nonlinear non-diagonal parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the elliptic theory for $p$-Laplacian-like problems, the H\"{o}lder continuity of solutions has been proven for problems arising as Euler--Lagrange equations of a convex potential with $p$-growth that additionally satisfies the splitting condition.
  In this article, we extend these results to the parabolic setting. We investigate nonlinear parabolic systems whose structure parallels the elliptic case but incorporates time dependence. Assuming suitable space-time regularity of $F$ and natural structural conditions analogous to the stationary theory, we establish $\mathcal{C}^{\alpha}$-regularity of weak solutions in space and time whenever the growth parameter $p&gt;d/2$. This extends the classical result for parabolic systems, which is valid only for $p&gt;d-2$. This is the only regularity result for systems that are far from the radial (Uhlenbeck) structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability threshold of the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations around the Couette flow in an infinite channel $\mathbb{R} \times [-1, 1]$ under no-slip boundary conditions. We prove that the Couette flow is asymptotically stable under initial perturbations satisfying $\| \mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{in}} -(y,0)\|_{H^2} \le \varepsilon_0 \nu^{\frac12}$, and $\| \rho^{\mathrm{in}}-1 \|_{H^1} + \big\| |\partial_x|^{\frac13} \rho^{\mathrm{in}} \big\|_{H^1} \le \varepsilon_1 \nu^{\frac56}$.

Anal., 284 (2023), 109736], where the asymptotic stability of the 2D Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq system around Couette flow in a finite channel $\mathbb{T} \times [-1, 1]$ was established, our result improves the stability threshold for the temperature from $\nu^{\frac{11}{12}}$ to $\nu^{\frac56}$.</description>

      <title>On solvability of parabolic equations with singular coefficients in odd mixed-norm Morrey-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for second-order parabolic equations in the whole space with constant zeroth-order coefficient in mixed-norm Morrey-Sobolev spaces. The main coefficient $a$ is assumed to be measurable in $t$ and BMO in $x$ and the first-order coefficients $b$ are in an appropriate mixed-norm Morrey classes (thus admitting rather rough singularities). The mixed-norm Morrey-Sobolev spaces are ``odd'' in the sense that the interior integration in the formula defining the norm is performed with respect to $t$ and not to $x$ as is customary.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of solitary waves for the b-family of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic stability of lefton solutions-exponentially localized stationary solitary waves-for the $b$-family of equations with positive momentum density in the regime $b &lt; -1$. Unlike the completely integrable Camassa-Holm $(b=2)$ and Degasperis-Procesi $(b=3)$ cases, this parameter range lies outside integrability and exhibits distinct nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis adapts the Martel-Merle framework for generalized KdV equations to the nonlocal, non-integrable structure of the $b$-family of equations. The proof combines a nonlinear Liouville property for solutions localized near leftons with a refined spectral analysis of the associated linearized operator. These results provide the first rigorous asymptotic stability theory for leftons in the non-integrable $b$-family of equations.</description>

      <title>Existence of two thresholds in a bistable equation with nonlocal competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal bistable reaction-diffusion equation, which serves as a model for a population structured by a phenotypic trait, subject to mutation, trait-dependent fitness, and nonlocal competition. Within this replicator-mutator framework, we further incorporate a ''pseudo-Allee effect'' so that the long time behavior (extinction vs. survival) depends on the size of the initial data. After proving the well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem, we investigate its long-time behavior. We first show that small initial data lead to extinction. More surprisingly, we then prove that that extinction may also occur for too large initial data, in particular when selection is not strong enough. Finally, we exhibit situations where intermediate initial data lead to persistence, thereby revealing the existence of (at least) two thresholds. These results stand in sharp contrast with the behavior observed in local bistable equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a linear model of navigation in a two-layer fluid with a variable velocity of the ship. A spectral version of the model including a Rayleigh damping term is analyzed. We prove that the Cauchy problem has a unique solution if the velocity and if the initial data are sufficiently regular. The case of a constant speed is thoroughly investigated and the importance of a critical speed which separates two types of regimes is pointed out. We propose a numerical scheme based on the discrete Fourier transform for the space discretization and on an exponential integrator for the time discretization. We prove an error estimate for the exponential integrator. Numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions complete the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every nearly spherical manifold can be realized as the volume-preserving image of a round sphere, via the Brenier-McCann optimal transport map. This theorem extends Caffarelli's contraction theorem to nearly spherical manifolds and yields, as a corollary, a proof of a perturbative form of Milman's conjecture. The proof is based on a novel stability result for optimal transport maps on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Mountain pass for the Ginzburg-Landau energy in a strip: solitons and solitonic vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we study critical points of the Ginzburg-Landau energy in an infinite strip where phase imprinting is applied to half of the domain. We prove that there is a critical width of the cross section below which the soliton solution is a mountain pass solution and the minimizer within the subspace of odd functions. Above the critical width, we find that the mountain pass solution is a vortex with a solitonic behaviour in the infinite direction, called a solitonic vortex. Moreover, depending on the width, we prove that the minimizer in a space with some symmetries can display one or several solitonic vortices. While the problem shares some similarities with the analysis of stability and minimality of the Ginzburg-Landau vortex of degree one in a disk or the whole plane, the change in geometry introduces subtle analytical differences. Extensions to the case of an infinite cylinder in 3D are also given.</description>

      <title>Velocity Averaging Lemmas: Classical, Quantum and Semi-Classical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Averaging lemmas were introduced as a tool of the mathematical analysis of kinetic equations, i.e. PDEs for functions in phase space $(x,v)$ containing a transport ("advection") term. By integrating over $v$ in velocity space $\mathbb{R}_v^d$ (velocity averaging), one gains regularity for the density in position space $\mathbb{R}_x^d$. The concept was invented independently by V.I. Agoshkov and by F. Golse, B. Perthame, R. Sentis and P.-L. Lions, and successfully applied to the analysis of Vlasov or Boltzmann equations in "classical kinetic theory". In "quantum kinetic theory", the Schr\"odinger equation for the complex-valued "wave function" in the physical space is converted into the Wigner equation for the real-valued Wigner function in phase space (which can take negative values). The Wigner ("Quantum Vlasov") equation contains the transport term of classical kinetic equations plus a pseudo-differential operator containing the potential. We give answers to the long standing question of whether and to which extent averaging lemmas apply to the "quantum" case of the Wigner equation. The hard part are the "semi-classical" averaging lemmas, where one considers the asymptotics of vanishing Planck constant towards the non-negative Wigner measure. In that context "pure vs. mixed states" play a crucial role, as well as the connection between the Schr\"odinger equation and Quantum Hydrodynamics (QHD). We present the results for the classical and quantum cases and sketch the "semi-classical" case which is worked out in full detail in a follow-up article.</description>

      <title>Functional-Analytic Justification of the Time-Domain Foldy-Lax Approximation for Dispersive Acoustic Media: A Feynman-Diagram Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a rigorous functional-analytic justification for a time-domain Foldy-Lax framework that describes multiple acoustic scattering by a cluster of dispersive resonators (modeling gas-filled bubbles), explicitly incorporating dispersion via the Minnaert resonance. The model is formulated as a delayed-coupled hyperbolic system for bubble amplitude interactions. We combine time-domain integral equations, Laplace transforms, and Hardy-Sobolev space techniques to analyze this system, establishing its unique solvability in anisotropic Hilbert spaces, with solutions expressed as convergent Neumann series of convolution operators. We derive geometric decay of truncation errors for resonant incident waves and quantify the contribution of $N$-th order multi-scattering, showing it scales with \(\varepsilon^{N(1-p)+1}\) (relating bubble radius \(\varepsilon\) and inter-bubble distance scaling as $\varepsilon^p$, $p&lt;1$). This dominates the measurement errors, which are of order $\varepsilon^2$, thereby allowing us to capture fields generated by inter-bubble interactions of order $N&lt;\frac{1}{1-p}$. This provides a quantitative relation between the spectra band width of the source field, the closeness distance between the bubbles and the order $N$ of the relevant interactions between the bubbles. Furthermore, a novel connection to Feynman diagrams maps multi-scattering paths to diagrammatic vertices and propagators, simplifying the interpretation of higher-order interactions and kinematic constraints. This framework advances accurate transient wave prediction in dispersive media, with implications for cavitation therapy, seismic imaging, and metamaterial engineering.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonlocal-to-local convergence for a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with anisotropic and singular kernels. In particular, we show convergence of weak solutions of the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation to weak solutions of a corresponding anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation for suitable subsequences. Moreover, we show existence of weak solutions for the nonlocal equation under a condition, which guarantees existence of weak solutions for suitably localized or singular kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the normalized solutions for the planar Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system with a two-electron interaction, which models the effect between electrons and the electrostatic potential they generate. As the parameters vary, some existence results are established. Specifically, a ground state solution is obtained for some general cases. The existence of two solutions is established for the mass-supercritical case, one of which is a ground state solution and the other one is an excited state solution. We develop a compactness method to deal with the functionals involving logarithmic convolution terms. The Poho\v{z}aev identity for the coupled Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system with a logarithmic convolution term is also shown, which is crucial for addressing the mass-supercritical problem.</description>

Abstract: The theory of one-sided coupled operator matrices, recently introduced by K.-J. Engel, is an abstract framework for concrete initial value problems and allows complete information on well-posedness, and stability of solutions. These notes are meant as a survey on this rich theory, with a particular stress on applications to initial-boundary value problems with unbounded boundary feedbacks. A diffusion-transport system with dynamical boundary conditions is discussed, and its well-posedness and various other properties are investigated. As a by-product, the well-posedness of a wave equation with dynamical boundary condition is also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linearized 2D Euler equations around radial vortex profiles. Previous works have shown that the strict monotonicity of the vorticity profile leads to axisymmetrization and inviscid damping of non-radial perturbations.
  Given any strictly decreasing radial vortex, we construct arbitrarily close (in low H\"{o}lder norms $C^\alpha$, with $0&lt;\alpha &lt; 1$) radial profiles that are merely non-increasing, for which non-radial, time-periodic solutions to the linearized equation exist. This shows that both axisymmetrization and inviscid damping are not robust under small, low-regularity perturbations of the background profile that violate strict monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the scattering resonances of general acoustic media in a one-dimensional setting using the propagation matrix approach. Specifically, we characterize the resonant frequencies as the zeros of an explicit trigonometric polynomial. Leveraging Nevanlinna's value distribution theory, we establish the distribution properties of the resonances and demonstrate that their imaginary parts are uniformly bounded, which contrasts with the three-dimensional case. In two classes of high-contrast regimes, we derive the asymptotics of both subwavelength and non-subwavelength resonances with respect to the contrast parameter. Furthermore, by applying the Newton polygon method, we recover the discrete capacitance matrix approximation for subwavelength Minnaert resonances in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases, thereby establishing its connection to the propagation matrix framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate solutions for a fractional system involving a novel class of Kirchhoff functions and logarithmic nonlinearity:
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{lll} \displaystyle \mathfrak{u}_{t}+\mathcal{K}\left([\mathfrak{u}]_p^s\right) \mathscr{L}_p^s u=\vert \mathfrak{v} \vert^{\sigma }\vert \mathfrak{u} \vert^{\sigma-2} u \log | \mathfrak{u} \mathfrak{v}|, \, \, &amp; \mbox{in}\quad &amp;\mathcal{U} \times[0, T),\\ \mathfrak{v}_t+\mathcal{K}\left([\mathfrak{v}]_q^s\right) \mathscr{L}_q^s \mathfrak{v}=\vert \mathfrak{u} \vert^{\sigma }|\mathfrak{v}|^{\sigma-2} \mathfrak{v} \log | \mathfrak{u} \mathfrak{v}|, &amp; \text { in } &amp; \mathcal{U} \times[0, T), \\ \mathfrak{u}(\mathrm{x}, t)=\mathfrak{v}(\mathrm{x}, t)=0, &amp; \text { in } &amp; \partial \mathcal{U} \times[0, T), \\ \mathfrak{u}(\mathrm{x}, 0)=\mathfrak{u}_0(\mathrm{x}), \mathfrak{v}(\mathrm{x}, 0)=\mathfrak{v}_0(\mathrm{x}), &amp; \text { in } &amp; \mathcal{U}, \end{array}% \right. \end{equation*}
  where $\mathcal{K}$ is Kirchhoff function, and $\mathscr{L}_{p}^{s}$ is the fractional $p-$ Laplacian operator. We prove the existence of a weak solution using the Faedo-Galerkin method under suitable assumptions on the Kirchhoff function. We investigate the finite-time blow-up and global existence of solutions based on critical, subcritical, and supercritical initial energy levels. Subsequently, we establish the stabilization of the solution with positive initial energy by applying Komornik's integral inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of positive solutions with a prescribed mass for nonlinear Schrodinger equations on an annulus, possibly in the Sobolev supercritical regime. A reduction method based on the Hopf fibration is used to transform the problem into a lower-dimensional one. We obtain a new mass critical threshold and we show that in the new mass subcritical or critical regimes there exists a positive solution which corresponds to a global minimizer, while in the mass supercritical regime, there exists two positive solutions which correspond to a local minimizer and a mountain pass solution respectively. Some other problems are also discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Conservative Formulations of the Standard Enskog and Povzner Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a conservative formulation of the Standard Enskog equation and the Povzner equation, both of which generalize the Boltzmann equation by incorporating the contribution of particle volume in collisions. The primary result expresses these collision integrals as the divergence with respect to the velocity variable v of a mass current. Moreover, the terms v C[f,f] and |v|^2 C[f,f], where C[f,f] denotes the Standard Enskog or Povzner collision integral, are represented as phase-space divergences (that is, divergences in both position and velocity) of corresponding momentum and energy currents.

      <title>Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for parabolic nonlocal equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we establish the optimal $C^s$ boundary regularity for solutions to nonlocal parabolic equations in divergence form in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains and prove a higher order boundary Harnack principle in this setting. Our approach applies to a broad class of nonlocal operators with merely H\"older continuous coefficients, but our results are new even in the translation invariant case. As an application, we obtain sharp two-sided estimates for the associated Dirichlet heat kernel. Notably, our estimates cover nonlocal operators with time-dependent coefficients, which had remained open in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an abstract approach to find couples $(\lambda,u) \in \mathbb{R} \times X$ satisfying $$\Phi_\lambda(u)=c \quad \mbox{and} \quad \Phi'_\lambda(u)=0,$$ for some suitable values of $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Here $\Phi_\lambda$ is a $C^1$ functional (set on a Banach space $X$) whose main prototype is the energy functional associated to a concave-convex problem with sign-changing or vanishing weights. This approach allows us to derive several existence, multiplicity and bifurcation type results for the equation $\Phi'_\lambda(u)=0$ with $\lambda$ fixed.</description>

      <title>Absence of Exponential Stability and Polynomial Stabilization in a Class of Beam Models with Tip Rotary Inertia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dissipative dynamic boundary conditions applied at one end of a beam, analyzing their influence on model stability within the Euler-Bernoulli framework. Our primary finding is that hybrid dissipation does not alter the decay characteristics of the original model. We examine two scenarios: first, when hybrid dissipation is the sole dissipative mechanism, and second, when it complements other dissipative mechanisms. In the first case, we demonstrate that hybrid dissipation fails to induce exponential decay, instead producing a slow decay rate of $t^{-1/2}$ for large $t$. In the second case, when acting as a complementary mechanism, hybrid dissipation neither enhances nor diminishes the decay behavior of the original model.</description>

      <title>Turing pattern induced by cross-diffusion in cancer immunotherapy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a mathematical model describing the interactions between effector cells (E), cancer cells (T), and the IL-2 compound (IL). The model considered here is a generalization, taking into account some cross-diffusion effects, of a spatial cancer immunotherapy model proposed by S. Suddin et al in 2021. These modifications allow us to describe two biologically relevant scenarios: a patient treated with Adoptive Cell Immunotherapy (ACI) and a patient not receiving any treatment/therapy. Cross-diffusion effects are particularly relevant in the interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, in fact they play a key role in immune response dynamics and cannot be neglected. We analyze the equilibrium points of the homogeneous system, along with their stability and bifurcation mechanisms. Furthermore, adopting the Turing approach for reaction-diffusion systems, we investigate the diffusion-driven instability and the emergence of spatial regular structures (stationary in time), i.e. the patterns. Finally, numerical simulations based on the Finite Difference Method (FDM) are presented for the two previously mentioned scenarios.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an acceleration corrected diffusion approximation of Langevin dynamics with background flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00685v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the Langevin dynamics of inertial particles being transported by a background flow. In particular, we study an acceleration corrected advection-diffusion approximation to the Langevin dynamics, a popular approximation in the study of turbulent transport. We prove error estimates in the averaging regime in which the dimensionless relaxation timescale $\varepsilon$ is the small parameter. We show that for any finite time interval, the approximation error is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ in the strong sense and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ in the weak sense, whose optimality is checked against computational experiment. Furthermore, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this approximation also captures the long-time behavior of the Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation and discrepancy modeling with shallow recurrent decoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Completeness of reparametrization-invariant Sobolev metrics on the space of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reparametrization-invariant Sobolev-type Riemannian metrics on the space of immersed surfaces and establish conditions ensuring metric and geodesic completeness as well as the existence of minimizing geodesics. This provides the first extension of completeness results for immersed curves, originating from works of Bruveris, Michor, and Mumford, and validates an earlier conjecture of Mumford on completeness properties of general spaces of immersions in this important case.
  The result is obtained by recasting earlier approaches to completeness on manifolds of mappings as a general completeness criterion for infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds that are open subsets of a complete Riemannian manifold and by combining it with geometric estimates based on the Michael--Simon--Sobolev inequality to establish the completeness for specific Sobolev metrics on immersed surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the numerical approximation of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations modeling magnetostriction in the small-strain regime consisting of the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation for the magnetization and the conservation of linear momentum law for the displacement. We propose a fully discrete numerical scheme based on first-order finite elements for the spatial discretization. The time discretization employs a combination of the classical Newmark-$\beta$ scheme for the displacement and the midpoint scheme for the magnetization, applied in a decoupled fashion. The resulting method is fully linear, formally of second order in time, and we prove that it is unconditionally stable. Finally, we assess the stability, accuracy, and energy conservation properties of the proposed method in a collection of numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We construct Cauchy initial data for the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon (EMKG) system, which evolves in finite time into spacetimes containing multiple trapped surfaces. From a physical perspective, this corresponds to preparing multiple well-separated boson stars, each of which collapses to form a spacelike black hole region. In particular, this extends the result of the second and third named authors on the formation of multiple trapped surfaces in vacuum to the EMKG system.</description>

Abstract: We study the discrete eigenvalues emerging from the threshold of the essential spectrum of one or two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with complex-valued $ L^p $-potentials in a weak coupling regime. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the potential for the existence or absence of discrete eigenvalues in this regime and also analyze their uniqueness and algebraic multiplicity. Our results can be viewed as natural non-self-adjoint extensions of the well-known classical weak coupling phenomenon for self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators with real-valued potentials going back half a century to Simon's famous paper [Simon 1976].</description>

      <title>Harnack inequality for fractional Laplacian-type operators on hyperbolic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the Krylov--Safonov theory for a large class of nonlocal operators of order $2s \in (0,2)$ on hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\kappa}$ with curvature $-\kappa&lt;0$. We prove the Alexandrov--Bakelman--Pucci (ABP) estimates, Krylov--Safonov Harnack inequality, and H\"older estimates. Notably, the Harnack inequality is new even for the fractional Laplacian. The novelty of the results lies in the robustness of the regularity estimates as $s \to 1$ and $\kappa \to 0$: they recover the classical regularity estimates for second-order operators on $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\kappa}$ as $s \to 1$, and for fractional-order operators on Euclidean spaces as $\kappa \to 0$. Since the operators on hyperbolic spaces exhibit qualitatively different behavior compared to their Euclidean counterparts, we introduce new scale functions which take the effect of negative curvatures into account.</description>

Abstract: We prove quantitative estimates on the the parabolic Green function and the stationary invariant measure in the context of stochasic homogenization of elliptic equations in nondivergence form. We consequently obtain a quenched, local CLT for the corresponding diffusion process and a quantitative ergodicity estimate for the environmental process. Each of these results are characterized by deterministic (in terms of the environment) estimates which are valid above a random, ``minimal'' length scale, the stochastic moments of which we estimate sharply.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06660v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-consistent Pauli-Poisswell and Pauli-Darwin equations for 2-spinors are $O(1/c)$ (where $c$ denotes the speed of light) semi-relativistic approximations of the Dirac-Maxwell equation for 4-spinors coupled to the self-consistent electromagnetic fields generated by the charge and current densities of a fast moving electric charge. They consist of a vector-valued magnetic Schr\"odinger equation with the Stern-Gerlach term which couples spin and magnetic field, coupled to 1+3 Poisson equations as the magnetostatic approximation of Maxwell's equations.
  The Pauli-Poisswell and Pauli-Dariwn euqations are $O(1/c)$ models keeping both relativistic effects magnetism and spin, both of which are absent in the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation and inconsistent in the magnetic Schr\"odinger-Maxwell equation.
  We prove the local in time semiclassical limit $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ to the Euler-Poisswell equation and Euler-Darwin equations based on WKB analysis and energy estimates. Moreover we obtain weak convergence of the monokinetic Wigner transform to the monokinetic scalar Wigner measure solving the Vlasov-Poisswell and Vlasov-Darwin equations and strong convergence of the macroscopic densities. We introduce the Euler-Poisswell/Darwin equation and prove local wellposedness and a blow up alternative.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Krein-Rutman theory for semigroups of positive operators in a Banach lattice framework and we provide some very general, efficient and handy results with constructive estimates about: the existence of a solution to the first eigentriplet problem; the geometry of the principal eigenvalue problem; the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector with possible constructive rate of convergence. This abstract theory is motivated and illustrated by several examples of differential, integro-differential and integral operators. In particular, we revisit the first eigenvalue problem and the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector for: some parabolic equations in a bounded domain and in the whole space; some transport equations in a bounded or unbounded domain, including some growth-fragmentation models and some kinetic models; the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation in the torus and in the whole space; some mutation-selection models.</description>

We focus more specifically on the case where $\Psi$ satisfies \begin{equation}\label{starting-equation-abstract} (\imath \partial\_t-\partial^2\_x)\Psi=\dot{B}, \quad \Psi\_0=0,\quad \quad t\in \R, \ x\in \mathbb{T}, \end{equation} where $\dot{B}$ is a white noise in space with fractional time covariance of index $H&gt;\frac12$. \smallskip As an consequence of our analysis, we obtain that if $H$ is close to $\frac12$ (that is $\dot{B}$ is close to a space-time white noise), then it is essentially impossible to treat the stochastic NLS problem \begin{equation*} (\imath \partial\_t-\partial^2\_x)u= |u|^2+\dot{B}, \quad u\_0=0,\quad \quad t\in \R, \ x\in \mathbb{T}, \end{equation*} using only a first-order expansion of the solution (\enquote{$u=\Psi+z$}).</description>

      <title>Families of costs with zero and nonnegative MTW tensor in optimal transport and the c-divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the information geometry of $\bcc$-divergences from families of costs of the form $\mathsf{c}(x, \barx) =\mathsf{u}(x^{\mathfrak{t}}\barx)$ through the optimal transport point of view. Here, $\mathsf{u}$ is a scalar function with inverse $\mathsf{s}$, $x^{\ft}\barx$ is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing of vectors $x, \barx$ belonging to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We compute explicitly the MTW tensor (or cross curvature) for the optimal transport problem on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with this cost. The condition that the MTW-tensor vanishes on null vectors under the Kim-McCann metric is a fourth-order nonlinear ODE, which could be reduced to a linear ODE of the form $\mathsf{s}^{(2)} - S\mathsf{s}^{(1)} + P\mathsf{s} = 0$ with constant coefficients $P$ and $S$. The resulting inverse functions include {\it Lambert} and {\it generalized inverse hyperbolic\slash trigonometric} functions. The square Euclidean metric and $\log$-type costs are equivalent to instances of these solutions. The optimal map may be written explicitly in terms of the potential function. For cost functions of a similar form on a hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space and unit sphere, we also express this tensor in terms of algebraic expressions in derivatives of $\mathsf{s}$ using the Gauss-Codazzi equation, obtaining new families of strictly regular costs for these manifolds, including new families of {\it power function costs}. We express the divergence geometry of the $\mathsf{c}$-divergence in terms of the Kim-McCann metric, including a $\mathsf{c}$-Crouzeix identity and a formula for the primal connection. We analyze the $\sinh$-type hyperbolic cost, providing examples of $\mathsf{c}$-convex functions, which are used to construct a new \emph{local form} of the $\alpha$-divergences on probability simplices. We apply the optimal maps to sample the multivariate $t$-distribution.</description>

Abstract: We study the copolynomials of $n$ variables, i.e. $K$-linear mappings from the ring of polynomials $K[x_1,...,x_n]$ into the commutative ring $K$.
  We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for a linear differential equation of infinite order which can be considered as an algebraic version of the classical Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem for the existence of the fundamental solution of a linear differential operator with constant coefficients. We find the fundamental solutions of linear differential operators of infinite order and show that the unique solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous equation can be represented as a convolution of the fundamental solution of this operator and the right-hand side. We also prove the existence and uniqueness theorem of the Cauchy problem for some linear differential equations in the module of formal power series with copolynomial coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We prove local bounds on the amplitude of eigen- functions of complex constant-coefficient elliptic operators with a smooth potential on an arbitrary open subset of \R^d by estimating it in terms of the number of solutions of a diophantine inequality arising from the symbol of the operator. In the special case of positive elliptic operators, we recover H \"ormander's classical exponent up to an arbitrarily small loss. We show that a much better exponent may be obtained when the principal symbol of the oper- ator has complex coefficients. We generalize our estimate to any higher-order derivatives of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Volume Preserving Willmore Flow in a Generalized Cahn-Hilliard Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mass-preserving $L^2$-gradient flow associated with a generalized Cahn--Hilliard equation. Our focus is on the sharp interface regime, where the interface width parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is small. For well-prepared initial data, we rigorously prove that, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, solutions of the diffuse-interface model converge to the \emph{volume-preserving Willmore flow} in arbitrary spatial dimensions $n \geq 2$. The proof incorporates matched asymptotic expansions and energy estimates to establish convergence of the order parameter away from the interface, alongside precise motion law derivation for the limiting interface. This result extends the analysis of Fei and Liu~\cite{fei2021phase} from two-dimensional settings to general $n$-dimensional domains, and it applies to a broad class of symmetric double-well potentials beyond the classical quartic form. Our work thus provides a general PDE framework linking higher-order phase-field models to volume-preserving curvature flows in the sharp interface limit.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lipschitz stability in the Calder\'on problem and general Zernike bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calder\'on's inverse conductivity problem has, so far, only been subject to conditional logarithmic stability for infinite-dimensional classes of conductivities and to Lipschitz stability when restricted to finite-dimensional classes. Focusing our attention on the unit ball domain in any spatial dimension $d\geq 2$, we give an elementary proof that there are (infinitely many) infinite-dimensional classes of conductivities for which there is Lipschitz stability. In particular, Lipschitz stability holds for general expansions of conductivities, allowing all angular frequencies but with limited freedom in the radial direction, if the basis coefficients decay fast enough to overcome the growth of the basis functions near the domain boundary. We construct general $d$-dimensional Zernike bases and prove that they provide examples of infinite-dimensional Lipschitz stability.</description>

      <title>On the $\Gamma$-limit of weighted fractional energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $p\in[1,\infty)$ and a bounded open set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ with Lipschitz boundary, we study the $\Gamma$-convergence of the weighted fractional seminorm \[ [u]_{s,p,f}^p = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \int_{\mathbb R^d} \frac{|\tilde{u}(x)- \tilde{u}(y)|^p}{\|x-y\|^{d+sp}}\,f(x)\,f(y)\,\mathrm{d} x\,\mathrm{d} y \] as $s\to1^-$ for $u\in L^p(\Omega)$, where $\tilde{u}=u$ on $\Omega$ and $\tilde{u}=0$ on $\mathbb R^d\setminus\Omega$. Assuming that $(f_s)_{s\in(0,1)}\subset L^\infty(\mathbb R^d;[0,\infty))$ and $f\in\mathrm{Lip}_b(\mathbb R^d;(0,\infty))$ are such that $f_s\to f$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb R^d)$ as $s\to1^-$, we show that $(1-s)[u]_{s,p,f_s}$ $\Gamma$-converges to the Dirichlet $p$-energy weighted by $f^2$. In the case $p=2$, we also prove the convergence of the corresponding gradient flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of finite-energy weak solutions for the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional torus. We focus first on the homogeneous case where the ambient (incompressible and viscous) fluid carrying the particles has a constant density, and then on the variable-density case. In both cases, large-time convergence to a monokinetic final state is demonstrated. For any finite energy initial data, we exhibit an algebraic convergence rate that deteriorates as the initial particle distribution increases. When the initial particle distribution is suitably small, then the convergence rate becomes exponential, a result consistent with the work of Han-Kwan et al. [17] dedicated to the homogeneous, three-dimensional case, where an additional smallness condition on the velocity was required. In the non-homogeneous case, we establish similar stability results, allowing a piecewise constant fluid density with jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct local (in time) strong solutions in {$H^s(\mathbb{R}^3)$, $s&gt;3/2$} and global weak solutions with finite energy for both the Pauli-Darwin and the Pauli-Poisswell systems. These are the first rigorous results on local and global wellposedness for these nonlinear first-order semi-relativistic quantum models for fast moving electrons. The Pauli equation is essentially a vector-valued magnetic Schr\"odinger equation for a 2-spinor with an additional Stern-Gerlach term coupling spin and magnetic field, keeping terms up to first order in $1/c$, where $c$ denotes the speed of light. The self-consistent electromagnetic field is computed from the charge density and current density by semi-relativistic approximations of the Maxwell equations: the Poisswell equation at $O(1/c)$ and the Darwin equation at $O(1/c^2)$.\\ We present the physics and asymptotic relations and provide proofs that rely on energy estimates for the strong solutions and compactness with an appropriate regularization for the weak solutions.</description>

Abstract: We prove three related quantitative results for the relative isoperimetric problem outside a convex body $\Omega$ in the plane: (1) {\L}ojasiewicz estimates and quantitative rigidity for critical points, (2) rates of convergence for the gradient flow, and (3) quantitative stability for minimizers. These results come with explicit constants and optimal exponents/rates, and hold whenever a simple two-dimensional auxiliary variational problem for circular arcs outside of $\Omega$ is nondegenerate. The proofs are inter-related, and in particular, for the first time in the context of isoperimetric problems, a flow approach is used to prove quantitative stability for minimizers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the monotonicity method for direct exact reconstruction of inclusions in the partial data Calder\'on problem, to the case of general anisotropic conductivities in any spatial dimension $d\geq 2$. From a local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map, we give reconstruction methods of inclusions based on unknown anisotropic self-adjoint perturbations to a known anisotropic conductivity coefficient. This additionally provides new insights into the non-uniqueness issues of the anisotropic Calder\'on problem.
  The main assumption is a definiteness condition for the perturbations near the outer inclusion boundaries. Beyond this condition, they are $L^\infty$-perturbations that may be indefinite away from the outer inclusion boundaries, and with no boundary regularity requirement for the inclusions. Alternatively, we allow extreme parts that are perfectly insulating or perfectly conducting, in which case we require Lipschitz regularity of the outer inclusion boundaries.</description>

Abstract: This work aims to study the rates in the context of periodic homogenization of parabolic problems with large lower order terms (both drift and potential). We demonstrate that the solution is a product of three terms: (i) a function of time, (ii) the ground-state of an exponential cell eigenvalue problem and (iii) the solution to a parabolic equation with zero effective drift. For the latter, we derive $\mathrm L^2$ rates in the homogenization limit.</description>

Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for the local boundedness of weak solutions to a broad class of nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form, under unbalanced growth conditions on the stress field. Our analysis is carried out in a non-variational setting, with no symmetry or structural assumptions on the operator. The ellipticity and growth are prescribed via distinct Young functions, leading to a Orlicz-type setting that captures a wide class of nonstandard behaviors.

      <title>Self-improving property for certain degenerate functionals with generalized Orlicz growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a self-improving property of variational integrals in a weighted framework under generalized Orlicz growth conditions. Assuming that the weight belongs to an appropriate Muckenhoupt class and the growth function satisfies standard structural conditions, we prove that the gradient of any local quasiminimizer has local higher integrability. In addition, we establish the existence of minimizers for the associated functional.</description>

      <title>Variational Principle and Stochastic Lagrangian Formulation of Viscous Hydrodynamic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we extend Constantin-Iyer's Lagrangian formulation of Navier-Stokes Equation to a wider class of hydrodynamic models. Moreover, we prove that such Lagrangian formulation is naturally derived from a stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin type variational principle. Generalized version of Kelvin circulation theorem in viscous fluids is also discussed. We also derive self-contained local well-posedness results of fluid models based on Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation using fixed point argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an elliptic equation, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, driven by a mixed type operator (the sum of the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian), involving a parametric reaction and an undetermined source term. Applying a recent abstract critical point theorem of Ricceri, we prove existence of a solution for a convenient source and small enough parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and regularity of weak solutions to the following quasilinear elliptic system: \[
  -\mathrm{div}(A_k(x, u_k) |\nabla u_k|^{p_k - 2} \nabla u_k) + \dfrac{1}{p_k} D_s A_k(x, u_k) |\nabla u_k|^{p_k} = g_k(x, u) \quad \text{in } \Omega,\quad
  u_k = 0 \quad \text{on } \partial\Omega, \]
  where $k=1,\dots,d$, $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N $ is a bounded domain with $ N \geq 2 $, $ \boldsymbol{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_d) $, $ p_k &gt; 1 $. Using tools from nonsmooth critical point theory, we prove the existence of infinitely many weak solutions in $ W_0^{1,\boldsymbol{p}}(\Omega) \cap L^\infty(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d) $, where $W_0^{1,\boldsymbol p}(\Omega)=W_0^{1,p_1}(\Omega)\times\dots\times W_0^{1,p_d}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>A limsup fast dynamo on $\mathbb{T}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a time-dependent, incompressible, and uniformly-in-time Lipschitz continuous velocity field on $\mathbb{T}^3$ that produces exponential growth of the magnetic energy along a subsequence of times, for every positive value of the magnetic diffusivity. Because this growth is not uniform in time but occurs only along a diverging sequence of times, we refer to the resulting mechanism as a limsup fast dynamo. Our construction is based on suitably rescaled Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flows, each supported on long time intervals. The analysis employs perturbation theory to establish continuity of the exponential growth rate with respect to both the initial data and the diffusivity parameter. This proves the weak form of the fast dynamo conjecture formulated by Childress and Gilbert on $\mathbb{T}^3$, but the considerably more challenging version proposed by Arnold on $\mathbb{T}^3$ remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for Singular Interacting Particle Systems Driven by Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider interacting systems particle driven by i.i.d. fractional Brownian motions, subject to irregular, possibly distributional, pairwise interactions. We show propagation of chaos and mean field convergence to the law of the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, as the number of particles $N\to\infty$, with quantitative sharp rates of order $N^{-1/2}$. Our results hold for a wide class of possibly time-dependent interactions, which are only assumed to satisfy a Besov-type regularity, related to the Hurst parameter $H\in (0,+\infty)\setminus \mathbb{N}$ of the driving noises. In particular, as $H$ decreases to $0$, interaction kernels of arbitrary singularity can be considered, a phenomenon frequently observed in regularization by noise results. Our proofs rely on a combinations of Sznitman's direct comparison argument with stochastic sewing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle with Nakano positive curvature tensor, Demailly introduced a Monge-Amp\`ere type equation. When the rank of the bundle is $1$, it becomes the usual Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In this paper, we solve this equation in the conformal class of a Nakano positive Hermitian metric.</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition under which the time-marginal law of $\mu$-reversible infinite interacting Brownian motions is characterised as the steepest gradient descent of the relative entropy in the Wasserstein space in the sense of evolution variational inequality (EVI). This is an infinite-dimensional generalisation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto/Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e theory. Consequently, the configuration space (the space of locally finite point measures) endowed with the reversible measure $\mu$ is an RCD space and the time-marginal law is identified to the heat flow on this space. Our result covers the infinite-dimensional Dyson Brownian motion with bulk and soft-edge limits; the latter yields Airy line ensemble as its stationary process, a central object in KPZ universality. Our result therefore provides an optimal transport characterisation of these models as Wasserstein gradient flows, and establishes a range of new functional inequalities (HWI, distorted Brunn-Minkowski, dimension-free Harnack and many others) as a corollary. As an application, we discover the new phenomena, dynamical number rigidity and dynamical tail triviality, that the time-marginal law possesses number rigidity and tail triviality for every time $t&gt;0$, revealing a propagation of random crystal and extremal structures by the Dyson Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Localization Method for Time-Fractional Integro-Differential Equations with Nonsmooth Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a localized numerical scheme with low regularity requirements for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations. First, a fully discrete numerical scheme is constructed. Specifically, for temporal discretization, we employ the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contours to approximate the nonlocal operators. For spatial discretization, the standard piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method (FEM) is used. We then provide a rigorous error analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy even for problems with nonsmooth/vanishing initial values or low-regularity solutions, featuring spectral accuracy in time and second-order convergence in space. Finally, a series of numerical experiments in both 1-D and 2-D validate the theoretical findings and confirm that the algorithm combines the advantages of spectral accuracy, low computational cost, and efficient memory usage.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of the JKO Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $\eta&gt;0$ a sequence of probability distributions $\rho_k^\eta$ that approximate to first order in $\eta$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $\lambda$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $\eta$. We show that $\rho_k^\eta$ are approximated to order $\eta^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a modified energy \[ J^{\eta}(\rho) = J(\rho) - \frac{\eta}{4}\int_M \Big\lVert \nabla_g \frac{\delta J}{\delta \rho} (\rho) \Big\rVert_{2}^{2} \,\rho(dx), \] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $\eta/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $\eta$ a deceleration in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{\"a}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^\eta$ we study JKO-Flow, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^\eta$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.</description>
