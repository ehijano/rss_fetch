      <title>KAN-SAM: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Guided Segment Anything Model for RGB-T Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) methods aim to identify visually significant objects by leveraging both RGB and thermal modalities to enable robust performance in complex scenarios, but they often suffer from limited generalization due to the constrained diversity of available datasets and the inefficiencies in constructing multi-modal representations. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning-based RGB-T SOD method, named KAN-SAM, which reveals the potential of visual foundational models for RGB-T SOD tasks. Specifically, we extend Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for RGB-T SOD by introducing thermal features as guiding prompts through efficient and accurate Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) adapters, which effectively enhance RGB representations and improve robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a mutually exclusive random masking strategy to reduce reliance on RGB data and improve generalization. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>UVG-VPC: Voxelized Point Cloud Dataset for Visual Volumetric Video-based Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud compression has become a crucial factor in immersive visual media processing and streaming. This paper presents a new open dataset called UVG-VPC for the development, evaluation, and validation of MPEG Visual Volumetric Video-based Coding (V3C) technology. The dataset is distributed under its own non-commercial license. It consists of 12 point cloud test video sequences of diverse characteristics with respect to the motion, RGB texture, 3D geometry, and surface occlusion of the points. Each sequence is 10 seconds long and comprises 250 frames captured at 25 frames per second. The sequences are voxelized with a geometry precision of 9 to 12 bits, and the voxel color attributes are represented as 8-bit RGB values. The dataset also includes associated normals that make it more suitable for evaluating point cloud compression solutions. The main objective of releasing the UVG-VPC dataset is to foster the development of V3C technologies and thereby shape the future in this field.</description>

      <title>A Multimedia Analytics Model for the Foundation Model Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advances in Foundation Models and agentic Artificial Intelligence are transforming multimedia analytics by enabling richer, more sophisticated interactions between humans and analytical systems. Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.</description>

      <title>L3GS: Layered 3D Gaussian Splats for Efficient 3D Scene Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional 3D content representations include dense point clouds that consume large amounts of data and hence network bandwidth, while newer representations such as neural radiance fields suffer from poor frame rates due to their non-standard volumetric rendering pipeline. 3D Gaussian splats (3DGS) can be seen as a generalization of point clouds that meet the best of both worlds, with high visual quality and efficient rendering for real-time frame rates. However, delivering 3DGS scenes from a hosting server to client devices is still challenging due to high network data consumption (e.g., 1.5 GB for a single scene). The goal of this work is to create an efficient 3D content delivery framework that allows users to view high quality 3D scenes with 3DGS as the underlying data representation. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) Creating new layered 3DGS scenes for efficient delivery, (2) Scheduling algorithms to choose what splats to download at what time, and (3) Trace-driven experiments from users wearing virtual reality headsets to evaluate the visual quality and latency. Our system for Layered 3D Gaussian Splats delivery L3GS demonstrates high visual quality, achieving 16.9% higher average SSIM compared to baselines, and also works with other compressed 3DGS representations.</description>

      <title>SoundVista: Novel-View Ambient Sound Synthesis via Visual-Acoustic Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SoundVista, a method to generate the ambient sound of an arbitrary scene at novel viewpoints. Given a pre-acquired recording of the scene from sparsely distributed microphones, SoundVista can synthesize the sound of that scene from an unseen target viewpoint. The method learns the underlying acoustic transfer function that relates the signals acquired at the distributed microphones to the signal at the target viewpoint, using a limited number of known recordings. Unlike existing works, our method does not require constraints or prior knowledge of sound source details. Moreover, our method efficiently adapts to diverse room layouts, reference microphone configurations and unseen environments. To enable this, we introduce a visual-acoustic binding module that learns visual embeddings linked with local acoustic properties from panoramic RGB and depth data. We first leverage these embeddings to optimize the placement of reference microphones in any given scene. During synthesis, we leverage multiple embeddings extracted from reference locations to get adaptive weights for their contribution, conditioned on target viewpoint. We benchmark the task on both publicly available data and real-world settings. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>kNN-SVC: Robust Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion with Additive Synthesis and Concatenation Smoothness Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness is critical in zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC). This paper introduces two novel methods to strengthen the robustness of the kNN-VC framework for SVC. First, kNN-VC's core representation, WavLM, lacks harmonic emphasis, resulting in dull sounds and ringing artifacts. To address this, we leverage the bijection between WavLM, pitch contours, and spectrograms to perform additive synthesis, integrating the resulting waveform into the model to mitigate these issues. Second, kNN-VC overlooks concatenative smoothness, a key perceptual factor in SVC. To enhance smoothness, we propose a new distance metric that filters out unsuitable kNN candidates and optimize the summing weights of the candidates during inference. Although our techniques are built on the kNN-VC framework for implementation convenience, they are broadly applicable to general concatenative neural synthesis models. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of these modifications in achieving robust SVC. Demo: http://knnsvc.com Code: https://github.com/SmoothKen/knn-svc</description>

      <title>Storybooth: Training-free Multi-Subject Consistency for Improved Visual Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training-free consistent text-to-image generation depicting the same subjects across different images is a topic of widespread recent interest. Existing works in this direction predominantly rely on cross-frame self-attention; which improves subject-consistency by allowing tokens in each frame to pay attention to tokens in other frames during self-attention computation. While useful for single subjects, we find that it struggles when scaling to multiple characters. In this work, we first analyze the reason for these limitations. Our exploration reveals that the primary-issue stems from self-attention-leakage, which is exacerbated when trying to ensure consistency across multiple-characters. This happens when tokens from one subject pay attention to other characters, causing them to appear like each other (e.g., a dog appearing like a duck). Motivated by these findings, we propose StoryBooth: a training-free approach for improving multi-character consistency. In particular, we first leverage multi-modal chain-of-thought reasoning and region-based generation to apriori localize the different subjects across the desired story outputs. The final outputs are then generated using a modified diffusion model which consists of two novel layers: 1) a bounded cross-frame self-attention layer for reducing inter-character attention leakage, and 2) token-merging layer for improving consistency of fine-grain subject details. Through both qualitative and quantitative results we find that the proposed approach surpasses prior state-of-the-art, exhibiting improved consistency across both multiple-characters and fine-grain subject details.</description>

      <title>Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have been focusing on creating datasets and developing methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent studies leverage synthetic training data via out-of-context image-caption pairs or named entity manipulations; altering names, dates, and locations. However, these approaches often produce simplistic misinformation that fails to reflect real-world complexity, limiting the robustness of detection models trained on them. Meanwhile, despite recent advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underutilized for generating diverse, realistic synthetic training data for MMD. To address this gap, we introduce "MisCaption This!", a training dataset comprising LVLM-generated miscaptioned images. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to the detection process. To optimize LAMAR, we explore different training strategies (end-to-end training and large-scale pre-training) and integration approaches (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better on real-world misinformation, while LAMAR sets new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the potential of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based approaches for advancing MMD. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of Thumbnail-Preserving Image Encryption and a New Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a primary encryption primitive balancing the privacy and searchability of cloud storage images, thumbnail preserving encryption (TPE) enables users to quickly identify the privacy personal image on the cloud and request this image from the owner through a secure channel. In this paper, we have found that two different plaintext images may produce the same thumbnail. It results in the failure of search strategy because the collision of thumbnail occurs. To address this serious security issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the collision probabilities of thumbnails, and then propose a new TPE framework, called multi-factor thumbnail preserving encryption (MFTPE). It starts from the collision probability of two blocks, extend to the probabilities of two images and ultimately to N images. Then, we in detail describe three specific MFTPE constructions preserving different combinations of factors, i.e., the sum and the geometric mean, the sum and the range, and the sum and the weighted mean. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MFTPE reduces the probability of thumbnails, exhibits strong robustness, and also effectively resists face detection and noise attacks.</description>
