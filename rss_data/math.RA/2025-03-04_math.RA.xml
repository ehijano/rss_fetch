      <title>Grothendieck rings of localizations of the integers as ordered abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}_S$ be the ring generated by the inverses of all elements of a non-empty proper subset $S$ of integer primes. We show that the ring generated by the values of unary definable sets in the model-theoretic Grothendieck ring of $(\mathbb{Z}_S;+,&lt;)$ is a quotient of $(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})[T]/(T+T^2)$, where $q$ is the largest odd integer that divides $p-1$ for all $p \notin S$.
  This implies that the Grothendieck ring of $(\mathbb{Z}_S;+,&lt;)$ is trivial in various salient cases, for example when $S$ is finite, or when $S$ does not contain any prime of the form $2^n+1$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Novikov algebra with derivation and algebra obtained from its dual operad. It turns out that the obtained dual operad has a connection with bicommutative algebras. The motivation for this work comes from the white and black Manin product of the Novikov operad with itself.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous block diagonalization of a set of symmetric matrices via congruence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies canonical forms derived from the finest simultaneous block diagonalization of a set of symmetric matrices via congruence. Our technique relies on Harrison's center theory, which is extended from a single higher degree form to multiple quadratic forms, hence a set of symmetric matrices. The algebraic structures of centers and the bijective relationship between the simultaneous block diagonalization via congruence and complete sets of orthogonal idempotents of centers are investigated. We provide an algorithm that mainly uses standard linear algebra tasks and several examples to demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, this technique can be extended verbatim to the simultaneous block diagonalization of a set of Hermitian matrices via $*$-congruence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of simultaneous direct sum decomposition of a set of multivariate polynomials. To this end, we extend Harrison's center theory for a single homogeneous polynomial to this broader setting. It is shown that the center of a set of polynomials is a special Jordan algebra, and simultaneous direct sum decompositions of the given polynomials are in bijection with complete sets of orthogonal idempotents of their center algebra. Several examples are provided to illustrate the performance of this method.</description>

      <title>Change of basis for the tridiagonal pairs of type II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tridiagonal pairs of type II. These involve two linear transformations $A$ and $A^\star$. We define two bases. In the first one, $A$ acts as a diagonal matrix while $A^\star$ acts as a block tridiagonal matrix, and in the second one, $A$ acts as a block tridiagonal matrix while $A^\star$ acts as a diagonal matrix. We obtain the change of basis coefficients between these two bases. The coefficients are special functions that are written as a nested product of polynomials that resemble Racah polynomials but involve shift operators in their expression.</description>

      <title>Deformation theory and Koszul duality for Rota-Baxter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Rota-Baxter systems in the sense of Brzezi\'nski from the perspective of operad theory. The minimal model of the Rota-Baxter system operad is constructed, equivalently a concrete construction of its Koszul dual homotopy cooperad is given. The concept of homotopy Rota-Baxter systems and the $L_\infty$-algebra that governs deformations of a Rota-Baxter system are derived from the Koszul dual homotopy cooperad. The notion of infinity-Yang-Baxter pairs is introduced, which is a higher-order generalization of the traditional Yang-Baxter pairs. It is shown that a homotopy Rota-Baxter system structure on the endomorphism algebra of a graded space is equivalent to an associative infinity-Yang-Baxter pair on this graded algebra, thereby generalizing the classical correspondence between Yang-Baxter pairs and Rota-Baxter systems.</description>

      <title>Partial Actions on Generalized Boolean Algebras with Applications to Inverse Semigroups and Combinatorial $R$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of a partial action on a generalized Boolean algebra and associate to every such system and commutative unital ring $R$ an $R$-algebra. We prove that every strongly $E^{\ast}$-unitary inverse semigroup has an associated partial action on the generalized Boolean algebra of compact open sets of tight filters in the meet semilattice of idempotents. Using these correspondences, we associate to every strongly $E^{\ast}$-unitary inverse semigroup and commutative unital ring $R$ an $R$-algebra, and show that it is isomorphic to the Steinberg algebra of the tight groupoid. As an application, we show that there is a natural unitization operation on an inverse semigroup that corresponds to a unitization of the corresponding $R$-algebra. Finally, we show that Leavitt path algebras and labelled Leavitt path algebras can be realized as the $R$-algebra associated to a strongly $E^{\ast}$-unitary inverse semigroup.</description>

      <title>A Generic Quotient of a Leavitt Path Algebra is a Leavitt Path Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete answer to the question "When is a quotient of a Leavitt path algebra isomorphic to a Leavitt path algebra?" in terms of the interaction of the kernel of the quotient homomorphism with the cycles of the digraph. A key ingredient is the characterization of finitely generated projective (Leavitt path algebra) modules whose endomorphism algebras are finite dimensional. We define a stratification and a parametrization of the ideal space of a Leavitt path algebra and show that a generic quotient of a Leavitt path algebra is a Leavitt path algebra. Along the way we show that the lattice of graded ideals of a Leavitt path algebra is a Morita invariant, hence independent of the grading. Contrary to most algebraic properties of Leavitt path algebras, our criterion for a quotient to be isomorphic to a Leavitt path algebra is not independent of the field of coefficients. We end by pointing out an intriguing connection with quantum spaces.</description>

Abstract: For a balanced pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ in an abelian category, we investigate when the chain homotopy categories ${\bf K}(\mathcal{X})$ and ${\bf K}(\mathcal{Y})$ are triangulated equivalent. To this end, we realize these chain homotopy categories as homotopy categories of certain model categories and give conditions that ensure the existence of a Quillen equivalence between the model categories in question. We further give applications to cotorsion triples, Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules, as well as pure projective and pure injective objects.</description>

      <title>Counting pairs of conics over finite fields that satisfy the Poncelet $n$-gon condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordered pair of smooth conics satisfies the Poncelet triangle condition if there is a triangle inscribed in the first conic and circumscribed in the second conic. Over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with characteristic greater than $3$, Chipalkatti showed that the density of pairs of smooth conics satisfying the Poncelet triangle condition is $\frac{1}{q}+O(q^{-2})$. We improve this result, showing that the density is exactly $\frac{q-1}{q^2-q+1}$.
  We consider the problem of determining the density of pairs of conics satisfying the Poncelet $n$-gon condition for larger $n$. We prove a corrected version of a conjecture of Chipalkatti, showing that the proportion of pairs of smooth conics satisfying the Poncelet tetragon condition is $\frac{1}{q} + O(q^{-{3/2}})$. We show that when $n$ is an odd integer coprime to $q$, the density of pairs of smooth conics satisfying this condition is $\frac{d(n)-1}{q}+O(q^{-3/2})$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. More generally, we conjecture that the density of pairs of conics satisfying the Poncelet $n$-gon condition is $d'(n)/q$ in general, where $d'(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$ not equal to $1$ or $2$. Our argument involves analyzing the $n$-torsion points on a certain elliptic curve over the function field $K = \mathbb{F}_q(\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Numerical algorithm and complexity analysis for diagonalization of multivariate homogeneous polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of a diagonalization technique for multivariate homogeneous polynomials, that is, expressing them as sums of powers of independent linear forms. It is based on Harrison's center theory and consists of a criterion and a diagonalization algorithm. Detailed formulations and computational complexity of each component of the technique are given. The complexity analysis focuses on the impacts of the number of variables and the degree of given polynomials. We show that this criterion runs in polynomial time and the diagonalization process performs efficiently in numerical experiments. Other diagonalization techniques are reviewed and compared in terms of complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove conditions ensuring that a Lie ideal or an invariant additive subgroup in a ring contains all additive commutators. A crucial assumption is that the subgroup is fully noncentral, that is, its image in every quotient is noncentral.
  For a unital algebra over a field of characteristic $\neq 2$ where every additive commutator is a sum of square-zero elements, we show that a fully noncentral subspace is a Lie ideal if and only if it is invariant under all inner automorphisms. This applies in particular to zero-product balanced algebras.</description>

      <title>Co-Kasch Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the modules $M$ every simple subfactors of which is a homomorphic image of $M$ and call them co-Kasch modules. These modules are dual to Kasch modules $M$ every simple subfactors of which can be embedded in $M$. We show that a module is co-Kasch if and only if every simple module in $\sigma[M]$ is a homomorphic image of $M$. In particular, a projective right module $P$ is co-Kasch if and only if $P$ is a generator for $\sigma[P]$. If $R$ is right max and right $H$-ring, then every right $R$-module is co-Kasch; and the converse is true for the rings whose simple right modules have locally artinian injective hulls. For a right artinian ring $R$, we prove that: (1) every finitely generated right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if every right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module if and only if $R$ is a right $H$-ring; and (2) every finitely generated projective right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if the Cartan matrix of $R$ is a diagonal matrix. For a Pr\"ufer domain $R$, we prove that, every nonzero ideal of $R$ is co-Kasch if and only if $R$ is Dedekind. The structure of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules that are co-Kasch is completely characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be a field, $H$ a Hopf algebra over $\Bbbk$, and $R = (_iM_j)_{1 \leq i,j \leq n}$ a generalized matrix algebra. In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $H$ to act partially on $R$. To achieve this, we introduce the concept of an opposite covariant pair and demonstrate that it satisfies a universal property. In the special case where $H = \Bbbk G$ is the group algebra of a group $G$, we recover the conditions given in \cite{BP} for the existence of a unital partial action of $G$ on $R$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the condition of being categorical in a tail of cardinals can be chacterized for the class of $R$-modules of the form $Add(M)$. More precisely, let $R$ be a ring and $M$ be an $R$-module which can be generated by $\leq \aleph$ elements. Then $Add(M)$ is $\kappa$-categorical in all $\kappa&gt;\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0$ if and only if $Add(M)$ is $\kappa$-categorical in some $\kappa&gt;\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0$; if and only if every $R$-module of cardinal $\kappa$ in $Add(M)$ is free for all $\kappa&gt;\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0$; if and only if every $R$-module of cardinal $(\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0)^{+}$ in $Add(M)$ is free.
  As an application, we show that the class of semisimple (or pure-projective) $R$-modules is categorical in some (all) big cardinal if and only if $R\cong M_n(D)$ where $D$ is a division ring and $n\geq 1$, partly answering an question proposed in [5].</description>

Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets in abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all fusion categories. It then extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under specific positivity constraints, encompassing all pseudo-unitary fusion categories. The primary tools employed in this study are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories.
  Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
