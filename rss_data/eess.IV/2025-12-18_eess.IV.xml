      <title>Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD): A Self-Supervised Framework for Unified Representation Learning in Gigapixel Whole-Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for the Assessment of Peritoneal Carcinosis during Diagnostic Laparoscopy for Advanced Ovarian Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage with peritoneal carcinosis (PC). Fagotti score (FS) assessment at diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) guides treatment planning by estimating surgical resectability, but its subjective and operator-dependent nature limits reproducibility and widespread use. Videos of patients undergoing DL with concomitant FS assessments at a referral center were retrospectively collected and divided into a development dataset, for data annotation, AI training and evaluation, and an independent test dataset, for internal validation. In the development dataset, FS-relevant frames were manually annotated for anatomical structures and PC. Deep learning models were trained to automatically identify FS-relevant frames, segment structures and PC, and predict video-level FS and indication to surgery (ItS). AI performance was evaluated using Dice score for segmentation, F1-scores for anatomical stations (AS) and ItS prediction, and root mean square error (RMSE) for final FS estimation. In the development dataset, the segmentation model trained on 7,311 frames, achieved Dice scores of 70$\pm$3% for anatomical structures and 56$\pm$3% for PC. Video-level AS classification achieved F1-scores of 74$\pm$3% and 73$\pm$4%, FS prediction showed normalized RMSE values of 1.39$\pm$0.18 and 1.15$\pm$0.08, and ItS reached F1-scores of 80$\pm$8% and 80$\pm$2% in the development (n=101) and independent test datasets (n=50), respectively. This is the first AI model to predict the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery providing automated FS estimation from DL videos. Its reproducible and reliable performance across datasets suggests that AI can support surgeons through standardized intraoperative tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making in AOC.</description>

      <title>Deep learning water-unsuppressed MRSI at ultra-high field for simultaneous quantitative metabolic, susceptibility and myelin water imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) maps endogenous brain metabolism while suppressing the overwhelming water signal. Water-unsuppressed MRSI (wu-MRSI) allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites, but large water sidebands cause challenges for metabolic fitting. We developed an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline to overcome these challenges at ultra-high field. Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (&lt; 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (&lt; 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans. Several metabolites such as creatine and glutamate showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF obtained from wu-MRSI and GRE showed good agreement with 0 ppm/5.5% bias and +-0.05 ppm/ +- 12.75% limits-of-agreement. Conclusion: High-quality metabolic, QSM, and MWF mapping of the human brain can be obtained simultaneously by ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T with 2 mm isotropic resolution in 12 min. WALINET+ robustly removes water sidebands while preserving metabolite signal, eliminating the need for water suppression and separate water acquisitions.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Parameterization for Direct Atomic Structure Identification in Electron Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic electron tomography (AET) enables the determination of 3D atomic structures by acquiring a sequence of 2D tomographic projection measurements of a particle and then computationally solving for its underlying 3D representation. Classical tomography algorithms solve for an intermediate volumetric representation that is post-processed into the atomic structure of interest. In this paper, we reformulate the tomographic inverse problem to solve directly for the locations and properties of individual atoms. We parameterize an atomic structure as a collection of Gaussians, whose positions and properties are learnable. This representation imparts a strong physical prior on the learned structure, which we show yields improved robustness to real-world imaging artifacts. Simulated experiments and a proof-of-concept result on experimentally-acquired data confirm our method's potential for practical applications in materials characterization and analysis with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

      <title>Meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised optic disc and cup segmentation on fundus images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression for Generative Face Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative face video coding (GFVC) is vital for modern applications like video conferencing, yet existing methods primarily focus on video motion while neglecting the significant bitrate contribution of audio. Despite the well-established correlation between audio and lip movements, this cross-modal coherence has not been systematically exploited for compression. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other. Experiments show that AVCC significantly outperforms the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance, paving the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Preprocessing for Image Compression with Pre-trained Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preprocessing is a well-established technique for optimizing compression, yet existing methods are predominantly Rate-Distortion (R-D) optimized and constrained by pixel-level fidelity. This work pioneers a shift towards Rate-Perception (R-P) optimization by, for the first time, adapting a large-scale pre-trained diffusion model for compression preprocessing. We propose a two-stage framework: first, we distill the multi-step Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a compact, one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD). Second, we perform a parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the distilled model's attention modules, guided by a Rate-Perception loss and a differentiable codec surrogate. Our method seamlessly integrates with standard codecs without any modification and leverages the model's powerful generative priors to enhance texture and mitigate artifacts. Experiments show substantial R-P gains, achieving up to a 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS on the Kodak dataset and delivering superior subjective visual quality.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Driven Quantitative Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Imaging for Segmentation and Oxygen Saturation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging can potentially estimate blood oxygenation saturation (sO2) in vivo noninvasively. However, quantitatively accurate results require accurate optical fluence estimates. Robust modeling in heterogeneous tissue, where light with different wavelengths can experience significantly different absorption and scattering, is difficult. In this work, we developed a deep neural network (Hybrid-Net) for sPA imaging to simultaneously estimate sO2 in blood vessels and segment those vessels from surrounding background tissue. sO2 error was minimized only in blood vessels segmented in Hybrid-Net, resulting in more accurate predictions. Hybrid-Net was first trained on simulated sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) representing initial pressure distributions from three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in breast tissue. Then, for experimental verification, the network was retrained on experimental sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) acquired from simple tissue mimicking phantoms with an embedded blood pool. Quantitative measures were used to evaluate Hybrid-Net performance with an averaged segmentation accuracy of &gt;= 0.978 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.998 in the experiment, and an averaged sO2 mean squared error of &lt;= 0.048 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.003 in the experiment. Overall, these results show that Hybrid-Net can provide accurate blood oxygenation without estimating the optical fluence, and this study could lead to improvements in in-vivo sO2 estimation.</description>

      <title>Nine Years of Pediatric Iris Recognition: Evidence for Biometric Permanence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biometric permanence in pediatric populations remains poorly understood despite widespread deployment of iris recognition for children in national identity programs such as India's Aadhaar and trusted traveler programs like Canada's NEXUS. This study presents a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of pediatric iris recognition, analyzing 276 subjects enrolled between ages 4-12 and followed up to nine years through adolescence. Using 18,318 near-infrared iris images acquired semi-annually, we evaluated commercial (VeriEye) and open-source (OpenIris) systems through linear mixed-effects models that disentangle enrollment age, developmental maturation, and elapsed time while controlling for image quality and physiological factors. False non-match rates remained below 0.5% across the nine-year period for both matchers using pediatric-calibrated thresholds, approaching adult-level performance. However, we reveal significant algorithm-dependent temporal behaviors: VeriEye's apparent decline reflects developmental confounding across enrollment cohorts rather than genuine template aging, while OpenIris exhibits modest but genuine temporal aging (0.5 standard deviations over eight years). Image quality and pupil dilation constancy dominated longitudinal performance, with dilation effects reaching 3.0-3.5 standard deviations, substantially exceeding temporal factors. Failures concentrated in 9.4% of subjects with persistent acquisition challenges rather than accumulating with elapsed time, confirming acquisition conditions as the primary limitation. These findings justify extending conservative re-enrollment policies, potentially to 10-12 year validity periods for high-quality enrollments at ages 7+, and demonstrate iris recognition remains viable throughout childhood and adolescence with proper imaging control.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Framework for Quality-Assured Smartphone-Based Visible Light Iris Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) offers a low-cost and accessible biometric alternative but remains a challenge due to lighting variability, pigmentation effects, and the limited adoption of standardized capture protocols. In this work, we present CUVIRIS, a dataset of 752 ISO/IEC 29794-6 compliant iris images from 47 subjects, collected with a custom Android application that enforces real-time framing, sharpness assessment, and quality feedback. We further introduce LightIrisNet, a MobileNetV3-based multi-task segmentation model optimized for on-device deployment. In addition, we adapt IrisFormer, a transformer-based matcher, to the VIS domain. We evaluate OSIRIS and IrisFormer under a standardized protocol and benchmark against published CNN baselines reported in prior work. On CUVIRIS, the open-source OSIRIS system achieves a TAR of 97.9% at FAR = 0.01 (EER = 0.76%), while IrisFormer, trained only on the UBIRIS.v2 dataset, achieves an EER of 0.057\%. To support reproducibility, we release the Android application, LightIrisNet, trained IrisFormer weights, and a subset of the CUVIRIS dataset. These results show that, with standardized acquisition and VIS-adapted lightweight models, accurate iris recognition on commodity smartphones is feasible under controlled conditions, bringing this modality closer to practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Radiomics and Clinical Features in Predictive Modelling of Brain Metastases Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain metastases affect approximately between 20% and 40% of cancer patients and are commonly treated with radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Early prediction of recurrence following treatment could enable timely clinical intervention and improve patient outcomes. This study proposes an artificial intelligence based approach for predicting brain metastasis recurrence using multimodal imaging and clinical data. A retrospective cohort of 97 patients was collected, including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquired before treatment and at first follow-up, together with relevant clinical variables. Image preprocessing included CT windowing and artifact reduction, MRI enhancement, and multimodal CT MRI registration. After applying inclusion criteria, 53 patients were retained for analysis. Radiomics features were extracted from the imaging data, and delta radiomics was employed to characterize temporal changes between pre-treatment and follow-up scans. Multiple machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated, including an analysis of discrepancies between treatment planning target volumes and delivered isodose volumes. Despite limitations related to sample size and class imbalance, the results demonstrate the feasibility of radiomics based models, namely ensemble models, for recurrence prediction and suggest a potential association between radiation dose discrepancies and recurrence risk. This work supports further investigation of AI-driven tools to assist clinical decision-making in brain metastasis management.</description>

      <title>INFORM-CT: INtegrating LLMs and VLMs FOR Incidental Findings Management in Abdominal CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.</description>

      <title>Vector Flow Imaging in Layered Models With a High Speed of Sound Contrast Using Pulse-Echo Ultrasound and Photoacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop vector flow imaging techniques for multi-layered models with a high wavespeed contrast using photoacoustic and ultrasonic imaging. We use refraction-corrected delay-and-sum image reconstruction (RC-DAS), which enforces Snell's law to accurately calculate time delays within each layer. We compare RC-DAS against conventional delay-and-sum for vector flow imaging in benchtop phantoms made of transparent polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in a water bath. We study the flow beneath a PMMA layer using two phantoms, where the PMMA layer has different shapes and thicknesses. We image a slow-moving suspension of carbon microspheres (~4 mm/s) using interleaved photoacoustic and multi-angle plane wave ultrasound acquisitions measured with a 7.6 MHz linear ultrasound array. Photoacoustic waves are generated by a 1064 nm wavelength nanosecond-pulsed laser at 50 Hz, and multi-angle plane wave ultrasound data are acquired at 100 Hz for eleven steering angles between $\pm$10$^\circ$. RC-DAS improves the flow speed accuracy, reducing the mean absolute error by 0.41-0.63 mm/s compared to the expected flow profile. The error in direction estimates improves when we use RC-DAS, with the interdecile range reducing by up to 17$^\circ$. This work emphasises the importance of refraction correction for accurate flow measurements in layered media with photoacoustics and ultrasonic imaging. While both imaging modalities can quantify flow in these multi-layered models, the modality best suited for a specific application will depend on the imaging target and flow dynamics. These techniques show promise for biomedical applications such as intraosseous and transcranial blood flow quantification, and in nondestructive testing to monitor fluid motion.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multimodal Person Recognition: A Robust Framework for Handling Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.</description>

      <title>The LUMirage: An independent evaluation of zero-shot performance in the LUMIR challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.</description>

      <title>From Pretraining to Privacy: Federated Ultrasound Foundation Model with Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical diagnosis due to its non-invasive nature and real-time capabilities. However, traditional ultrasound diagnostics relies heavily on physician expertise and is often hampered by suboptimal image quality, leading to potential diagnostic errors. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution to enhance clinical diagnosis by detecting abnormalities across various imaging modalities, existing AI methods for ultrasound face two major challenges. First, they typically require vast amounts of labeled medical data, raising serious concerns regarding patient privacy. Second, most models are designed for specific tasks, which restricts their broader clinical utility. To overcome these challenges, we present UltraFedFM, an innovative privacy-preserving ultrasound foundation model. UltraFedFM is collaboratively pre-trained using federated learning across 16 distributed medical institutions in 9 countries, leveraging a dataset of over 1 million ultrasound images covering 19 organs and 10 ultrasound modalities. This extensive and diverse data, combined with a secure training framework, enables UltraFedFM to exhibit strong generalization and diagnostic capabilities. It achieves an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.927 for disease diagnosis and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.878 for lesion segmentation. Notably, UltraFedFM surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of mid-level ultrasonographers (4-8 years of experience) and matches the performance of expert-level sonographers (10+ years of experience) in the joint diagnosis of 8 common systemic diseases.c These findings indicate that UltraFedFM can significantly enhance clinical diagnostics while safeguarding patient privacy, marking a significant advancement in AI-driven ultrasound imaging for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>MedicoSAM: Robust Improvement of SAM for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is an important analysis task in clinical practice and research. Deep learning has massively advanced the field, but current approaches are mostly based on models trained for a specific task. Training such models or adapting them to a new condition is costly due to the need for (manually) labeled data. The emergence of vision foundation models, especially Segment Anything, offers a path to universal segmentation for medical images, overcoming these issues. Here, we study how to improve Segment Anything for medical images by comparing different finetuning strategies on a large and diverse dataset. We evaluate the finetuned models on a wide range of interactive and (automatic) semantic segmentation tasks. We find that the performance can be clearly improved for interactive segmentation. However, semantic segmentation does not benefit from pretraining on medical images. Our best model, MedicoSAM, is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/medico-sam. We show that it is compatible with existing tools for data annotation and believe that it will be of great practical value.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Multimodal Medical Imaging: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging often operates under limited labeled data, especially in rare disease and low resource clinical environments. Existing multimodal and meta learning approaches improve performance in these settings but lack a theoretical explanation of why or when they succeed. This paper presents a unified theoretical framework for few shot multimodal medical imaging that jointly characterizes sample complexity, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Using PAC learning, VC theory, and PAC Bayesian analysis, we derive bounds that describe the minimum number of labeled samples required for reliable performance and show how complementary modalities reduce effective capacity through an information gain term. We further introduce a formal metric for explanation stability, proving that explanation variance decreases at an inverse n rate. A sequential Bayesian interpretation of Chain of Thought reasoning is also developed to show stepwise posterior contraction. To illustrate these ideas, we implement a controlled multimodal dataset and evaluate an additive CNN MLP fusion model under few shot regimes, confirming predicted multimodal gains, modality interference at larger sample sizes, and shrinking predictive uncertainty. Together, the framework provides a principled foundation for designing data efficient, uncertainty aware, and interpretable diagnostic models in low resource settings.</description>
