      <title>The role of Enhanced Geothermal Systems in the energy transition at Cornell -- Report of a workshop held at Cornell University, Ithaca, October 23-24, 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To review the lessons learnt from recent deep geothermal case studies and plan strategically the research, development, regulation, and communication work required for the implementation of an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) at Cornell University, a group of engineers and scholars convened a two-day workshop on the Ithaca campus, on October 23-24, 2024. The event was funded by Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. This report is a summary of the content of the presentations and discussions that took place during the workshop. The first section focuses on philosophical, sociological, economic, and regulatory questions posed by EGS deployment as a means to mitigate climate change. The second section tackles the scientific and technological research areas associated with EGS. The third section aims to assess the feasibility of developing EGS for heat direct use at Cornell University, based on results and information available to date. The report concludes with a summary of the most salient technological and scientific breakthroughs, and a plan for future technological and academic engagement in EGS projects at Cornell.</description>

      <title>DRUM: Diffusion-based runoff model for probabilistic flood forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable flood forecasting remains a critical challenge due to persistent underestimation of peak flows and inadequate uncertainty quantification in current approaches. We present DRUM (Diffusion-based Runoff Model), a generative AI solution for probabilistic runoff prediction. DRUM builds up an iterative refinement process that generates ensemble runoff estimates from noise, guided by past meteorological conditions, present meteorological forecasts, and static catchment attributes. This framework allows learning complex hydrological behaviors without imposing explicit distributional assumptions, particularly benefiting extreme event prediction and uncertainty quantification. Using data from 531 representative basins across the contiguous United States, DRUM outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods in runoff forecasting regarding both deterministic and probabilistic skills, with particular advantages in extreme flow (0.1%) predictions. DRUM demonstrates superior flood early warning skill across all magnitudes and lead times (1-7 days), achieving F1 scores near 0.4 for extreme events under perfect forecasts and maintaining robust performance with operational forecasts, especially for longer lead times and high-magnitude floods. When applied to climate projections through the 21st century, DRUM reveals increasing flood vulnerability in 47.8-57.1% of basins across emission scenarios, with particularly elevated risks along the West Coast and Southeast regions. These advances demonstrate significant potential for improving both operational flood forecasting and long-term risk assessment in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>A decade of the fast-varying ionospheric and magnetospheric magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-varying geomagnetic field is a superposition of contributions from multiple internal and external current systems. A major source of geomagnetic variations at periods less than few years are current systems external to the solid Earth, namely the ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, as well as associated mantle-induced currents. The separation of these three sources is mathematically underdetermined using either ground or satellite measurements alone, but becomes tractable when the two datasets are combined. Based on this concept, we developed a new geomagnetic field modelling approach that allows us to simultaneously characterise the mid-latitude ionospheric, magnetospheric and the internal induced magnetic fields using ground and satellite observations for all local times and magnetic conditions, and without prescribing any harmonic behaviour on these current systems in time, as is typical in other models. By applying this new method to a 10-year dataset of ground observatory and multi-satellite measurements from 2014 to 2023, we obtained the time series of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the ionospheric, magnetospheric and induced fields. These new time series unravel complex non-periodic dynamics of the external magnetic fields during global geomagnetic storms, as well as periodicities in the magnetospheric coefficients linked to solar activities and periodic ionospheric magnetic fields linked to lunar daily variations, contributing to a better picture of the dynamics of the external currents and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions. Finally, new approach provides more consistent field estimates for electromagnetic induction studies, and, owing to its flexibility and on-the-fly updates, can facilitate space weather operations.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) has gained traction in the most relevant research works and industrial applications, while also becoming involved in various fields of use. This paper offers a comprehensive review of GeoAI as a synergistic concept applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and models to geospatial data. A preliminary study is carried out, identifying the methodology of the work, the research motivations, the issues and the directions to be tracked, followed by exploring how GeoAI can be used in various interesting fields of application, such as precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster management and urban planning. Next, a statistical and semantic analysis is carried out, followed by a clear and precise presentation of the challenges facing GeoAI. Then, a concrete exploration of the future prospects is provided, based on several informations gathered during the census. To sum up, this paper provides a complete overview of the correlation between AI and the geospatial domain, while mentioning the researches conducted in this context, and emphasizing the close relationship linking GeoAI with other advanced concepts such as geographic information systems (GIS) and large-scale geospatial data, known as big geodata. This will enable researchers and scientific community to assess the state of progress in this promising field, and will help other interested parties to gain a better understanding of the issues involved.</description>
