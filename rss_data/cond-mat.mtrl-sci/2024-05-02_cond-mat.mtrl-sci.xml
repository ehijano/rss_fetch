      <title>Sensing Spin Wave Excitations by Spin Defects in Few-Layer Thick Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in wide band-gap semiconductors serve as a local sensor of multiple degrees of freedom in a variety of "hard" and "soft" condensed matter systems. Taking advantage of the recent progress on quantum sensing using van der Waals (vdW) quantum materials, here we report direct measurements of spin waves excited in magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) by boron vacancy $V_B^-$ spin defects contained in few-layer thick hexagonal boron nitride nanoflakes. We show that the ferromagnetic resonance and parametric spin excitations can be effectively detected by $V_B^-$ spin defects under various experimental conditions through optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. The off-resonant dipole interaction between YIG magnons and $V_B^-$ spin defects is mediated by multi-magnon scattering processes, which may find relevant applications in a range of emerging quantum sensing, computing, and metrology technologies. Our results also highlight the opportunities offered by quantum spin defects in layered two-dimensional vdW materials for investigating local spin dynamic behaviors in magnetic solid-state matters.</description>

      <title>Hundness and band renormalization in the kagome antiferromagnets Mn$_3X$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may lead to novel exotic quantum phenomena with potential applications. First-principles calculations are critical for guiding the experimental discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the antiferromagnetic kagome lattice Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge), which exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal a crucial role of the Hund's rule coupling on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and topological properties: (1) the establishment of noncollinear antiferromagnetic orders, (2) the weakly renormalized bands in excellent agreement with ARPES, and (3) a sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes beyond previous expectations. Our work provides a basis for understanding the topological properties of Mn$_3X$ and challenges previous experimental interpretations based on incorrect band structures.</description>

      <title>Understanding the phase stability in multi-principal-component AlCuFeMn alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Method(s) that can reliably predict phase evolution across thermodynamic parameter space, especially in complex systems are of critical significance in academia as well as in the manufacturing industry. In the present work, phase stability in equimolar AlCuFeMn multi-principal-component alloy (MPCA) was predicted using complementary first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Temperature evolution of completely disordered, partially ordered, and completely ordered phases was examined based on Gibbs free energy. Configurational, electronic, vibrational, and lattice mismatch entropies were considered to compute the Gibbs free energy of the competing phases. Additionally, elemental segregation was studied using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The predicted results at 300K align well with room-temperature experimental observations using x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy on a sample prepared using commercially available pure elements. The adopted method could help in predicting plausible phases in other MPCA systems with complex phase stability.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Interface Magnetism in Fe/Alq3 Bilayer Structure; Thickness-Dependent Interface Resolved Studies Under X-Ray Standing Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, interfacial magnetism at metal organic interface is probed using an isotope sensitive interface resolved nuclear resonance scattering technique which is made depth selective under x-rays standing wave conditions. Using GIWAXS and GINRS measurements, this study evidences the presence of symmetry-based PMA which appears at a lower thickness of Fe having distortion in cubic symmetry and disappears at a higher thickness of Fe as its cubic symmetry retains. The non-zero value of quadrupole splitting evidences the strain at the interfacial region which on increasing thickness of Fe relaxes. The diffusion of Fe is traced using XRF and NRR, deep penetration of Fe in Alq3 layer due to soft nature of the organic film is obtained. This thickness-dependent study enables us to understand the magnetic behavior of buried ferromagnetic metal in the vicinity of organic molecules.</description>

      <title>An eco-friendly passivation strategy of resveratrol for highly efficient and antioxidative perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of perovskite solar cells is closely related to the defects in perovskite crystals, and there are a large number of crystal defects in the perovskite thin films prepared by the solution method, which is not conducive to the commercial production of PSCs. In this study, resveratrol(RES), a green natural antioxidant abundant in knotweed and grape leaves, was introduced into perovskite films to passivate the defect. RES achieves defect passivation by interacting with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite films. The results show that the quality of the perovskite film is significantly improved, and the energy level structure of the device is optimized, and the power conversion efficiency of the device is increased from 21.62% to 23.44%. In addition, RES can hinder the degradation of perovskite structures by O2- and CO2- free radicals, and the device retained 88% of its initial PCE after over 1000 hours in pure oxygen environment. The device retains 91% of the initial PCE after more than 1000 hours at 25{\deg}C and 50+5% relative humidity. This work provides a strategy for the use of natural and environmentally friendly additives to improve the efficiency and stability of devices, and provides an idea for the development of efficient, stable and environmentally friendly PSCs.</description>

      <title>Optically detected magnetic resonance study of thermal effects due to absorbing environment around nitrogen-vacancy-nanodiamond powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implanted Fe$^+$ ions in nanodiamond (ND) powder containing negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers and studied their Raman spectra and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in various applied magnetic fields with green light (532 nm) excitation. In Raman spectra, we observed a blue shift of the NV$^-$ peak associated with the conversion of the electronic sp$^3$ configuration to the disordered sp$^2$ one typical for the carbon/graphite structure. In the ODMR spectra, we observed a red shift of the resonance position caused by local heating by an absorptive environment that recovers after annealing. To reveal the red shift mechanism in ODMR, we created a controlled absorptive environment around ND by adding iron-based Fe$_2$O$_3$ and graphitic sp$^2$ powders to the ND suspension. This admixture caused a substantial increase in the observed shift proportional to the applied laser power, corresponding to an increase in the local temperature by 150-180 K. This surprisingly large shift is absent in non-irradiated NV-ND powders, is associated only with the modification of the local temperature by the absorptive environment of NV-NDs and can be studied using ODMR signals of NV$^-$.</description>

      <title>A matter of performance &amp; criticality: a review of rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low efficiency of conventional liquefaction technologies based on the Joule-Thomson expansion makes liquid hydrogen currently not attractive enough for large-scale energy-related technologies that are important for the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction has great potential to achieve higher efficiency and is therefore a crucial enabler for affordable liquid hydrogen. Cost-effective magnetocaloric materials with large magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in the temperature range of 77 $\sim$ 20 K under commercially practicable magnetic fields are the foundation for the success of magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. Heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds generally show excellent magnetocaloric performances, but the heavy rare-earth elements (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) are highly critical in resources. Yttrium and light rare-earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) are relatively abundant, but their alloys generally show less excellent magnetocaloric properties. A dilemma appears: higher performance or lower criticality? In this review, we study how cryogenic temperature influences magnetocaloric performance by first reviewing heavy rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds. Next, we look at light rare-earth-based, "mixed" rare-earth-based, and Gd-based intermetallic compounds with the nature of the phase transition order taken into consideration, and summarize ways to resolve the dilemma.</description>

      <title>Optimization of reactively sputtered Mn3GaN films based on resistivity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn-based nitrides with antiperovskite structures have several properties that can be utilised for antiferromagnetic spintronics. Their magnetic properties depend on the structural quality, composition and doping of the cubic antiperovskite structure. Such nitride thin films are usually produced by reactive physical vapour deposition, where the deposition rate of N can only be controlled by the N2 gas flow. We show that the tuning of the N content can be optimised using low temperature resistivity measurements, which serve as an indicator of the degree of structural disorder. Several Mn3GaNx films were prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering under different N2 gas flows. Under optimised conditions, we obtain films that exhibit a metal-like temperature dependence, a vanishing logarithmic increase in resistivity towards zero, the highest resistivity ratio and a lattice contraction of 0.4 % along the growth direction when heated above that of the N\'eel temperature in agreement with the bulk samples.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Room-Temperature Electric Field Reversal of Magnetization in the Family of $A_4B_3$O$_9$ Layered Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of a strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in a multiferroic (MF) material is not only of fundamental interest, but also forms the basis of next generation memory devices where the direction of magnetization can be reversed by an external electric field. Using group-theory led first-principles calculations, we determine the ME properties of a relatively understudied family of layered oxides with the general formula $A_4B_3$O$_9$. We show how the tetrahedral rotations in these oxides can lead to a variety of hitherto unknown structural phases with different symmetries. In particular, a polar phase in the $Cmc2_1$ space group has been identified where a weak ferromagnetic mode arises spontaneously via a canting of the antiferromagnetically ordered $B$-site spins. In this polar phase, the polar mode couples to the magnetic modes through a rare $\Gamma$-point ME-MF coupling scheme such that the net magnetization can be directly reversed by an electric field switching of the polar mode. Moreover, in agreement with previous experimental observations, we predict room-temperature magnetism in $A_4B_3$O$_9$ layered oxides which is supported by our calculations of the magnetic exchange interaction parameters, further indicating the potential of these compounds in practical technological applications.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised identification of local atomic environment from atomistic potential descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing local structures effectively is key to unraveling the origin of many physical phenomena. Unsupervised algorithms offer an effective way of handling systems in which order parameters are unknown or computationally expensive. By combining novel unsupervised algorithm (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection) with atomistic potential descriptors, we distinguish between various chemical environments with minimal computational overhead. In particular, we apply this method to silicon and water systems. The algorithm effectively distinguishes between solid structures and phases of silicon, including solid and liquid phases, and accurately identifies interstitial, monovacancy, and surface atoms in diamond structures. In the case of water, it is capable of identifying an ice nucleus in the liquid phase, demonstrating its applicability in nucleation studies.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for efficient carrier multiplication in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier multiplication (CM), where the absorption of a single photon results in the generation of several electron-hole pairs via impact ionization, plays a pivotal role in the quest for enhancing the performance of solar cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. The combination of its narrow bandgap relative to the photon energy of visible light, along with its low phonon frequencies that hinder efficient energy dissipation into phonons, makes the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ an optimal candidate material for efficient CM. Here we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to trace the number of electron-hole pairs after photoexcitation of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with visible pump pulses at $\hbar\omega=2$ eV. We find that both the number of electrons inside the conduction band as well as the number of holes inside the valence band keep increasing long after the pump pulse is gone, providing direct evidence for CM. We also analyze the transient band structure as well as the hot carrier dynamics inside the conduction band, providing a complete picture of the non-equilibrium carrier dynamics in photoexcited Bi$_2$Se$_3$ which can now serve as a basis for novel optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyzes of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to the axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyzes without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a formation of an axisymmetric spike singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire pinch-off and separation into a disjoint segments. The scaling analysis of the amplitude spike singularity is performed, and the time-and-electric field-dependent dimensions of the spike are characterized. A weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time-and-electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>k-resolved ultrafast light-induced band renormalization in monolayer WS$_2$ on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials is crucial for their potential applications in nano- and optoelectronics. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS$_2$ have garnered significant interest due to their strong light-matter interaction and extreme sensitivity of the band structure to the presence of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In this study, we investigate the transient electronic structure of monolayer WS$_2$ on a graphene substrate after resonant excitation of the A-exciton using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a pronounced band structure renormalization including a substantial reduction of the transient band gap that is in good quantitative agreement with our {\it ab initio} theory that reveals the importance of both intrinsic WS$_2$ and extrinsic substrate contributions to the transient band structure of monolayer WS$_2$. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of band structure dynamics in two-dimensional materials but also offer valuable insights for the development of novel electronic and optoelectronic devices based on monolayer TMDs and their heterostructures with graphene.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved profile of the interfacial ferromagnetism in $CaMnO_{3}/CaRuO_{3}$ superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent magnetic phenomena at interfaces represent a frontier in materials science, pivotal for advancing technologies in spintronics and magnetic storage. In this letter, we utilize a suite of advanced X-ray spectroscopic and scattering techniques to investigate emergent interfacial ferromagnetism in oxide superlattices comprised of antiferromagnetic CaMnO3 and paramagnetic CaRuO3. Our findings challenge prior theoretical models by demonstrating that the ferromagnetism extends beyond the interfacial layer into multiple unit cells of CaMnO3 and exhibits an asymmetric profile. Complementary density functional calculations reveal that the interfacial ferromagnetism is driven by the double exchange mechanism, facilitated by charge transfer from Ru to Mn ions. Additionally, defect chemistry, particularly the presence of oxygen vacancies, likely plays a crucial role in modifying the magnetic moments at the interface, leading to the observed asymmetry between the top and bottom CaMnO3 interfacial magnetic layers. Our findings underscore the potential of manipulating interfacial ferromagnetism through point defect engineering.</description>

      <title>A Python code for calculating the mean-value (Baldereschi's) point for any crystal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A python code (mvp.py) is presented for computing the mean-value point (MVP) in the Brillouin zone first introduced by Baldereschi [1]. The code allows calculations of the MVP for any input crystal structure. Having MVP allows approximating the Brillouin zone integrals of relatively smooth, periodic functions defined in the reciprocal space by the value of the same function at only one, mean-value, k-point. This approximation decreases computational cost at a relatively small decrease in accuracy. The MVP coordinates for the 14 Bravais lattices are evaluated and the underlying theory is discussed.</description>

      <title>Excitation-Dependent Features and Artifacts in 2-D Terahertz Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) has attracted increasing attention for studying complex solids. A number of recent studies have applied 2DTS either with long pulses or away from any material resonances, situations that yield unconventional 2DTS spectra that are often difficult to interpret. Here, we clarify the generic origins of observed spectral features by examining 2DTS spectra of ZnTe, a model system with a featureless optical susceptibility at low terahertz frequencies. These results also reveal possible artifacts that may arise from electro-optic sampling in collinear 2DTS experiments, including the observation of spurious rectified or second harmonic signals.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium carrier dynamics and band structure of graphene on 2D tin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with Sn results in a well-ordered 2D metallic Sn phase with a $(1\times1)$ structure at the interface between SiC substrate and quasi-freestanding graphene. The 2D\,Sn phase exhibits exotic electronic properties with Dirac-like and flat bands coexisting close to the Fermi level that exhibit both Zeeman- and Rashba-type spin splittings. Possible inter-layer interactions between the 2D\,Sn layer and graphene that may result in emerging electronic properties remain unexplored. We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal a surprisingly short-lived non-equilibrium carrier distribution inside the Dirac cone of graphene. Further, we find that the graphene $\pi$-band exhibits a transient down-shift that we attribute to charging of the graphene layer with holes. We interpret our results with support from density functional theory calculations of the graphene - 2D\,Sn heterostructure that reveal a substantial hybridization between graphene $\pi$-band and Sn $p_z$-states that opens up a $\sim230$\,meV band gap inside the Dirac cone and delocalizes the charge carriers over both the graphene and 2D\,Sn layers. Our results have important implications for the design of future ultrafast optoelectronic devices that may find applications in the fields of light harvesting and detection, as supercapacitors, or in novel quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Nutation: separating the spin from its magnetic moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nearly 90 years, precession and relaxation processes have been thought to dominate magnetization dynamics. Only recently has it been considered that, on short time scales, an inertia-driven magnetization dynamics should become relevant, leading to additional nutation of the magnetization vector. Here, we trigger magnetic nutation via a sudden excitation of a thin Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) film with an ultrashort optical pulse, that leads to an abrupt tilting of the effective field acting on the magnetic moments, separating the dynamics of the magnetization from that of its angular momentum. We investigate the resulting magnetization dynamics in the inertial regime experimentally by the time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect. We find a characteristic oscillation in the Kerr signal in the range of about 0.1 THz superimposed on the precessional oscillations with GHz frequencies. By comparison with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that this observation cannot be explained by the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion but can be attributed to inertial contributions leading to nutation of the magnetization vector around its angular momentum. Hence, an optical and non-resonant excitation of inertial magnetization dynamics can trigger and control different magnetic processes, ranging from demagnetization via nutation to precession in a single device. These findings will have profound implications for the understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and magnetization switching.</description>

      <title>Anomalous phonon Gr\"uneisen parameters in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain tuning is a powerful experimental method in probing correlated electron systems. Here we study the strain response of the lattice dynamics and electronic structure in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ by polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy. We observe an increase of the size of the direct semiconducting band gap. Although the majority of the optical phonons show only marginal dependence to applied strain, the frequency of the two B$_{2g}$ phonon modes, which have quadrupolar symmetry and already anomalously soften on cooling under zero strain, increases significantly with tensile strain along the $a$ axis. The corresponding Gr\"uneisen parameters are unusually large in magnitude and negative in sign. These effects are well captured by first-principles density functional theory calculations and indicate close proximity of Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ to a structural instability, similar to that encountered in excitonic insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional quantum oscillations and evidence of non-trivial electronic states in quasi-two-dimensional electron system at complex oxide interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous occurrence of electric-field controlled superconductivity and spin-orbit interaction makes two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) constructed from perovskite transition metal oxides promising candidates for the next generation of spintronics and quantum computing. It is, however, essential to understand the electronic bands thoroughly and verify the predicted electronic states experimentally in these 2DES to advance technological applications. Here, we present novel insights into the electronic states of the 2DES at oxide interfaces through comprehensive investigations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in two different systems: EuO/KTaO$_3$ (EuO/KTO) and LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO). To accurately resolve these oscillations, we conducted transport measurements in high magnetic fields up to 60 T and low temperatures down to 100 mK. For 2D confined electrons at both interfaces, we observed a progressive increase of oscillations frequency and cyclotron mass with the magnetic field. We interpret these intriguing findings by considering the existence of non-trivial electronic bands, for which the $E-k$ dispersion incorporates both linear and parabolic dispersion relations. In addition to providing experimental evidence for topological-like electronic states in KTO-2DES and STO-2DES, the unconventional oscillations presented in this study establish a new paradigm for quantum oscillations in 2DES based on perovskite transition metal oxides, where the oscillations frequency exhibits quadratic dependence on the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure in a rare-earth based nodal-line semimetal candidate PrSbTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE) based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics. Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized 4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06179v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress towards universal machine-learned interatomic potentials holds considerable promise for materials discovery. Yet the accuracy of these potentials for predicting phase stability may still be limited. In contrast, cluster expansions provide accurate phase stability predictions but are computationally demanding to parameterize from first principles, especially for structures of low dimension or with a large number of components, such as interfaces or multimetal catalysts. We overcome this trade-off via transfer learning. Using Bayesian inference, we incorporate prior statistical knowledge from machine-learned and physics-based potentials, enabling us to sample the most informative configurations and to efficiently fit first-principles cluster expansions. This algorithm is tested on Pt:Ni, showing robust convergence of the mixing energies as a function of sample size with reduced statistical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of Recombination-Enhanced Migration of an Interstitial Magnesium in Gallium Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stable and metastable configurations of interstitial Mg in GaN and its migration energy barriers are studied from first-principles calculations. In addition to the conventional octahedral (O, global energy minimum) and tetrahedral (T, metastable) interstitial sites, we discover two new metastable interstitial complexes with formation energy lower than or close to that of T configuration but higher than O. Except for Mg at O site which only has +2 charge state, all other configurations also permit charge states +1 or 0. The minimum migration energy barrier for Mg$^{++}$ between O sites is found to be 1.95 eV. We further find that, when Fermi energy is close to the conduction band, the migration between O sites via metastable configurations occur through a recombination-enhanced mechanism in which the charge state changes from +2 at O site to 0 at metastable sites by consecutive capture of two electrons during the migration. This process greatly reduces the migration energy barrier to as low as 1.47 eV. This value is consistent with experiments, and we also discuss the role of intrinsic defects in the migration of Mg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CdTe and its alloy CdTeSe are widely used in optoelectronic devices, such as radiation detectors and solar cells, due to their superior electrical properties. However, the formation of defects and defect complexes in these materials can significantly affect their performance. As a result, understanding the defect formation and recombination processes in CdTe and CdTeSe alloy is of great importance. In recent years, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the properties of defects in semiconductors. In this paper, we use DFT+U calculations to comprehensively study the properties of intrinsic defects as well as extrinsic defects induced by commonly used dopants, such as Cu and group V elements, in CdTe and CdTeSe alloy. This work provides insights into the effects of these defects on the electrical and optical properties of the material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical A-site cation substitution has advanced the stability and efficiency of hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites solar cells and the functionality of X-ray detectors. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms underpinning their unique performance remain elusive. This multi-modal study unveils the link between nanoscale structural dynamics and macroscopic optoelectronic properties in these materials by utilising X-ray diffuse scattering, inelastic neutron spectroscopy and optical microscopy complemented by state-of-the-art machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach uncovers the presence of dynamic, lower-symmetry local nanodomains embedded within the higher-symmetry average phase in various perovskite compositions. The properties of these nanodomains are tunable via the A-site cation selection: methylammonium induces a high density of anisotropic, planar nanodomains of out-of-phase octahedral tilts, while formamidinium favours sparsely distributed isotropic, spherical nanodomains with in-phase tilting, even when crystallography reveals cubic symmetry on average. The observed variations in the properties of dynamic nanodomains are in agreement with our simulations and are directly linked to the differing macroscopic optoelectronic and ferroelastic behaviours of these compositions. By demonstrating the influence of A-site cation on local nanodomains and consequently, on macroscopic properties, we propose leveraging this relationship to engineer the optoelectronic response of these materials, propelling further advancements in perovskite-based photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and X-ray imaging.</description>

Abstract: Chiral magnets are materials which possess unique helical arrangements of magnetic moments, which give rise to nonreciprocal transport and fascinating physics phenomena. On the one hand, their exploration is guided by the prospects of unconventional signal processing, computation schemes and magnetic memory. On the other hand, progress in applications is hindered by the challenging materials synthesis, limited scalability and typically low critical temperature. Here, we report the creation and exploration of artificial chiral magnets (ACMs) at room temperature. By employing a mass production compatible deposition technology, we synthesize ACMs, which consist of helical Ni surfaces on central cylinders. Using optical microscopy, we reveal nonreciprocal magnon transport at GHz frequencies. It is controlled by programmable toroidal moments which result from the ACM's geometrical handedness and field-dependent spin chirality. We present materials-by-design rules which optimize the helically curved ferromagnets for 3D nonreciprocal transport at room temperature and zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Universality and the thermoelectric transport properties of a double quantum dot system: Seeking for conditions that improve the thermoelectric efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing universal relations for the Onsager coefficients in the linear regime at the symmetric point of the single impurity Anderson model, we calculate the conditions under which the quantum scattering phase shift should satisfy to produce the asymptotic Carnot's limit for the thermoelectric efficiency. We show that a single quantum dot connected by metallic leads at the Kondo regime cannot achieve the conditions that cause the best thermoelectric efficiency. We study a system of serial double quantum dots without inter-dot correlations. We show that maintaining one dot in the electron-hole symmetric point makes it possible to obtain conditions for the quantum phase shift linked to charge fluctuations in the other quantum dot that satisfy the conditions associated with enhancing the thermoelectric efficiency. We also discuss the presence of bound states in the continuum (BICs) and quasi-BICs associated with the quantum scattering interference process that improves thermoelectric efficiency. We identify two types of quasi-BICs that occur at low and high temperatures: The first is associated with single Fano resonances, and the last is with several Fano processes. We also discussed possible temperature values and conditions that could be linked with the experimental realization of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate relationship between Fermi surface (FS) and electron transport in materials is crucial for advancing our knowledge of condensed matter physics. Commonly, FS properties are used to predict current within the framework of Fermi-liquid theory, where locally on the FS electron behavior can be estimated by nearly free election gas with slowly switched-on interactions. In this study, we go beyond the limits of this theory and explore how the geometry of the FS can result in strongly correlated Fermi-liquid or non-Fermi liquid electron behavior in metals and semi-metals and consequent anomalous transport effects: firstly, we establish that a semi-metallic FS with non-zero genus signals Fermi liquid breakdown, expanding our understanding of FS topology (Lemma 1). Secondly, we explicitly give dispersion relation in the form of a general polynomial of degree $2n, n \ge 2$, which generates $n$ hole in the Fermi surface (Lemma 2). Additionally, we propose that hyperbolicity of the spinless FS leads to spin-correlated transport, offering insights into the implementation of the spin degree of freedom into the complexification of the reciprocal space(Proposition 1). These results deepen our understanding of FS geometry's impact on electronic behaviors, providing a theoretical foundation for the further development of a novel geometrized theoretical formalism of anomalous quantum transport within a semiclassical approach.</description>

Abstract: We observe strongly anisotropic third-harmonic generation mediated by resonant sum-frequency driving of Raman phonons with THz light, extending light-induced dual control of structural and optical properties in solids. Either strong enhancement or strong suppression of the third harmonic covering six orders of magnitude can be achieved, a result of interference between purely electronic and phonon-mediated contributions to the polarization field. These findings enrich capabilities for tailoring nonlinear optics via phononics and for the spectroscopy of crystalline structural dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate disordered-driven transitions between trivial and topological insulator (TI) phases in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Our study primarily focuses on the BHZ model with Anderson disorder, while other standard 2DTI models exhibit equivalent features. The analysis is based on the local Chern marker (LCM), a local quantity that allows for the characterization of topological transitions in finite and disordered systems. Our simulations indicate that disorder-driven trivial to topological insulator transitions are nicely characterized by $\mathcal{C}_0$, the disorder averaged LCM near the central cell of the system. We show that $\mathcal{C}_0$ is characterized by a single-parameter scaling, namely, $\mathcal{C}_0(M, W, L) \equiv \mathcal{C}_0(z)$ with $z = [W^\mu-W_c^\mu(M)]L$, where $M$ is the Dirac mass, $W$ is the disorder strength and $L$ is the system size, while $W_c(M) \propto \sqrt{M}$ and $\mu \approx 2$ stand for the critical disorder strength and critical exponent, respectively. Our numerical results are in agreement with a theoretical prediction based on a first-order Born approximation (1BA) analysis. These observations lead us to speculate that the universal scaling function we have found is rather general for amorphous and disorder-driven topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Discovery of universal phonon thermal Hall effect in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02863</link>

Abstract: Thermal Hall effect (THE) in insulator is a remarkable phenomenon that arises from the motion of chargeless quasi-particles under a magnetic field. While magnons or exotic spin excitations were considered as the origin of THE in some magnetic materials, there are more and more evidences suggesting that phonons play a significant role. However, the mechanism behind phonon THE is still unknown. Here we report the observation of THE, including planar THE, in a broad range of non-magnetic insulators and semiconductors: SrTiO3, SiO2 (quartz), MgO, MgAl2O4, Si and Ge. While the presence of antiferrodistortive domains in SrTiO3 and chiral phonons in SiO2 may complicate the interpretation of THE, the striking observations of THE in trivial insulators MgO and MgAl2O4, as well as in high-purity intrinsic semiconductors Si and Ge, demonstrate that phonon THE is a universal property of crystals. Without other effects on phonons such as from magnons, this universal phonon THE is characterized by a scaling law of |\k{appa}_xy| ~ \k{appa}_xx^2. Our results experimentally discover a fundamental physics of phonons in magnetic field, which should come from the direct coupling between atom vibrations and the field. Starting from this universal phonon THE in crystals, all previous interpretations of THE in magnetic or non-magnetic materials need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>Record Acceleration of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model Using High-Performance Wafer Scale Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The versatility and wide-ranging applicability of the Ising model, originally introduced to study phase transitions in magnetic materials, have made it a cornerstone in statistical physics and a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of emerging computer hardware. Here, we present a novel implementation of the two-dimensional Ising model on a Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), a revolutionary processor that is opening new frontiers in computing. In our deployment of the checkerboard algorithm, we optimized the Ising model to take advantage of the unique WSE architecture. Specifically, we employed a compressed bit representation storing 16 spins on each int16 word, and efficiently distributed the spins over the processing units enabling seamless weak scaling and limiting communications to only immediate neighboring units. Our implementation can handle up to 754 simulations in parallel, achieving an aggregate of over 61.8 trillion flip attempts per second for Ising models with up to 200 million spins. This represents a gain of up to 148 times over previously reported single-device with a highly optimized implementation on NVIDIA V100 and up to 88 times in productivity compared to NVIDIA H100. Our findings highlight the significant potential of the WSE in scientific computing, particularly in the field of materials modeling.</description>

      <title>A general framework for active space embedding methods: applications in quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding approaches based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion algorithm are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties of the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in the position of the main absorption band, the method demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the excellent agreement with the experimental photoluminescence emission peak.</description>
