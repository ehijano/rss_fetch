      <title>MetaCompass: Reference-guided Assembly of Metagenomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metagenomic studies have primarily relied on de novo assembly for reconstructing genes and genomes from microbial mixtures. While reference-guided approaches have been employed in the assembly of single organisms, they have not been used in a metagenomic context. Here we describe the first effective approach for reference-guided metagenomic assembly that can complement and improve upon de novo metagenomic assembly methods for certain organisms. Such approaches will be increasingly useful as more genomes are sequenced and made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Graph-based variant discovery reveals novel dynamics in the human microbiome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence differences between the strains of bacteria comprising host-associated and environmental microbiota may play a role in community assembly and influence the resilience of microbial communities to disturbances. Tools for characterizing strain-level variation within microbial communities, however, are limited in scope, focusing on just single nucleotide polymorphisms, or relying on reference-based analyses that miss complex functional and structural variants. Here, we demonstrate the power of assembly graph analysis to detect and characterize structural variants in almost 1,000 metagenomes generated as part of the Human Microbiome Project. We identify over nine million variants comprising insertion/deletion events, repeat copy-number changes, and mobile elements such as plasmids. We highlight some of the potential functional roles of these genomic changes. Our analysis revealed striking differences in the rate of variation across body sites, highlighting niche-specific mechanisms of bacterial adaptation. The structural variants we detect also include potentially novel prophage integration events, highlighting the potential use of graph-based analyses for phage discovery.</description>

      <title>Advancing Gene Selection in Oncology: A Fusion of Deep Learning and Sparsity for Precision Gene Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene selection plays a pivotal role in oncology research for improving outcome prediction accuracy and facilitating cost-effective genomic profiling for cancer patients. This paper introduces two gene selection strategies for deep learning-based survival prediction models. The first strategy uses a sparsity-inducing method while the second one uses importance based gene selection for identifying relevant genes. Our overall approach leverages the power of deep learning to model complex biological data structures, while sparsity-inducing methods ensure the selection process focuses on the most informative genes, minimizing noise and redundancy. Through comprehensive experimentation on diverse genomic and survival datasets, we demonstrate that our strategy not only identifies gene signatures with high predictive power for survival outcomes but can also streamlines the process for low-cost genomic profiling. The implications of this research are profound as it offers a scalable and effective tool for advancing personalized medicine and targeted cancer therapies. By pushing the boundaries of gene selection methodologies, our work contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts in cancer genomics, promising improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-VAE: Curvature regularized variational autoencoders for uncovering emergent low dimensional geometric structure in high dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems with emergent behaviors often organize along low-dimensional subsets of high-dimensional spaces. For example, despite the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome, the principled study of genomics is fruitful because biological processes rely on coordinated organization that results in lower dimensional phenotypes. To uncover this organization, many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have successfully embedded high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces by preserving local similarities between data points. However, the nonlinearities in these methods allow for too much curvature to preserve general trends across multiple non-neighboring data clusters, thereby limiting their interpretability and generalizability to out-of-distribution data. Here, we address both of these limitations by regularizing the curvature of manifolds generated by variational autoencoders, a process we coin ``$\Gamma$-VAE''. We demonstrate its utility using two example data sets: bulk RNA-seq from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx); and single cell RNA-seq from a lineage tracing experiment in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. We find that the resulting regularized manifolds identify mesoscale structure associated with different cancer cell types, and accurately re-embed tissues from completely unseen, out-of distribution cancers as if they were originally trained on them. Finally, we show that preserving long-range relationships to differentiated cells separates undifferentiated cells -- which have not yet specialized -- according to their eventual fate. Broadly, we anticipate that regularizing the curvature of generative models will enable more consistent, predictive, and generalizable models in any high-dimensional system with emergent low-dimensional behavior.</description>

      <title>Double trouble: Predicting new variant counts across two heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collecting genomics data across multiple heterogeneous populations (e.g., across different cancer types) has the potential to improve our understanding of disease. Despite sequencing advances, though, resources often remain a constraint when gathering data. So it would be useful for experimental design if experimenters with access to a pilot study could predict the number of new variants they might expect to find in a follow-up study: both the number of new variants shared between the populations and the total across the populations. While many authors have developed prediction methods for the single-population case, we show that these predictions can fare poorly across multiple populations that are heterogeneous. We prove that, surprisingly, a natural extension of a state-of-the-art single-population predictor to multiple populations fails for fundamental reasons. We provide the first predictor for the number of new shared variants and new total variants that can handle heterogeneity in multiple populations. We show that our proposed method works well empirically using real cancer and population genetics data.</description>

      <title>ProSt: computing, storing and visualizing attributes of prokaryotic genomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prokaryotic organisms usually possess compact genomes, which are particularly suitable to complete sequencing with existing technologies, which led to an escalating accumulation of available genome data. In response to this ever-expanding repository of information, we introduce ProSt, a computational system designed for the batch computation, storage, and interactive visualization of the values of attributes of prokaryotic genomes. The system allows for parallel attribute value batch computation, dynamically designed to incrementally integrate new attribute values as additional genomes become available.
  ProSt is flexible permitting the definition of attributes by implementing attribute value computation plugins, supporting several languages (Python, Nim, Rust and Bash). This allows the system to continually evolve in accordance with changing research needs and developments. Additionally, our computation and storage systems maintain comprehensive metadata, thereby enabling data provenance tracking for the computed attribute values.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on survival modeling with applications to omics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Identification of genomic, molecular and clinical markers prognostic of patient survival is important for developing personalized disease prevention, diagnostic and treatment approaches. Modern omics technologies have made it possible to investigate the prognostic impact of markers at multiple molecular levels, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, and how these potential risk factors complement clinical characterization of patient outcomes for survival prognosis. However, the massive sizes of the omics data sets, along with their correlation structures, pose challenges for studying relationships between the molecular information and patients' survival outcomes. Results: We present a general workflow for survival analysis that is applicable to high-dimensional omics data as inputs when identifying survival-associated features and validating survival models. In particular, we focus on the commonly used Cox-type penalized regressions and hierarchical Bayesian models for feature selection in survival analysis, which are are especially useful for high-dimensional data, but the framework is applicable more generally. Availability and implementation: A step-by-step R tutorial using The Cancer Genome Atlas survival and omics data for the execution and evaluation of survival models has been made available at https://ocbe-uio.github.io/survomics/survomics.html.</description>

      <title>Second-order group knockoffs with applications to GWAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional testing via the knockoff framework allows one to identify -- among large number of possible explanatory variables -- those that carry unique information about an outcome of interest, and also provides a false discovery rate guarantee on the selection. This approach is particularly well suited to the analysis of genome wide association studies (GWAS), which have the goal of identifying genetic variants which influence traits of medical relevance.
  While conditional testing can be both more powerful and precise than traditional GWAS analysis methods, its vanilla implementation encounters a difficulty common to all multivariate analysis methods: it is challenging to distinguish among multiple, highly correlated regressors. This impasse can be overcome by shifting the object of inference from single variables to groups of correlated variables. To achieve this, it is necessary to construct "group knockoffs." While successful examples are already documented in the literature, this paper substantially expands the set of algorithms and software for group knockoffs. We focus in particular on second-order knockoffs, for which we describe correlation matrix approximations that are appropriate for GWAS data and that result in considerable computational savings. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with simulations and with the analysis of albuminuria data from the UK Biobank.
  The described algorithms are implemented in an open-source Julia package Knockoffs.jl, for which both R and Python wrappers are available.</description>
