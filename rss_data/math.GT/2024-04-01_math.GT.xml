      <title>Density results for the modular group of infinite-type surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we show two results about approximating, with respect to the compact-open topology, mapping classes on surfaces of infinite-type by quasi-conformal maps, in particular we are interested in density results. The first result is that given any infinite-type surface $S$ there exists a hyperbolic structure $X$ on $S$ such that $\text{PMCG}(S)\subseteq \overline{\text{Mod}(X)}$, for $\text{Mod}(X)$ the set of quasi-conformal homeomorphism on $X$. The second result is that given any surface $S$ with countably many ends then there exists a hyperbolic structure $X$ such that $\text{MCG} (S)=\overline{\text{Mod}(X)}$.</description>

      <title>Algebraically overtwisted tight $3$-manifolds from $+1$ surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We execute Avdek's algorithm to find many algebraically overtwisted and tight $3$-manifolds by contact $+1$ surgeries. In particular, we show that a contact $1/k$ surgery on the standard contact $3$-sphere along any positive torus knot with the maximum Thurston-Bennequin invariant yields an algebraically overtwisted and tight $3$-manifold, where $k$ is a positive integer.</description>

      <title>Separation of plane sets by equidistant simple closed curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if two subsets ${A}$ and ${B}$ of the plane are connected, ${A}$ is bounded, and the Euclidean distance $\rho({A},{B})$ between ${A}$ and ${B}$ is greater than zero, then for every positive $\varepsilon&lt;\rho({A},{B})$, the sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ can be separated by a simple closed curve (also known as a Jordan curve) whose points all lie at distance $\varepsilon$ from the set ${A}$. We also prove that the $\varepsilon$-boundary of a connected bounded subset ${A}$ of the plane contains a simple closed curve bounding the domain containing the open $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of ${A}$. It is shown that in both statements the connectivity condition can be significantly weakened. We also show that the $\varepsilon$-boundary of a nonempty bounded subset of the plane contains a simple closed curve. This result complements Morton Brown's statement that the $\varepsilon$-boundary of a nonempty compact subset of the plane is contained in the union of a finite number of simple closed curves.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal calculations in fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Hopf invariants, defined by evaluation in Harrison cohomology of the commutative cochains of a space, calculate the logarithm map from a fundamental group to its Malcev Lie algebra. They thus present the zeroth Harrison cohomology as a universal dual object to the Malcev Lie algebra. This structural theorem supports explicit calculations in algebraic topology, geometric topology and combinatorial group theory. In particular, we give the first algorithm to determine whether a word raised to some power is a k-fold nested product of commutators, in any group presented by generators and relations.</description>

      <title>Stabilization distance bounds from link Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.09158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set of connected surfaces in the 4-ball with boundary a fixed knot in the 3-sphere. We define the stabilization distance between two surfaces as the minimal $g$ such that we can get from one to the other using stabilizations and destabilizations through surfaces of genus at most $g$. Similarly, we consider a double point distance between two surfaces of the same genus, which is the minimum over all regular homotopies connecting the two surfaces of the maximal number of double points appearing in the homotopy. To many of the concordance invariants defined using Heegaard Floer homology, we construct an analogous invariant for a pair of surfaces. We show that these give lower bounds on the stabilization distance and the double point distance. We compute our invariants for some pairs of deform-spun slice disks by proving a trace formula on the full infinity knot Floer complex, and by determining the action on knot Floer homology of an automorphism of the connected sum of a knot with itself that swaps the two summands. We use our invariants to find pairs of slice disks with arbitrarily large distance with respect to many of the metrics we consider in this paper. We also answer a slice disk analogue of Problem 1.105 (B) from Kirby's problem list by showing the existence of non-0-cobordant slice disks.</description>

      <title>Naturality of Legendrian LOSS invariant under positive contact surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ozsvath and Stipsicz showed that the LOSS invariant is natural under +1 contact surgery. We extend their result and prove the naturality of the LOSS invariant of a Legendrian L under any positive integer contact surgery along another Legendrian S . In addition, when S is rationally null-homologous, we also entirely characterize the Spin^c structure in the surgery cobordism that makes the naturality of contact invariant or LOSS invariant (without conjugation ambiguity). In particular this implies that contact invariant of the +n contact surgery along a rationally null-homologous Legendrian S depends only on the classical invariants of S. The additional generalityprovided by those results allows us to prove that if two Legendrian knots have different LOSS invariants then after adding the same positive twists to each in a suitable sense, the two new Legendrian knots will also have different LOSS invariants. This leads to new infinite families of examples of Legendrian (or transverse) non-simple knots that are distinguished by their LOSS invariants.</description>

      <title>Strong Nielsen equivalence on the punctured disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the 2-disc $\mathbb{D}^2$ that fixes the boundary pointwise and leaves invariant a finite subset in the interior of $\mathbb{D}^2$. We study the strong Nielsen equivalence of periodic points of such homeomorphisms $f$ and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for two periodic points to be strong Nielsen equivalent in the context of braid theory. In addition, we present an application of our result to the trace formula given by Jiang--Zheng, deducing that the obtained forced periodic orbits belong to different strong Nielsen classes.</description>
