      <title>Joint Liability Model with Adaptation to Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the application of ESG score assessment methodologies from large corporations to individual farmers' production, within the context of climate change. Our proposal involves the integration of crucial agricultural sustainability variables into conventional personal credit evaluation frameworks, culminating in the formulation of a holistic sustainable credit rating referred to as the Environmental, Social, Economics (ESE) score. This ESE score is integrated into theoretical joint liability models, to gain valuable insights into optimal group sizes and individual-ESE score relationships. Additionally, we adopt a mean-variance utility function for farmers to effectively capture the risk associated with anticipated profits. Through a set of simulation exercises, the paper investigates the implications of incorporating ESE scores into credit evaluation systems, offering a nuanced comprehension of the repercussions under various climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>Does Peer-Reviewed Research Help Predict Stock Returns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mining 29,000 accounting ratios for t-statistics over 2.0 leads to cross-sectional predictability similar to the peer review process. For both methods, about 50% of predictability remains after the original sample periods. Data mining generates other features of peer review including the rise in returns as original sample periods end, the speed of post-sample decay, and themes like investment, issuance, and accruals. Predictors supported by peer-reviewed risk explanations underperform data mining. Similarly, the relationship between modeling rigor and post-sample returns is negative. Our results suggest peer review systematically mislabels mispricing as risk, though only 18% of predictors are attributed to risk.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibria in Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to the global climate crisis, governments worldwide are introducing legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to help mitigate environmental catastrophes. One method to encourage emission reductions is to incentivize carbon capturing and carbon reducing projects while simultaneously penalising excess GHG output. Firms that invest in such projects or reduce their emissions can receive offset credits (OCs) in return. They may then use OCs for regulatory purposes to offset emissions in a compliance period or trade them. Here, we present a novel market framework and characterise the optimal behaviour of GHG OC market participants in both single-player and two-player settings. The single player setting is posed as an optimal stopping and control problem, while the two-player setting is posed as optimal stopping and mixed-Nash equilibria problem. We demonstrate the importance of acting optimally using numerical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations and explore the differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous players.</description>
