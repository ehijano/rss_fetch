      <title>Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign at 11.5 GeV apparently results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>

      <title>Chiral-scale effective field theory for dense and thermal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We established a new power counting scheme, chiral-scale density counting (CSDC) rules, for the application of the chiral-scale effective field theory to nuclear matter at finite densities and temperatures. Within this framework, the free fermion gas is at the leading order, while one-boson-exchange interactions appear at the next-to-leading order, and the multi-meson couplings are at higher orders. Then, we applied the CSDC rules to study the nuclear matter properties, and estimated the valid regions of the CSDC rules. It was found that the zero temperature symmetric nuclear matter properties around saturation density and the critical temperature of liquid-gas phase transition can be captured by an appropriate choice of CSDC orders, and the results beyond these regions are align with the chiral nuclear force. Moreover, the evolution of scale symmetry was found to be consistent with previous studies. The results of this work indicate that the quantum corrections may be crucial in the studies of nuclear matter in a wide density region.</description>

      <title>The size of the quark-gluon plasma in ultracentral collisions: impact of initial density fluctuations on the average transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T\rangle$ of outgoing particles increases as a function of the particle multiplicity in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions at collider energies. This increase was originally predicted on the basis of simulations where the multiplicity increase occurred at constant volume, so that it implied a larger density and temperature. However, recent state-of-the-art simulations have shown that, for some models of initial condition, the volume may vary with the multiplicity in ultracentral collisions. We elucidate this effect by analytically relating the variation of the volume to the radial distribution of the one- and two-point functions of the fluctuating density field. We show that the volume variation is small if the total entropy of the ultracentral collisions scales with the mass number of the colliding isotopes. We argue that probing detailed transverse distributions of initial-state fluctuations through the ultracentral $\langle p_T\rangle$ has nontrivial implications for models of nuclear structure and of the pre-equilibrium stages.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic and Exotic Moments in Nuclear DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic interactions are important probes for studying and testing our understanding of the atomic nucleus, as they reflect emergent properties across the nuclear chart. We examine their corresponding observables, which relate to charge and current distributions in nuclei expressed through their multipole components. We focus on theoretical results obtained within nuclear density functional theory (DFT) to derive self-consistent, symmetry-restored nuclear wave functions along with their spectroscopic multipole moments. We show how these compare with experimental data. We also discuss possible improvements in the formulation of magnetic dipole operators by including two-body meson-exchange contributions. Discussions of exotic symmetry-breaking moments emphasise their importance for understanding fine details of fundamental nuclear interactions. Detailed derivations are delegated to the accompanying Supplemental Material.</description>

      <title>Light new physics and the $\tau$ lepton dipole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing New-Physics (NP) scenarios that couple predominantly to the third generation is notoriously difficult experimentally, as exemplified by comparing limits for the $\tau$ lepton dipole moments to those of electron and muon. In this case, extracting limits from processes such as $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ often relies on effective-field-theory (EFT) arguments, which allows for model-independent statements, but only applies if the NP scale is sufficiently large compared to the center-of-mass energy. In this work we offer a comprehensive analysis of light NP contributions to the $\tau$ dipole moments, providing a detailed account of the interpretation of asymmetry measurements in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ that are tailored towards the extraction of dipole moments, for the test cases of new light spin-$0$ and spin-$1$ bosons. Moreover, we study the decoupling to the EFT limit in these scenarios and discuss the complementarity to constraints from other related processes, such as production in $e^+e^-$ reactions. While covering a wide range of light NP scenarios, as specific case study we present a detailed discussion of a tauphilic gauge vector boson at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the initial state of hydrodynamics in pp and pA collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of seeming hydrodynamic-like behavior in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions presents us with the conceptual problem of how the initial state of such a hydrodynamic evolution should be characterized. This is an issue because, while nuclei can reasonably be approximated as ``large'' systems w.r.t. the characteristic Fermi momentum of their constituents, this is no longer true for nucleons. Hence, one would need to match a ``quantum'' theory, whose observables are described via highly non-commuting operators, to a ``classical'' hydrodynamics. Operationally assuming a ``fast'' thermalization, we survey what kind of object is best suited to such a matching condition. We show that it cannot be any of the objects usually associated with ``the 3D structure of the nucleon'' but rather a measure associated with entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large invariant mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large invariant mass, $\gamma N \rightarrow N' M_1M_2$, in the framework of collinear factorisation. The mesons considered $M_1$ and $M_2$ are either pions or rho mesons, charged or neutral. We consider the kinematic regime characterised by a large invariant mass of the two-meson system, and a small deflection of the nucleon in the centre-of-mass frame. In this kinematic domain, the amplitude factorises into a perturbative hard part and non-perturbative parts described by Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Distribution Amplitudes (DAs). We automate the calculation of the fully differential cross section at leading twist and leading order, and we present some numerical results at JLab 12 GeV kinematics. This class of processes provides yet more exclusive $2 \to 3$ channels that can be used to extract GPDs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of kaonium as a sharp resonance in photon-photon to meson-meson cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the binding energies of the hypothetical mesonic atom, $K^+ K^-$ (kaonium), using the $K^+ K^- \to K^+ K^-$ elastic scattering amplitude. Our findings are in line with previously reported results, which involve solving an eigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev-Popov type. Using chiral perturbation theory, we show that kaonium manifests itself as a sharp resonance around 992 MeV accompanying $f_0 (980)$ or $a_0 (980)$ in cross-sections for processes $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ or $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta$. The latter process is particularly striking: the peak at the kaonium resonance energy is highly pronounced, with the ratio of the cross-sections $\sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta) / \sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0) \approx 9$. Due to the short lifetime of kaonium ($\sim 10^{-18}$ s) and its small decay width ($\sim 0.4$ keV), direct detection of this exotic atom poses a significant challenge and requires high experimental resolution. However, we show that once the formation of kaonium is considered in the cross-section, a better fit to the available experimental data is obtained.</description>

      <title>Impact of spin polarization on transport and thermodynamic coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of parton spin polarization on effective transport and thermodynamic coefficients in noncentral light- and heavy-ion collisions. To model this influence, we consider two sources of spin polarization: thermal vorticity, induced by angular momentum, and thermal shear, arising from local velocity gradients. Using a novel kinetic theory framework, we find that transport and thermodynamic coefficients--including the speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2}$, specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$, specific bulk viscosity $\zeta/s$, and mean free path $\lambda$--are substantially modified by spin polarization effects. Among the two sources, thermal vorticity-induced spin polarization dominates the modifications to these coefficients. Moreover, both $c_{s}^{2}$ and $\zeta/s$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the collision energy, and the associated scaling behaviors potentially serve as indicators of the critical phenomena of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic phases potentially play a role in the internal composition of neutron stars, the main laboratory for the phase structure of QCD at high baryon densities. We review the study of such a phase, the chiral density wave, within a phenomenological nucleon-meson model, including nucleonic vacuum fluctuations within a renormalization scheme recently developed. Neutron stars in this model and within our approximations either do not contain a chiral density wave core or they are too light to agree with observations.</description>

      <title>Equation of state for hyperonic neutron-star matter in SU(3) flavor symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to finite-nucleus observables and bulk properties of dense nuclear matter, we investigate hyperonic neutron-star matter within an SU(3) flavor-symmetry scheme. To retain SU(6)-based couplings within SU(3) flavor symmetry, we add a quartic $\phi$ self-interaction and $\phi$-$\rho$ mixing. We demonstrate the roles of $\alpha_{v}$ ($F/(F+D)$ ratio), $\theta_{v}$ (mixing angle), and $z_{v}$ (singlet-to-octet coupling ratio) in SU(3)-invariant vector-meson couplings. It is found that $z_{v}$ predominantly controls the maximum mass of a neutron star, and $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars can be supported for $z_{v}\le0.15$. The $\alpha_{v}$ also helps sustain large masses, whereas $\theta_{v}$ has a smaller effect on neutron-star properties. This SU(3) framework reconciles nuclear and astrophysical constraints, and offers a plausible resolution to the hyperon puzzle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Indirect method for nuclear reactions and the role of the self energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a nuclear species (e.g., a nucleon or a deuteron nucleus) propagating freely is made to collide with a target nucleus, its trajectory is modified by exchanging variable amounts of energy, mass, linear and angular momentum with the target, according to its interaction with the nuclear medium. By addressing this perturbation away from the free path, one hopes to learn something about the nature of the medium through which our probe propagates. This is the essence of the experimental use of nuclear reactions for the purpose of gathering information about nuclear structure. In order to deal with the structure and the reaction aspects of a specific experiment on the same footing, it is therefore desirable to identify a theoretical construct that embodies the modification of the propagation of a particle in the medium with respect to the free case, and use it both for the determination of the nuclear spectrum (structure) and for the calculation of scattering observables (reaction). A candidate for such an object is the self energy, and we will try in the present lectures to put it at the center stage in the formulation of scattering theory.</description>

Abstract: The double pole singularity of the $S$-matrix, the so-called exceptional point, associated with the $5/2^-$ doublet of resonances in the spectrum of $^{7}$Be has been identified in the framework of the Gamow shell model. The exceptional point singularity is demonstrated by the coalescence of wave functions and spectral functions of the two resonances, as well as by the singular behavior of spectroscopic factors and electromagnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>BIGSTICK: A flexible configuration-interaction shell-model code (updated)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present BIGSTICK, a flexible configuration-interaction open-source shell-model code for the many-fermion problem. Written mostly in Fortran 90 with some later extensions, BIGSTICK utilizes a factorized on-the-fly algorithm for computing many-body matrix elements, and has both MPI (distributed memory) and OpenMP (shared memory) parallelization, and can run on platforms ranging from laptops to the largest parallel supercomputers. It uses a flexible yet efficient many-body truncation scheme, and reads input files in multiple formats, allowing one to tackle both phenomenological (major valence shell space) and ab initio (the so-called no-core shell model) calculations. BIGSTICK can generate energy spectra, static and transition one-body densities, and expectation values of scalar operators. Using the built-in Lanczos algorithm one can compute transition probability distributions and decompose wave functions into components defined by group theory.
  This manual provides a general guide to compiling and running BIGSTICK, which comes with numerous sample input files, as well as some of the basic theory underlying the code. Updated November 2025 to version 8.0.0</description>

Abstract: This study derives the relativistic transformations of thermodynamic quantities from the Lorentz transformations applied to the four-momentum components of a thermodynamic system, which is stationary in the inertial reference frame $K_0$ and moves at constant velocity relative to the laboratory frame $K$. Thermodynamic variables are introduced into the formalism via the zeroth component of the four-momentum in $K_0$, representing the system's internal energy. By treating the three-momentum as an independent state variable, thermodynamic quantities are defined by differentiating the zeroth component of the four-momentum (the Hamiltonian) in the reference frame $K$ with respect to the independent state variables, yielding the fundamental thermodynamic potential. This approach results in the Non-Planck transformations, which differ from the Planck transformations by a factor of $\alpha$. In contrast, by adopting the three-velocity as an independent state variable, thermodynamic quantities are obtained by differentiating the negative Lagrangian, derived from the zeroth component of the four-momentum via Legendre transformations, with respect to the independent state variables, producing the conjugate fundamental thermodynamic potential. This yields the Planck transformations. Conversely, the Ott transformations are derived from the zeroth component of the four-momentum by treating velocity as an independent state variable. This approach conflicts with the principles of mechanics, resulting in an energy that does not qualify as a thermodynamic potential. To validate these findings, we analyze an ultrarelativistic ideal gas of quarks and gluons within the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Furthermore, we develop consistent Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis blast-wave models for finite-volume freeze-out firecylinders in heavy ion collisions, incorporating Planck and Ott transformations.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11234</link>

Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Parquet theory for molecular systems: Formalism and static kernel parquet approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.</description>
