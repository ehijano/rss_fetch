      <title>Identification and Estimation of Joint Potential Outcome Distributions from a Single Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most causal inference methods focus on estimating marginal average treatment effects, but many important causal estimands depend on the joint distribution of potential outcomes, including the probability of causation and proportions benefiting from or harmed by treatment. Wu et al (2025) recently established nonparametric identification of this joint distribution for categorical outcomes under binary treatment by leveraging variation across multiple studies. We demonstrate that their multi-study framework can be implemented within a single study by using a baseline covariate that is associated with untreated potential outcomes but does not modify treatment effects conditional on those outcomes. This reframing substantially broadens the practical applicability of their results, as it eliminates the need for multiple independent datasets and gives analysts control over covariate selection to satisfy key identifying assumptions. We provide complete identification and estimation theory for the single-study setting, including a Neyman-orthogonal estimator for cases where the conditional independence assumption only holds after adjusting for covariates. We validate the estimator in a simulation and apply it to data from a large field experiment assessing the effect of mailings on voter turnout.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Moderated Causal Excursion Odds Ratio in Micro-Randomized Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) have become increasingly popular for developing and evaluating mobile health interventions that promote healthy behaviors and manage chronic conditions. The recently proposed causal excursion effects have become the standard measure for interventions' marginal and moderated effect in MRTs. Existing methods for MRTs with binary outcomes focus on causal excursion effects on the relative risk scale. However, a causal excursion effect on the odds ratio scale is attractive for its interpretability and valid predicted probabilities, making it a valuable supplement to causal excursion relative risk. In this paper, we propose two novel estimators for the moderated causal excursion odds ratio for MRTs with longitudinal binary outcomes. When the prespecified moderator fully captures the way interventions are sequentially randomized, we propose a doubly robust estimator that remains consistent if either of two nuisance models is correctly specified. For more general settings in which treatment randomization depends on variables beyond the chosen moderator, we propose a general estimator that incorporates an association nuisance model. We further establish the general estimator's robustness to the misspecification of the association nuisance model under no causal effect, and extend the general estimator to accommodate any link functions. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of both estimators and demonstrate their performance through simulation studies. We apply the methods to Drink Less, a 30-day MRT for developing mobile health interventions to help reduce alcohol consumption, where the proximal outcome is whether the user opens the app in the hour following the notification.</description>

      <title>Incorporating External Controls for Estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated with High-Dimensional Data: Retaining Double Robustness and Ensuring Double Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for causal inference in biomedical research. For instance, when estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), a doubly robust estimation procedure can be applied, requiring either the propensity score model or the control outcome model to be correctly specified. In this paper, we address scenarios where external control data, often with a much larger sample size, are available. Such data are typically easier to obtain from historical records or third-party sources. However, we find that incorporating external controls into the standard doubly robust estimator for ATT may paradoxically result in reduced efficiency compared to using the estimator without external controls. This counterintuitive outcome suggests that the naive incorporation of external controls could be detrimental to estimation efficiency. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel doubly robust estimator that guarantees higher efficiency than the standard approach without external controls, even under model misspecification. When all models are correctly specified, this estimator aligns with the standard doubly robust estimator that incorporates external controls and achieves semiparametric efficiency. The asymptotic theory developed in this work applies to high-dimensional confounder settings, which are increasingly common with the growing prevalence of electronic health record data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through extensive simulation studies and a real-world data application.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Single-Index Mixed-Effects Model for Non-Gaussian National Survey Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an innovative statistical model to quantify periodontal disease in the context of complex medical data. A mixed-effects model incorporating skewed random effects and heavy-tailed residuals is introduced, ensuring robust handling of non-normal data distributions. The fixed effect is modeled as a combination of a slope parameter and a single index function, constrained to be monotonic increasing for meaningful interpretation. This approach captures different dimensions of periodontal disease progression by integrating Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) and Pocket Depth (PD) biomarkers within a unified analytical framework. A variable selection method based on the grouped horseshoe prior is employed, addressing the relatively high number of risk factors. Furthermore, survey weight information typically provided with large survey data is incorporated to ensure accurate inference. This comprehensive methodology significantly advances the statistical quantification of periodontal disease, offering a nuanced and precise assessment of risk factors and disease progression. The proposed methodology is implemented in the \textsf{R} package \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=MSIMST}{\textsc{MSIMST}}.</description>

      <title>Online Sequential Leveraging Sampling Method for Streaming Autoregressive Time Series with Application to Seismic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data contain complex temporal information that arrives at high speed and has a large, even potentially unbounded volume. The explosion of temporally correlated streaming data from advanced seismic sensors poses analytical challenges due to its sheer volume and real-time nature. Sampling, or data reduction, is a natural yet powerful tool for handling large streaming data while balancing estimation accuracy and computational cost. Currently, data reduction methods and their statistical properties for streaming data, especially streaming autoregressive time series, are not well-studied in the literature. In this article, we propose an online leverage-based sequential data reduction algorithm for streaming autoregressive time series with application to seismic data. The proposed Sequential Leveraging Sampling (SLS) method selects only one consecutively recorded block from the data stream for inference. While the starting point of the SLS block is chosen using a random mechanism based on streaming leverage scores of data, the block size is determined by a sequential stopping rule. The SLS block offers efficient sample usage, as evidenced by our results confirming asymptotic normality for the normalized least squares estimator in both linear and nonlinear autoregressive settings. The SLS method is applied to two seismic datasets: the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake doublet data on the macroseismic scale and the Oklahoma seismic data on the microseismic scale. We demonstrate the ability of the SLS method to efficiently identify seismic events and elucidate their intricate temporal dependence structure. Simulation studies are presented to evaluate the empirical performance of the SLS method.</description>

      <title>Modi linear failure rate distribution with application to survival time data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new lifetime model, named the Modi linear failure rate distribution, is suggested. This flexible model is capable of accommodating a wide range of hazard rate shapes, including decreasing, increasing, bathtub, upside-down bathtub, and modified bathtub forms, making it particularly suitable for modeling diverse survival and reliability data. Our proposed model contains the Modi exponential distribution and the Modi Rayleigh distribution as sub-models. Numerous mathematical and reliability properties are derived, including the $r^{th}$ moment, moment generating function, $r^{th}$ conditional moment, quantile function, order statistics, mean deviations, R\'{e}nyi entropy, and reliability function. The method of maximum likelihood is employed to estimate the model parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to examine how these estimators perform. The superior fit of our newly introduced model is proved through two real-world survival data sets.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Parameter Estimation of Partially Observed Diffusions using Diffusion Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the estimation of static parameters for partially observed diffusion processes with discrete-time observations over a fixed time interval. In particular, when one only has access to time-discretized solutions of the diffusions we build upon the works of \cite{ub_par,ub_grad} to devise a method that can estimate the parameters without time-discretization bias. We leverage an identity associated to the gradient of the log-likelihood associated to diffusion bridges, which has not been used before. Contrary to the afore mentioned methods, the diffusion coefficient can depend on the parameters and our approach facilitates the use of more efficient Markov chain sampling algorithms. We prove that our estimator is unbiased with finite variance and demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology in several examples.</description>

      <title>A Latent Variable Framework for Multiple Imputation with Non-ignorable Missingness: Analyzing Perceptions of Social Justice in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general multiple imputation approach for analyzing large-scale data with missing values. An imputation model is derived from a joint distribution induced by a latent variable model, which can flexibly capture associations among variables of mixed types. The model also allows for missingness which depends on the latent variables and is thus non-ignorable with respect to the observed data. We develop a frequentist multiple imputation method for this framework and provide asymptotic theory that establishes valid inference for a broad class of analysis models. Simulation studies confirm the method's theoretical properties and robust practical performance. The procedure is applied to a cross-national analysis of individuals' perceptions of justice and fairness of income distributions in their societies, using data from the European Social Survey which has substantial nonresponse. The analysis demonstrates that failing to account for non-ignorable missingness can yield biased conclusions; for instance, complete-case analysis is shown to exaggerate the correlation between personal income and perceived fairness of income distributions in society. Code implementing the proposed methodology is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/non-ignorable-missing-data-imputation-E885.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference for velocity-jump models for movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity-jump model is a specific type of piecewise deterministic Markov process in which an individual's velocity is constant except at times that form the events of some point process. It represents an interpretable continuous-time version of the discrete-time `step and turn' models widely used in analysing wildlife telemetry. In this paper, I derive a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to carry out exact Bayesian inference for velocity-jump models by reconstructing the trajectories between observations, and illustrate its use in analysing real and simulated telemetry data. The method uses a proposal distribution for updating velocities that is constructed by approximating the movement model with a multivariate normal distribution and then conditioning that distribution on the data. The velocity-jump models considered can incorporate measurement error and Markov dependence between successive velocities.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with an Unobservable Source Subpopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.</description>

      <title>Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks, multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction and feedback.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Variational Graph Fused Lasso for Recovering Relative Rates in Spatial Compositional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS, and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.</description>

      <title>Overidentification testing with weak instruments and heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exogeneity is key for IV estimators, which can assessed via overidentification (OID) tests. We discuss the Kleibergen-Paap (KP) rank test as a heteroskedasticity-robust OID test and compare to the typical J-test. We derive the heteroskedastic weak-instrument limiting distributions for J and KP as special cases of the robust score test estimated via 2SLS and LIML respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that KP usually performs better than J, which is prone to severe size distortions. Test size depends on model parameters not consistently estimable with weak instruments, so a conservative approach is recommended. This generalises recommendations to use LIML-based OID tests under homoskedasticity. We then revisit the classic problem of estimating the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) in lifecycle consumption models. Lagged macroeconomic indicators should provide naturally valid but frequently weak instruments. The literature provides a wide range of estimates for this parameter, and J frequently rejects the null of valid instruments. J often rejects the null whereas KP does not; we suggest that J over-rejects, sometimes severely. We argue that KP-test should be used over the J-test. We also argue that instrument invalidity/misspecification is unlikely the cause of the range of EIS estimates in the literature.</description>

      <title>WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text. Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a modern and pertinent problem.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Cocycles: A Framework for Robust and Coherent Counterfactual Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating joint distributions (a.k.a. couplings) over counterfactual outcomes is central to personalized decision-making and treatment risk assessment. Two emergent frameworks with identifiability guarantees are: (i) bijective structural causal models (SCMs), which are flexible but brittle to mis-specified latent noise; and (ii) optimal-transport (OT) methods, which avoid latent noise assumptions but can produce incoherent counterfactual transports which fail to identify higher-order couplings. In this work, we bridge the gap with \emph{counterfactual cocycles}: a framework for counterfactual transports that use algebraic structure to provide coherence and identifiability guarantees. Every counterfactual cocycle corresponds to an equivalence class of SCMs, however the cocycle is invariant to the latent noise distribution, enabling us to sidestep various mis-specification problems. We characterize the structure of all identifiable counterfactual cocycles; propose flexible model parameterizations; introduce a novel cocycle estimator that avoids any distributional assumptions; and derive mis-specification robustness properties of the resulting counterfactual inference method. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and noise-robustness of counterfactual cocycles across synthetic benchmarks and a 401(k) eligibility study.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Multi-scale Leverage Effect Estimator under Dependent Microstructure Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the leverage effect from high-frequency data is vital but challenged by complex, dependent microstructure noise, often exhibiting non-Gaussian higher-order moments. This paper introduces a novel multi-scale framework for efficient and robust leverage effect estimation under such flexible noise structures. We develop two new estimators, the Subsampling-and-Averaging Leverage Effect (SALE) and the Multi-Scale Leverage Effect (MSLE), which adapt subsampling and multi-scale approaches holistically using a unique shifted window technique. This design simplifies the multi-scale estimation procedure and enhances noise robustness without requiring the pre-averaging approach. We establish central limit theorems and stable convergence, with MSLE achieving convergence rates of an optimal $n^{-1/4}$ and a near-optimal $n^{-1/9}$ for the noise-free and noisy settings, respectively. A cornerstone of our framework's efficiency is a specifically designed MSLE weighting strategy that leverages covariance structures across scales. This significantly reduces asymptotic variance and, critically, yields substantially smaller finite-sample errors than existing methods under both noise-free and realistic noisy settings. Extensive simulations and empirical analyses confirm the superior efficiency, robustness, and practical advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Treatment with Noncompliance: Identifying the Cumulative Average Treatment Effect via Multisite Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When evaluating a two-phase intervention, the cumulative average treatment effect (ATE) is often the primary causal estimand of interest. However, some individuals who do not respond well to the Phase I treatment may subsequently display noncompliant behaviours. At the same time, exposure to the Phase I treatment is expected to directly influence an individual's potential outcomes, thereby violating the exclusion restriction. Building on an instrumental variable (IV) strategy for multisite trials, we clarify the conditions under which the cumulative ATE of a two-phase treatment can be identified by employing the random assignment of the Phase I treatment as the instrument. Our strategy relaxes both the conventional exclusion restriction and sequential ignorability assumptions. We assess the performance of the new strategy through simulation studies. Additionally, we reanalyze data from the Tennessee class size study, in which students and teachers were randomly assigned to either small or regular class types in kindergarten (Phase I) with noncompliance emerging in Grade 1 (Phase II). Applying our new strategy, we estimate the cumulative ATE of receiving two consecutive years of instruction in a small versus regular class.</description>

      <title>Clustering methods for Categorical Time Series and Sequences : A scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To provide an overview of clustering methods for categorical time series (CTS), a data structure commonly found in epidemiology, sociology, biology, and marketing, and to support method selection in regards to data characteristics.
  Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from inception up to November 2024 to identify articles that propose and evaluate clustering techniques for CTS. Methods were classified according to three major families -- distance-based, feature-based, and model-based -- and assessed on their ability to handle data challenges such as variable sequence length, multivariate data, continuous time, missing data, time-invariant covariates, and large data volumes.
  Results: Out of 14607 studies, we included 124 articles describing 129 methods, spanning domains such as artificial intelligence, social sciences, and epidemiology. Distance-based methods, particularly those using Optimal Matching, were most prevalent, with 56 methods. We identified 28 model-based methods, which demonstrated superior flexibility for handling complex data structures such as multivariate data, continuous time and time-invariant covariates. We also recorded 45 feature-based approaches, which were on average more scalable but less flexible. A searchable Web application was developed to facilitate method selection based on dataset characteristics ( https://cts-clustering-scoping-review-7sxqj3sameqvmwkvnzfynz.streamlit.app/ )
  Discussion: While distance-based methods dominate, model-based approaches offer the richest modeling potential but are less scalable. Feature-based methods favor performance over flexibility, with limited support for complex data structures.
  Conclusion: This review highlights methodological diversity and gaps in CTS clustering. The proposed typology aims to guide researchers in selecting methods for their specific use cases.</description>

      <title>Improving Disease Risk Estimation in Small Areas by Accounting for Spatiotemporal Local Discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a two-step method to enhance disease risk estimation in small areas by integrating spatiotemporal cluster detection within a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model. First, we introduce an efficient scan-statistic-based clustering algorithm that employs a greedy search within the scan window, enabling flexible cluster detection across large spatial domains. We then integrate these detected clusters into a Bayesian spatiotemporal model to estimate relative risks, explicitly accounting for identified risk discontinuities. We apply this methodology to large-scale cancer mortality data at the municipality level across continental Spain. Our results show our method offers superior cluster detection accuracy compared to SaTScan. Furthermore, integrating cluster information into a Bayesian spatiotemporal model significantly improves model fit and risk estimate performance, as evidenced by better DIC, WAIC, and logarithmic scores than SaTScan-based or standard BYM2 models. This methodology provides a powerful tool for epidemiological analysis, offering a more precise identification of high- and low-risk areas and enhancing the accuracy of risk estimation models.</description>

      <title>Towards Complete Causal Explanation with Expert Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of restricting a Markov equivalence class of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) to only those MAGs that contain certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert or orientation knowledge. Such a restriction of the Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential ancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation rules for adding orientation knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with orientation knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm for including this orientation knowledge and show that in certain settings the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally, outside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent confounding.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Reasoning On Parametric Knowledge for Inferring Causal Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery catalyzes human intellectual advances, driven by the cycle of hypothesis generation, experimental design, evaluation, and assumption refinement. Central to this process is causal inference, uncovering the mechanisms behind observed phenomena. While randomized experiments provide strong inferences, they are often infeasible due to ethical or practical constraints. However, observational studies are prone to confounding or mediating biases. While crucial, identifying such backdoor paths is expensive and heavily depends on scientists' domain knowledge to generate hypotheses. We introduce a novel benchmark where the objective is to complete a partial causal graph. We design a benchmark with varying difficulty levels with over 4000 queries. We show the strong ability of LLMs to hypothesize the backdoor variables between a cause and its effect. Unlike simple knowledge memorization of fixed associations, our task requires the LLM to reason according to the context of the entire graph.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</description>

      <title>Testing Hypotheses regarding Covariance and Correlation matrices with the R package CovCorTest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In addition to the commonly analyzed measures of location, dispersion measurements such as variance and correlation provide many valuable information. Consequently, they play a crucial role in multivariate statistics, which leads to tests regarding covariance and correlation matrices. Furthermore, also the structure of these matrices leads to important hypotheses of interest, since it contains substantial information about the underlying model. In fact, assumptions regarding the structures of covariance and correlation matrices are often fundamental in statistical modelling and testing.
  In this context, semi-parametric settings with minimal distributional assumptions and very general hypotheses are essential for enabling manifold usage. The free available package CovCorTest provides suitable tests addressing all aforementioned issues, using bootstrap and similar techniques to achieve good performance, particularly in small samples. Additionally, the package offers flexible specification options for the hypotheses under investigation in two central tests, accommodating users with varying levels of expertise, which results in high flexibility and user-friendliness at the same time. This paper also presents the application of \textbf{CovCorTest} for various issues, illustrated by multiple examples, where the tests are applied to a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Few-Shot Neural Emulator for Computer-Model System Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long-horizon rollout of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories. Finally, with only 10 solver steps' worth of augmented stencil data, our approach outperforms traditional ML emulators trained on thousands of trajectories in long-horizon rollout accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Distribution Compression: Reducing Both Data Size and Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.</description>
