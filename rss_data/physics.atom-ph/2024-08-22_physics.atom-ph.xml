      <title>Systematic study of confinement induced effects on atomic electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that although a litany of studies have been published on atoms in hard-wall confinement, they have either not been systematic, having only looked at select atoms and/or select electronic configurations, or they have not used robust numerical methods. To remedy the situation, we perform in this work a methodical study of atoms in hard-wall confinement with the HelFEM program, which employs the finite element method (FEM) that trivially implements the hard-wall potential, guarantees variational results, and allows easily finding the numerically exact solution.
  We systematically examine low lying configurations of the H-Xe atoms and their monocations, and investigate how the states - especially the ground state - behave as a function of the position of the hard-wall boundary. Our fully numerical calculations are based on non-relativistic density functional theory (DFT), employing the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional and spherically averaged densities. We consider calculations with both spin-polarized as well as spin-restricted densities, and demonstrate that spin-polarization effects are significant in open shell configurations, even though some previous studies have only considered the spin-restricted model.
  We demonstrate the importance of considering ground state changes for confined atoms by computing the ionization radii for the H-Xe atoms and observe significant differences to earlier studies. Confirming previous observations, we identify electron shifts on the outermost shells for a majority of the elements: valence $s$ electrons are highly unfavored under strong confinement, and the high-lying $3d$ and $4f$ orbitals become occupied in atoms of periods 2-3 and 4, respectively.</description>

      <title>Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency of $^{85}$Rb vapor in Ar, Ne and N$_2$ gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental study on Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in rubidium (Rb) vapor cells containing inert gases at pressures $\le 5$ Torr is reported. Using an inert-gas-free Rb vapor cell as a reference, we measure frequency shift and line broadening of the EIT spectra in Rb vapor cells with argon, neon or nitrogen gases at pressures ranging from a few mTorr to 5 Torr. The results qualitatively agree with a pseudo-potential model that includes $s$-wave scattering between the Rydberg electron and the inert-gas atoms, and the effect of polarization of the inert-gas atoms by the Rydberg atoms. Our results are important for establishing Rydberg-EIT as an all-optical and non-intrusive spectroscopic probe for field diagnostics in low-pressure radio-frequency discharges.</description>

      <title>Fine-structure changing collisions in $^{87}$Rb upon D2 excitation in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fine structure changing collisions in $^{87}$Rb vapour upon D2 excitation in a thermal vapour at 350 K; the atoms are placed in a 0.6 T axial magnetic field in order to gain access to the hyperfine Pashen-Back regime. Following optical excitation on the D2 line, the exothermic transfer 5P$_{3/2}$$\rightarrow$5P$_{1/2}$ occurs as a consequence of buffer-gas collisions; the $^{87}$Rb subsequently emits a photon on the D1 transition. We employ single-photon counting apparatus to monitor the D1 fluorescence, with an etalon filter to provide high spectral resolution. By studying the D1 fluorescence when the D2 excitation laser is scanned, we see that during the collisional transfer process the $m_{J}$ quantum number of the atom changes, but the nuclear spin projection quantum number, $m_{I}$, is conserved. A simple kinematic model incorporating a coefficient of restitution in the collision accounted for the change in velocity distribution of atoms undergoing collisions, and the resulting fluorescence lineshape. The experiment is conducted with a nominally ``buffer-gas free" vapour cell; our results show that fine structure changing collisions are important with such media, and point out possible implications for quantum-optics experiments in thermal vapours producing entangled photon pairs with the double ladder configuration, and solar physics magneto-optical filters.</description>

      <title>A dissipation-induced superradiant transition in a strontium cavity-QED system</title>

Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), emitters and a resonator are coupled together to enable precise studies of quantum light-matter interactions. Over the past few decades, this has led to a variety of quantum technologies such as more precise inertial sensors, clocks, memories, controllable qubits, and quantum simulators. Furthermore, the intrinsically dissipative nature of cavity QED platforms makes them a natural testbed for exploring driven-dissipative phenomena in open quantum systems as well as equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions in quantum optics. One such model, the so-called cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, concerns the behavior of coherently driven emitters in the presence of collective dissipation (superradiance). Despite tremendous interest, this model has yet to be realized in a clean experimental system. Here we provide an observation of the continuous superradiant phase transition predicted in the CRF model using an ensemble of ultracold $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse optical cavity on a long-lived optical transition. Below a critical drive, atoms quickly reach a steady state determined by the self-balancing of the drive and the collective dissipation. The steady state possesses a macroscopic dipole moment and corresponds to a superradiant phase. Above a critical drive strength, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations until other decoherence processes kick in. In fact, our platform also allows us to witness the change of this phase transition from second to first order induced by single-particle spontaneous emission, which pushes the system towards a different steady state. Our observations are a first step towards finer control of driven-dissipative systems, which have been predicted to generate quantum states that can be harnessed for quantum information processing and in particular quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Beyond skyrmion spin texture from quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology profoundly influences diverse fields of science, providing a powerful framework for classifying phases of matter and predicting nontrivial excitations, such as solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. These topological defects are typically characterized by integer numbers, called topological charges, representing the winding number in their order parameter field. The classification and prediction of topological defects, however, become challenging when singularities are included within the integration domain for calculating the topological charge. While such exotic nonlinear excitations have been proposed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase and spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic gases, experimental observation of these structures and studies of their stability have long been elusive. Here we report the observation of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. The exotic skyrmions are sustained by undergoing anomalous symmetry breaking associated with the eccentric spin singularity and carry half of the elementary charge, distinctive from conventional skyrmions or merons. By successfully realizing the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we identified the eccentric fractional skyrmions, produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and a spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable and can be observed after 2~s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding on complex nonlinear dynamics of nontrivial texture beyond skyrmion in topological quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Direct electrical access to the spin manifolds of individual monovalent lanthanide atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanide atoms show long magnetic lifetimes because of their strongly localized 4f electrons, but electrical control of their spins has been difficult because of their closed valence shell configurations. We achieved electron spin resonance of individual lanthanide atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope to probe the atoms bound to a protective insulating film. These atoms were prepared in the monovalent state with an unpaired 6s electron, enabling tunnel current to access their 4f electrons. Europium spectra display a rich array of transitions among the 54 combined electron and nuclear spin states. In contrast, samarium's ground state is a Kramers doublet with an extraordinarily large g-factor of nearly 5. These results demonstrate that all-electronic sensing and control of individual lanthanide spins is possible for quantum devices and spin-based electronics by using their rarely-observed monovalent cation state.</description>

      <title>Role of momentum in the generator-coordinate method applied to barrier penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Using slow light to enable laser frequency stabilization to a short, high-Q cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art laser frequency stabilization is limited by miniscule length changes caused by thermal noise. In this work, a cavity-length-insensitive frequency stabilization scheme is implemented using strong dispersion in a $21\,\mathrm{mm}$ long cavity with a europium-ion-doped spacer of yttrium orthosilicate. A number of limiting factors for slow light laser stabilization are evaluated, including the inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidth of the ions, the deterioration of spectral windows, and the linewidth of the cavity modes. Using strong dispersion, the cavity modes were narrowed by a factor $1.6\cdot 10^5$, leading to a cavity linewidth of $3.0\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and a $Q$ factor of $1.7\cdot 10^{11}$. Frequency stabilization was demonstrated using a cavity mode in a spectral transparency region near the center of the inhomogeneous profile, showing an overlapping Allan deviation below $6\cdot 10^{-14}$ and a linear drift rate of $3.66\,\mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{s}$. Considering improvements that could be implemented, this makes the europium-based slow light laser frequency reference a promising candidate for ultra-precise tabletop frequency stabilization.</description>

Abstract: We present a practical scheme for the efficient preparation of laser-cooled $^{43}$Ca$^+$ ions in an ion trap. Our approach integrates two well-established methods: isotope-selective photoionization and isotope-specific parametric excitation. Drawing inspiration from the individual merits of each method, we have successfully integrated these techniques to prepare extended chains of $^{43}$Ca$^+$ ions, overcoming the challenge posed by their low natural abundance of 0.135\% in a natural source. Furthermore, we explore the subtleties of our scheme, focusing on the influence of different factors on the purification process. Our investigation contributes to a broader understanding of the technique and highlights the adaptability of established methods in addressing specific isotopic challenges.</description>

      <title>Realization of a magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color dipole trap with sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap that allows us to generate a periodic one-dimensional array of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half of the resonant wavelength of the cesium D2-line. To this end, we launch a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We demonstrate the trapping of atoms in the array and characterize the resulting trap configuration by measuring the trap frequencies in three directions and observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects such as selective radiance in 1D atomic arrays.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein Relations between Absorption and Emission Spectra at Thermodynamic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Einstein coefficient spectra and a detailed-balance derivation of generalized Einstein relations between them that is based on the connection between spontaneous and stimulated emission. If two broadened levels or bands overlap in energy, transitions between them need not be purely absorptive or emissive. Consequently, spontaneous emission can occur in both transition directions, and four Einstein coefficient spectra replace the three Einstein coefficients for a line. At equilibrium, the four different spectra obey five pairwise relationships and one lineshape generates all four. These relationships are independent of molecular quantum statistics and predict the Stokes' shift between forward and reverse transitions required by equilibrium with blackbody radiation. For Boltzmann statistics, the relative strengths of forward and reverse transitions depend on the formal chemical potential difference between the initial and final bands, which becomes the standard chemical potential difference for ideal solutes. The formal chemical potential of a band replaces both the energy and degeneracy of a quantum level. Like the energies of quantum levels, the formal chemical potentials of bands obey the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle. Each stimulated Einstein coefficient spectrum gives a frequency-dependent transition cross section. Transition cross sections obey causality and a detailed-balance condition with spontaneous emission, but do not directly obey generalized Einstein relations. Even with an energetic width much less than the photon energy, an absorptive forward transition with an energetic width much greater than the thermal energy can have such an extreme Stokes' shift that its reverse transition cross section becomes predominantly absorptive rather than emissive.</description>
