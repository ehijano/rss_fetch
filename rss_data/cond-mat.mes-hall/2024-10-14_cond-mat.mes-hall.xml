      <title>The Ultra-critical Floquet Non-Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that periodically driven Fermions coupled to simple bosonic baths have steady state occupations of Floquet Bloch bands that generically display non-analyticties at certain momenta which resemble the Fermi surfaces of equilibrium non-Fermi liquids. Remarkably these non-equilibrium Fermi surfaces remain sharp even when the bath is at finite temperature, leading to critical power-law decaying correlations at finite temperature, a phenomenon with no analogue in equilibrium. We also show that generically there is in-gap current rectification for clean metals lacking inversion symmetry, and explain why this occurs universally regardless of the details of collisions.</description>

      <title>Sub-Kelvin Extension of the Theoretical Limit of MOSFET Subthreshold Swing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical limit of subthreshold swing in MOSFETs is extended down to sub-Kelvin temperatures. By including the band and band-tail states, the existence of a new phase 4 is derived from the theory. In phase 4, the subthreshold swing plateaus again when the Fermi level saturates inside the band. The model for subthreshold swing in phase 4 is proportional to a Fermi voltage instead of the thermal voltage. A short formula for the slope factor in phase 3 is also derived which allows to extract the subband density-of-states and effective mass. The phase-4 model allows to extract the Fermi level position. The proposed theoretical model is validated against experimental data from the recent literature. Even for a sharp band edge, the theory predicts that the subthreshold swing deviates from the Boltzmann thermal limit at sub-Kelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Topological magnonic properties of an antiferromagnetic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnonic excitations of a dimerized, one-dimensional, antiferromagnetic chain can be trivial or topological depending on the signs and magnitudes of the alternating exchange couplings and the anisotropy. The topological phase that occurs when the signs of the two different exchange couplings alternate is qualitatively different from that of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. A material that may exhibit these properties is the quasi-one-dimensional material MoI$_3$ that consists of dimerized chains weakly coupled to adjacent chains. The magnetic ground state and its excitations are analyzed both analytically and numerically using exchange and anisotropy parameters extracted from density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Optical Orientation of Mn$^{2+}$ Spins in Bulk (Zn, Mn)Se Induced by Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical orientation of Mn$^{2+}$ spins in the first excited state $^4$T$_1$ was experimentally observed in bulk (Zn, Mn)Se ($x_\mathrm{Mn}=0.01$) in the an external magnetic field of up to $6\,$T in Faraday geometry. This occurred during quasi-resonant continuous wave circularly polarized photoexcitation of the intracenter d-d transitions. A non-monotonic dependence of the thermal circular polarization of the intracenter photoluminescence on the magnetic field was observed. A theoretical model is proposed to describe the selection rules for resonant optical d-d transitions of an isolated Mn$^{2+}$ ion in a ZnSe cubic crystal. These rules are based on the analysis of the total angular momentum symmetry for the ground ($^6$A$_1$) and first excited ($^4$T$_1$) states of the Mn$^{2+}$ ion. This discussion neglects the specific mechanism for spin-flip processes in a d-shell of the ion during optical excitation. The analysis is founded on the rotational symmetry of the effective total angular momenta and parity for each state as a whole. Additionally, the Jahn-Teller coupling of the excited state orbital parts with tetragonal ($e$-type) local distortions of the crystal lattice is considered. This coupling results in the segregation of cubic axes and spin projections on these axes due to weak spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling in the excited state. This leads to energy splitting for spin states with their projections of $\pm 1/2$ and $\pm 3/2$ on each axis distinguished by specific Jahn-Teller distortion in the corresponding atomic potential minimum. By introducing two different times of relaxation to reach thermodynamic equilibrium for $\pm 1/2$ and $\pm 3/2$ states in each Jahn-Teller configuration, an angle dependent optical orientation contribution in photoluminescence polarization arises in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Mediated Nonlinear Optical Responses and Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the complexities of nonlinear optical (NLO) responses, particularly the intricate many-body interactions among photons, electrons, and phonons, remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a diagrammatic approach to explore NLO responses with electron-phonon coupling (EPC), focusing on the phonon-mediated nonlinear optical (Ph-NLO) responses up to the second order in photon perturbation. We systematically analyze the shift and ballistic mechanisms responsible for phonon-mediated electron-photon interactions. By incorporating EPC effects, we elucidate phenomena such as phonon-mediated shift current (Ph-SC) and second-harmonic generation (Ph-SHG) in a comprehensive Ph-NLO framework. This approach enables below-gap resonant responses at terahertz photon frequencies, offering a promising mechanism for terahertz optical applications that surpasses the constraints of conventional pure-electronic NLO theories. Additionally, we explore the geometric and topological consequences of Ph-NLO responses by introducing the EPC Berry curvature, EPC quantum metric, and EPC shift vector. These concepts unveil a unique quantum geometric structure within the Hilbert space, parameterized by both the electronic wavevector and phonon-displacement, thereby extending the established pure-electronic quantum geometry. Using a general Rice-Mele model, we demonstrate the connection between Ph-NLO responses and EPC geometry, discussing the implications and predicting observable effects for future experimental validation. This framework also provides a foundation for advancing first-principles calculations aimed at the discovery and engineering of NLO materials. The insights gained from this study contribute to a more profound understanding of NLO responses and EPC quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Energy Bands of Incommensurate Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy band theory is a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics. According to conventional wisdom, discrete translational symmetry is mandatory for defining energy bands. Here, we illustrate that, in fact, the concept of energy band can be generalized to incommensurate systems lacking such symmetry, thus transcending the traditional paradigm of energy band. The validity of our theory is verified by extensive numerical calculations in the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model and a two-dimensional incommensurate model of graphene. Building upon the proposed concept of incommensurate energy bands, we further develop a theory of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) for incommensurate systems, providing a clear physical picture for the incommensurate ARPES spectra. Our work establishes a comprehensive energy band theory for incommensurate systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion Dynamics in Co/Pt Nanocontacts for Spintronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected quasiparticles and have drawn much attention because of their potential applications in next-generation spintronics devices. Their inherent topological stability, nanoscale size, and efficient manipulation via spin currents make them promising candidates for high-density data storage and novel computing paradigms. We micromagnetically investigate the nucleation dynamics of magnetic skyrmion pairs excited underneath two 30 nm nanocontacts with varying separations on top of an extended Co/Pt bilayer thin film. At close separation of 100 nm, the magnetization configurations strongly interact, giving rise to the formation of stable merged skyrmion states. As the separation increases beyond 200 nm, topologically distinct metastable configurations emerge, including the coexistence of tunable skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) strengths and current pulse amplitudes. These metastable states eventually relax into two stable skyrmions that can be independently toggled ON and OFF using a weak in-plane magnetic field, enabling complex logic operations and more flexible circuit designs. Beyond the fundamental interest in skyrmion interaction dynamics, the independent control of skyrmion-antiskyrmion states holds promise for next-generation spintronic devices, with potential applications in memory, logic, and computing.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied by particles (depleted). This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry-induced radiative heat transfer in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional fluctuational electrodynamics describing thermal radiation from bodies at local equilibrium may break down in Floquet-driven systems. We develop a general microscopic theory to account for the out-of-equilibrium states of photons induced by electronic fluctuations in periodically driven systems and the associated radiative heat transfer between objects. The nonequilibrium occupation of radiative photons in Floquet states follows an exponential-staircase distribution, with the nonequilibrium thermal distribution sensitive to the electronic properties of the material. We further show significant heat transfer between two parallel metal plates with different microscopic properties, despite identical driving protocols and bath temperatures. This work opens up new opportunities for the directional manipulation of radiative heat transfer in Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological phases in an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, higher order hopping and domain wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate emergent topological phases in an extended spin-full Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model considering Rashba spin-orbit interaction, all possible complex next to next nearest neighbor (NNNN) hopping preserving Chiral symmetry. Our analysis finds exact condition for which the topological phases of both the spin sectors could be independently varied. We show that it necessarily depends on complex NNNN only. We elaborate in detail the emergent topological phases, its criteria through analytic determination of non-trivial gap-closing condition due to the presence of $\cos 2k$ term. We also find that the profile of topological edge modes for finite winding numbers depend non-monotonously on the value of NNNN hopping elucidating competing effect of model parameters. We extend our study to few coupled chains and show explicitly that depending on the parameters all possible winding number ranging from zero to $2N$ could be obtained, where $N$ is the number of chains considered. Finally we incorporate the study of domain wall and remarkably we find that the location of mid-gap zero energy state by changing the values of model parameters. Our study could be of immensely useful for future applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of all two-dimensional fragile topological bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing topological materials with specific topological indices is a complex inverse problem, traditionally tackled through manual, intuition-driven methods that are neither scalable nor efficient for exploring the vast space of possible material configurations. In this work, we develop an algorithm that leverages the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy to optimize the Fourier representation of the periodic functions shaping the designer material's characteristics. This includes mass profiles or dielectric tensors for phononic and photonic crystals, respectively, as much as synthetic potentials applicable to electronic and ultra-cold atomic systems. We demonstrate our methodology with a detailed characterization of a class of topological bands known as "fragile topological", showcasing the algorithm's capability to address both topological characteristics and spectral quality. This automation not only streamlines the design process but also significantly expands the potential for identifying and constructing high quality designer topological materials across the wide range of platforms, and is readily extendable to other setups, including higher-dimensional and non-linear systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Antibimerons: Statics and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nontrivial topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, are of great interest due to their potential use as information carriers in spintronic memory and logic. Here, we theoretically predict an asymmetric antibimeron (AAB) -- a topological texture in an in-plane magnetized chiral ferromagnet with $D_{2d}$ symmetry, which is yet to be observed experimentally. We show that it can be stabilized by an anisotropic interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction found in materials with $D_{2d}$ symmetry. Using energy considerations, we explain its asymmetric shape formed of an antivortex and a crescent-shaped vortex of opposite core polarizations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AABs of opposite topological charge can be stabilized within the same ferromagnetic film, unlike skyrmions in out-of-plane magnetized films. Employing micromagnetic simulations and analytical Thiele's equation approach, we also investigate current-driven dynamics of the AABs, in particular showing that the topological charge of the system can be controllably changed in AAB collisions. Our results shed light on fundamental understanding of asymmetric topological magnetic solitons and provide guidance for their experimental observation in in-plane magnetized ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Extreme electron-hole drag and negative mobility in the Dirac plasma of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb drag between adjacent electron and hole gases has attracted considerable attention, being studied in various two-dimensional systems, including semiconductor and graphene heterostructures. Here we report measurements of electron-hole drag in the Planckian plasma that develops in monolayer graphene in the vicinity of its Dirac point above liquid-nitrogen temperatures. The frequent electron-hole scattering forces minority carriers to move against the applied electric field due to the drag induced by majority carriers. This unidirectional transport of electrons and holes results in nominally negative mobility for the minority carriers. The electron-hole drag is found to be strongest near-room temperature, despite being notably affected by phonon scattering. Our findings provide better understanding of the transport properties of charge-neutral graphene, reveal limits on its hydrodynamic description and also offer insight into quantum-critical systems in general.</description>

      <title>Probing topological phases in a perturbed Kane-Mele model via RKKY interaction: Application to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) are promising for spintronics, leveraging strong spin-orbit coupling for efficient spin manipulation via electrical and optical methods, with potential applications in memory storage, quantum computing, and spin-based logic. While the Kane-Mele model effectively captures the low-energy physics of these materials, the impact of perturbations driving phase transitions is less well understood. Developing approaches to describe these phases is crucial. Here, we study the noncollinear Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic impurities in a \textit{perturbed} Kane-Mele model with strong spin-orbit coupling, relevant to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ as a prominent QSHI. By analyzing RKKY interactions, we reveal distinct, relative (rather than absolute) signatures of the different phase transitions induced by static and dynamic perturbations based on their impact on magnetic impurities. We then employ these perturbations to switch between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic or clockwise and counterclockwise magnetic interactions for control processes. Our results offer a practical way to track topological phases via magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Kinetic uncertainty relations for quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the precision of currents in a generic multi-terminal quantum-transport setting. Employing scattering theory, we show that the precision of the currents is limited by a function of the particle-current noise that can be interpreted as the activity in the classical limit. We thereby establish a kinetic uncertainty relation for quantum transport. In the full quantum limit, we find precision bounds in which we modify the activity constraints depending on whether the system is fermionic or bosonic. We expect these bounds to be guidelines for any transport process aiming at high precision.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Electronic Transitions to Ferroelectric Order in a 2D Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ferroelectric material often exhibits a soft transvers optical (TO) phonon mode which governs it phase transition. Charge coupling to this ferroelectric soft mode may further mediate emergent physical properties, including superconductivity and defect tolerance. However, direct experimental evidence for such coupling is scarce. Here we show that a photo-launched coherent phonon couples strongly to electronic transitions across the bandgap in the van der Waals (vdW) two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we identify this mode as the TO phonon responsible for ferroelectric order. This exclusive coupling occurs only with above-gap electronic transition and is absent in the valence band as revealed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering. Our findings suggest a new role of the soft TO phonon mode in electronic and optical properties of ferroelectric semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify and classify topologically protected singularities for the reflection coefficient of transdimensional plasmonic systems. Originating from nonlocal electromagnetic response due to vertical electron confinement in the system, such singularities lead to lateral (angular) Goos-H\"anchen shifts on the millimeter (milliradian) scale in the visible range, greatly exceeding those reported previously for artificially designed metasurfaces, offering new opportunities for quantum material development.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic and Mechanical Properties of the Recently Synthesized Nitrogen-Doped Monolayer Amorphous Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent synthesis of nitrogen-doped monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC @N) opens new possibilities for multifunctional materials. In this study, we have investigated the nitrogen doping limits and their effects on MAC@N's structural and electronic properties using density functional-based tight-binding simulations. Our results show that MAC@N remains stable up to 35\% nitrogen doping, beyond which the lattice becomes unstable. The formation energies of MAC@N are higher than those of nitrogen-doped graphene for all the cases we have investigated. Both undoped MAC and MAC@N exhibit metallic behavior, although only MAC features a Dirac-like cone. MAC has an estimated Young's modulus value of about 410 GPa, while MAC@N's modulus can vary around 416 GPa depending on nitrogen content. MAC displays optical activity in the ultraviolet range, whereas MAC@N features light absorption within the infrared and visible ranges, suggesting potential for distinct optoelectronic applications. Their structural thermal stabilities were addressed through molecular dynamics simulations. MAC melts at approximately 4900K, while MAC@N loses its structural integrity for temperatures ranging from 300K to 3300K, lower than graphene. These results point to potential MAC@N applications in flexible electronics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Trapped Nanocrystals with Symmetry-Preserving Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of nanocrystals is crucial in determining their surface area, reactivity, optical properties, mechanical strength, and self-assembly behavior. Traditionally, shape control has been achieved through empirical methods, highlighting the need for a more refined theoretical framework. A comprehensive model should account for the kinetic factors at distinct stages of the shape-formation process to identify the key determinants of nanocrystal morphology. By modulating kinetics at terraces, ledges, and kinks, we reveal that the primary factors are the adatom nucleation energies and the geometry of growth islands. Transient sites dominate the growth process, leading to kinetically trapped, metastable shapes. We illustrate these concepts with face-centered cubic nanocrystals, demonstrating diverse shape evolutions, including surface roughening and the preservation of crystal symmetry in cubes, octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and their truncated variants. This study reveals the mechanisms driving the formation of cubic nanocrystal shapes and offers guidance for their precise synthesis.</description>

      <title>Large Chiral Orbital Texture and Orbital Edelstein Effect in Co/Al Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments by S. Krishnia et al., Nano Lett. 23, 6785 (2023) reported an unprecedentedly large enhancement of torques upon inserting thin Al layer in Co/Pt heterostructure that suggested the presence of a Rashba-like interaction at the metallic Co/Al interface. Based on first-principles calculations, we reveal the emergence of a large helical orbital texture in reciprocal space at the interfacial Co layer, whose origin is attributed to the orbital Rashba effect due to the formation of the surface states at the Co/Al interface and where spin-orbit coupling is found to produce smaller contributions with a higher-order winding of the orbital momentum. Our results unveil that the orbital texture gives rise to a non-equilibrium orbital accumulation producing large current-induced torques, thus providing an essential theoretical background for the experimental data and advancing the use of orbital transport phenomena in all-metallic magnetic systems with light elements.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general approach for deriving transparent boundary conditions for the stationary Schroedinger equation with arbitrary potential. It is proven that the transparent boundary conditions can be written in terms of the Weyl-Titchmarsh coefficients. As examples for the application of the proposed approach, two special cases for the stationary Schroedinger equation with the harmonic potential and the Poeschl-Teller potential are considered.</description>

      <title>Negative piezoelectricity in quasi-two/one-dimensional ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of low-dimensional ferroelectrics has attracted great attention for their promising applications in nano devices. Piezoelectricity is one of the most core properties of ferroelectric materials, which plays the essential role in micro-electromechanical systems. Very recently, the anomalous negative piezoelectricity has been predicted/discovered in many quasi-two-dimensional layered ferroelectric materials. In this Topical Review, we will briefly introduce on the negative piezoelectricity in quasi-two/one-dimensional ferroelectrics, including its fundamental concept, typical materials, theoretical predictions, as well as experimental phenomena. The underlying physical mechanisms for negative piezoelectricity are divergent and varying from case by case, which can be categorized into four types. First, the soft van der Waals layer is responsible for the volume shrinking upon pressure while the electric dipoles is from non van der Waals layer. Second, the noncollinearity of local dipoles creates a ferrielectricity, which leads to orthogonal ferroelectric and antiferroelectric axes. Third, the electric dipoles come from interlayer/interchain couplings, which can be enhanced during the volume shrinking. Fourth, the special buckling structure contributes to local dipoles, which can be enhanced upon pressure. In real materials, more than one mechanism may work together. Finally, the future directions of negative piezoelectricity and their potential applications are outlooked.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable nonlocal Josephson effect through magnetic van der Waals bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. Especially, we introduce a bracket transformation that makes the calculation of high-order correction drives feasible. We apply our method to engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Dispersion effects in thermal emission from temporal metamaterials: High-frequency cut-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest breakthroughs in time-varying photonics are fueling novel thermal emission phenomena, for example, showing that the dynamic amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations, induced by the time-modulation of material properties, enables a mechanism to surpass the black-body spectrum. So far, this issue has only been investigated under the assumption of non-dispersive time-modulations. In this work, we identify the existence of a non-physical diverging behavior in the time-modulated emission spectra at high frequencies, and prove that it is actually attributed to the simplistic assumption of a non-dispersive (temporally local) response of the time-modulation associated with memory-less systems. Accordingly, we upgrade the theoretical formalism by introducing a dispersive response function, showing that it leads to a high-frequency cut-off, thereby eliminating the divergence and hence allowing for the proper computation of the emission spectra of time-modulated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital version of adiabatic quantum computing enhanced by counterdiabatic driving, known as digitized counterdiabatic quantum computing, has emerged as a paradigm that opens the door to fast and low-depth algorithms. In this work, we explore the extension of this paradigm to high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we consider qutrits in the context of quadratic problems, obtaining the qutrit Hamiltonian codifications and the counterdiabatic drivings. Our findings show that the use of qutrits can improve the quality of the solution up to 90 times compared to qubits counterpart. We test our proposal on 1000 random instances of the multi-way number partitioning, max 3-cut, and portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating that, in general, without prior knowledge, it is always better to use high-dimensional systems instead of qubits. Finally, considering the state-of-the-art in quantum platforms, we show the experimental feasibility of our high-dimensional counterdiabatic quantum algorithms at least in a full digital form. This work paves the way for the efficient codification of optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces and their efficient implementation using counterdiabatic quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent sensitivity of quantum sensors to their physical environment can make them good reporters of parameters such as temperature, pressure, strain, and electric fields. Here, we present a molecular platform for pressure (P) and temperature (T) sensing using para-terphenyl crystals doped with pentacene. We leverage the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of the photoexcited triplet electron in the pentacene molecule, that serves as a sensitive probe for lattice changes in the host para-terphenyl due to pressure or temperature variations. We observe maximal ODMR frequency variations of df/dP=1.8 MHz/bar and df/dT=247 kHz/K, which are over 1,200 times and three times greater, respectively, than those seen in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. This results in a &gt;85-fold improvement in pressure sensitivity over best previously reported. The larger variation reflects the weaker nature of the para-terphenyl lattice, with first-principles DFT calculations indicating that even picometer-level shifts in the molecular orbitals due to P, T changes are measurable. The platform offers additional advantages including high levels of sensor doping, narrow ODMR linewidths and high contrasts, and ease of deployment, leveraging the ability for large single crystals at low cost. Overall, this work paves the way for low-cost, optically-interrogated pressure and temperature sensors and lays the foundation for even more versatile sensors enabled by synthetic tunability in designer molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitter interacting with a dispersive dielectric object: a model based on the modified Langevin noise formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the interaction of a quantum emitter with a finite-size dispersive dielectric object in an unbounded space within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, using the modified Langevin noise formalism. The quantized electromagnetic field consists of two contributions: the medium-assisted field, which accounts for the electromagnetic field generated by the noise polarization currents of the dielectric, and the scattering-assisted field, which takes into account the electromagnetic field incoming from infinity and scattered by the dielectric. We show that the emitter couples to two distinct bosonic baths: a medium-assisted bath and a scattering-assisted bath, each characterized by its own spectral density. We identify the conditions under which the electromagnetic environment composed of these two baths can be effectively replaced by a single bosonic bath, ensuring that the reduced dynamics of the quantum emitter remain unchanged. In particular, when the initial states of the medium- and scattering-assisted baths are thermal states with the same temperature, we find that a single bosonic bath with a spectral density equal to the sum of the medium-assisted and scattering-assisted spectral densities is equivalent to the original electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of the formation of Landau levels based on the Schr\"odinger equation for electrons constrained to curved surfaces have a long history. These include as prime examples surfaces with constant positive and negative curvature, the sphere [Phys. Rev. Lett. 51, 605 (1983)] and the pseudosphere [Annals of Physics 173, 185 (1987)]. Now, topological insulators, hosting Dirac-type surface states, provide a unique platform to experimentally examine such quantum Hall physics in curved space. Hence, extending previous work we consider solutions of the Dirac equation for the pseudosphere for both, the case of an overall perpendicular magnetic field and a homogeneous coaxial, thereby locally varying, magnetic field. For both magnetic-field configurations, we provide analytical solutions for spectra and eigenstates. For the experimentally relevant case of a coaxial magnetic field we find that the Landau levels split and show a peculiar scaling $\propto B^{1/4}$, thereby characteristically differing from the usual linear $B$ and $B^{1/2}$ dependence of the planar Schr\"odinger and Dirac case, respectively. We compare our analytical findings to numerical results that we also extend to the case of the Minding surface.</description>

      <title>Braids and Higher-order Exceptional Points from the Interplay Between Lossy Defects and Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the perturbation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by a localized lossy defect leads to higher-order exceptional points (HOEP). Depending on the location of the defect, third- and fourth- order exceptional points (EP3 \&amp; EP4) appear in the space of Hamiltonian parameters. On the one hand, they arise due to the non-Abelian braiding properties of exceptional lines (EL) in parameter space. Namely, the HOEPs lie at intersections of mutually non-commuting ELs. On the other hand, we show that such special intersections happen due to the fact that the delocalization of edge states, induced by the non-Hermitian defect, hybridizes them with defect states. These can then coalesce together into an EP3. When the defect lies at the midpoint of the chain, a special symmetry of the full spectrum can lead to an EP4. In this way, our model illustrates the emergence of interesting non-Abelian topological properties in the multiband structure of non-Hermitian perturbations of topological phases.</description>

      <title>A $C^\ast$-algebraic view on the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals is an open problem. We approach it from the viewpoint of $C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism. On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.</description>

      <title>Magnetism measurements of two-dimensional van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4 using dynamic cantilever magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical work has focused on two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) magnets due to their potential applications in sensing and spintronics devises. In measurements of these emerging materials, conventional magnetometry often encounters challenges in characterizing the magnetic properties of small-sized vdW materials, especially for antiferromagnets with nearly compensated magnetic moments. Here, we investigate the magnetism of 2D antiferromagnet CrPS4 with a thickness of 8nm by using dynamic cantilever magnetometry (DCM). Through a combination of DCM experiment and the calculation based on a Stoner--Wohlfarth-type model, we unravel the magnetization states in 2D CrPS4 antiferromagnet. In the case of H parallel with c, a two-stage phase transition is observed. For H perpendicular to c, a hump in the effective magnetic restoring force is noted, which implies the presence of spin reorientation as temperature increases. These results demonstrate the benefits of DCM for studying magnetism of 2D magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous spin and orbital Hall phenomena in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials via orbital pumping experiments. Conducting spin and orbital pumping experiments on YIG/Pt/Ir20Mn80 heterostructures, we unexpectedly observe strong spin and orbital anomalous signals in an out-of-plane configuration. We report a sevenfold increase in the signal of the anomalous inverse orbital Hall effect (AIOHE) compared to conventional effects. Our study suggests expanding the Orbital Hall angle ({\theta}_OH) to a rank 3 tensor, akin to the Spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH), to explain AIOHE. This work pioneers converting spin-orbital currents into charge current, advancing the spin-orbitronics domain in AF materials.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of bulk currents in the quantized Hall regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect can be observed in a two-dimensional conductor penetrated by a perpendicular magnetic field and with edges connecting the current carrying contacts. Its signature is a state of quantized Hall and simultaneously vanishing longitudinal resistances. A widely accepted model is the Landauer-B\"uttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by current carrying one-dimensional edge channels. This single-particle model is challenged by the screening theory. It derives, that electron-electron interaction leads to a fragmentation of the Hall bar into compressible and incompressible strips, where the latter gradually shift from the sample edges into the bulk with increasing magnetic field. This suggests a transition from edge to bulk current if we associate current flow with incompressible strips. We present a direct experimental proof of this transition from edge to bulk current. Our results support the screening theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium transport through interacting superconducting nanojunctions using a Liouville space approach. The formalism allows us to study finite gap effects, and to account for both quasiparticle and Cooper pair tunneling. With focus on the weak tunneling limit, we study the stationary dc and ac current up to second order (cotunneling) in the hybridization energy. We identify the characteristic virtual processes that yield the Andreev and Josephson current and obtain the dependence on the gate and bias voltage for the dc current, the critical current and the phase-dependent dissipative current. In particular, the critical current is characterized by regions in the stability diagram in which its sign changes from positive to negative, resulting in a multitude of 0-\pi transitions. The latter signal the interplay between strong interactions and tunneling at finite bias.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Bottlenecks in Impedance Spectroscopy due to Transient Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impedance spectroscopy is vital for material characterization and assessing electrochemical device performance. It provides real-time analysis of dynamic processes such as electrode kinetics, electrons, holes or ion transport, and interfacial or defect driven phenomena. However, the technique is sensitive to experimental conditions, introducing potential variability in results. The intricate interplay of transient effects within the realm of spectral impedance analyses introduces a layer of complexity that may impede straightforward interpretations. This demands a nuanced approach for refining analytical methodologies and ensuring the fidelity of impedance characterization once the dynamic contributions of transient ingredients cannot be disentangled from the underlying steady-state characteristics. In our study, we experimentally identify that the transient effects in a memristor device are most pronounced near an optimal frequency related to intrinsic relaxation times, with these effects diminishing as the frequency varies beyond or below this range. While inherent systematic errors impose a practical limit (accuracy floor) on achievable measurement accuracy, this paper offers qualitative and quantitative insights into how specific procedures affect this limit and how to reduce it in orders of magnitude. Only by effectively addressing these errors we can push beyond this constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) belongs to the most fundamental phenomena of solid state physics and has an important application as resistance standard. It serves as a basis to understand the fractional, anomalous or spin QHEs, candidates for applications in quantum technology due to their topological properties. For optimizing all these applications it is essential to understand the current distribution inside the Hall bar, a question disputed for decades. We perform multiterminal current measurements on a Hall bar and compare the results with limiting models. We show, based on these simple experiments, that the current flow is chiral for the plateaus of quantized Hall resistance. Everywhere else, the current is described by the Drude model.</description>

      <title>Extreme Enhancement-Mode Operation Accumulation Channel Hydrogen-Terminated Diamond FETs with $V_{th} &lt; -6V$ and High On-Current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a new Field Effect Transistor device concept based on hydrogen-terminated diamond (H-diamond) that operates in an Accumulation Channel rather than Transfer Doping regime. Our FET devices demonstrate both extreme enhancement-mode operation and high on-current with improved channel charge mobility compared to Transfer-Doped equivalents. Electron-beam evaporated $Al_2O_3$ is used on H-diamond to suppress the Transfer Doping mechanism and produce an extremely high ungated channel resistance. A high-quality H-diamond surface with an unpinned Fermi level is crucially achieved, allowing for formation of a high-density hole accumulation layer by gating the entire device channel which is encapsulated in dual-stacks of $Al_2O_3$. Completed devices with gate/channel length of $1 \mu m$ demonstrate record threshold voltage $&lt; -6 V$ with on-current $&gt; 80 mA/mm$. Carrier density and mobility figures extracted by CV analysis indicate high 2D charge density of $~ 2 \times 10^{12} cm^{-2}$ and increased hole mobility of $110 cm^2 /V \cdot s$ in comparison with more traditional Transfer-Doped H-diamond FETs. These results demonstrate the most negative threshold voltage yet reported for H-diamond FETs and highlight a new strategy for the development of high-performance power devices that better exploit diamond's intrinsic dielectric properties and high hole mobility.</description>

Abstract: Anomalous metallic behavior is often observed near superconductor-insulator quantum critical points and, if persistent to zero temperature, poses a challenge to current theories of metals. One explanation for this behavior could be incomplete thermal equilibrium between the sample and the cryostat. However, despite decades of study, the temperature of an anomalous metal has not yet been measured. We introduce a new experimental probe by capturing microwave radiation emitted from the anomalous metal, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. The total emitted radiation exceeds the limits of thermodynamic equilibrium, and is well described by an elevated sample temperature. The extracted sample temperature matches the onset of anomalous metallic behavior. Additionally, we discover scaling behavior of radiative noise in the presence of an applied bias. Elements of our noise-scaling observations were predicted based on nonlinear critical field theories and gauge-gravity duality between current noise and Hawking radiation from a black hole. This work shows that, in a prominent model system, anomalous metallic behavior is a non-equilibrium effect, and opens a new frontier in the study of universal, non-equilibrium phenomena near quantum criticality.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor crosshatch patterns in thin film heterostructures form as a result of strain relaxation processes and dislocation pile-ups during growth of lattice mismatched materials. Due to their connection with the internal misfit dislocation network, these crosshatch patterns are a complex fingerprint of internal strain relaxation and growth anisotropy. Therefore, this mesoscopic fingerprint not only describes the residual strain state of a near-surface quantum well, but also could provide an indicator of the quality of electron transport through the material. Here, we present a method utilizing computer vision and machine learning to analyze AFM crosshatch patterns that exhibits this correlation. Our analysis reveals optimized electron transport for moderate values of $\lambda$ (crosshatch wavelength) and $\epsilon$ (crosshatch height), roughly 1 $\mu$m and 4 nm, respectively, that define the average waveform of the pattern. Simulated 2D AFM crosshatch patterns are used to train a machine learning model to correlate the crosshatch patterns to dislocation density. Furthermore, this model is used to evaluate the experimental AFM images and predict a dislocation density based on the crosshatch waveform. Predicted dislocation density, experimental AFM crosshatch data, and experimental transport characterization are used to train a final model to predict 2D electron gas mean free path. This model shows electron scattering is strongly correlated with elastic effects (e.g. dislocation scattering) below 200 nm $\lambda_{MFP}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically protected corner states serve as a key indicator for two-dimensional higher-order topological insulators, yet they have not been experimentally identified in realistic materials. Here, by utilizing the effective tight-binding model and symmetry arguments, we establish a connection between higher-order topological insulators and twisted bilayer kagome lattices. We find that the topologically nontrivial bulk band gap arises in the twisted bilayer kagome lattice system due to twist-induced intervalley scattering, leading to the emergence of higher-order topological insulators with a range of commensurate twist angles, and the higher-order band topology is verified by the second Stiefel-Whitney number and fractionally quantized corner charges. Moreover, we investigate the influence of disorder and charge density wave order on the stability of higher-order topological insulator phases. The results show that the corner states of twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems are robust with respect to disorder and charge density wave. Our work not only provides a feasible approach to realize the readily controllable higher-order topological insulator phases by employing a simple twist technique, but also demonstrates that the twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems exhibit the robustness of higher-order band topology, making it feasible to check above prediction in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider a quantum topological frequency converter, realized by coupling a qubit to two slow harmonic modes. The dynamics of such a system is the quantum analog of topological pumping. Our quantum mechanical description shows that an initial state generically evolves into a superposition of two adiabatic states. The topological nature of the coupling between the qubit and the modes splits these two components apart in energy: for each component, an energy transfer at a quantized rate occurs between the two quantum modes, in opposite directions for the two components, reminiscent of the topological pumping. We denote such a superposition of two quantum adiabatic states distinguishable through measures of the modes' energy an adiabatic cat state. We show that the topological coupling enhances the entanglement between the qubit and the modes, and we unveil the role of the quantum or Fubini-Study metric in the characterization of this entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Most periodic systems are governed by short-range interactions as long-range interactions in these systems diminish uniformly. In this letter, however, we demonstrate that this is not true for a more general class of systems, which possess long-range order without periodicity, known as quasiperiodic systems. Quasiperiodicity alters the well-known characteristics of the long-range couplings, resulting in anomalous enhancement for arbitrarily long distances, even beyond the mesoscopic scale. By exemplifying the indirect spin exchange interaction, we show that the long-range coupling in a quasiperiodic chain does not attenuate over distance but is instead governed by a novel distance metric, we have named the hyperspace geometric distance. This enables us to remotely control the spins over even mesoscopic distances. Our work provides new paradigms of strongly correlated physics applicable to a broader class of systems beyond the conventional ones.</description>

Abstract: Despite its abundance in nature, predicting the occurrence of ferromagnetism in the ground state is possible only under very limited conditions such as in a flat band system with repulsive interaction or in a band with a single hole under infinitely large Coulomb repulsion, etc. Here, we propose a general condition to achieve saturated ferromagnetism based on the quantum geometry of electronic wave functions in itinerant electron systems. By analyzing the spin excitations of multi-band repulsive Hubbard models with an integer band filling, relevant to either ferromagnetic insulators or semimetals, we show that quantum geometry stabilizes the Goldstone mode in the strongly correlated limit. Our theory indicates the stability of ferromagnetism in a large class of insulators and semimetals other than the previously studied flat band systems and their variants. Moreover, we rigorously prove that saturated ferromagnetism is forbidden in any system with trivial quantum geometry, which includes every half-filled system. We believe that our findings reveal a profound connection between quantum geometry and ferromagnetism, which can be extended to various symmetry-broken ground states in itinerant electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Stabilization of Fractional Chern Insulators Far from the Ideal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of strong electronic interactions, a partially filled Chern band may stabilize a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state, the zero-field analog of the fractional quantum Hall phase. While FCIs have long been hypothesized, feasible solid-state realizations only recently emerged, largely due to the rise of moir\'e materials. In these systems, the quantum geometry of the electronic bands plays a critical role in stabilizing the FCI in the presence of competing correlated phases. In the limit of ``ideal'' quantum geometry, where the quantum geometry is identical to that of Landau levels, this role is well understood. However, in more realistic scenarios only empiric numerical evidence exists, accentuating the need for a clear understanding of the mechanism by which the FCI deteriorates moving further away from these ideal conditions. We introduce and analyze an anisotropic model of a $\left|C \right|=1$ Chern insulator, whereupon partial filling of its bands, an FCI phase is stabilized over a certain parameter regime. We incorporate strong electronic interaction analytically by employing a coupled-wires approach, studying the FCI stability and its relation to the the quantum metric. We identify an unusual anti-FCI phase benefiting from non-ideal geometry, generically subdominant to the FCI. However, its presence hinders the formation of FCI in favor of other competitive phases at fractional fillings, such as the charge density wave. Though quite peculiar, this anti-FCI phase may have already been observed in experiments at high magnetic fields. This establish a direct link between quantum geometry and FCI stability in a tractable model far from any ideal band conditions, and illuminates a unique mechanism of FCI deterioration.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced dissipative quantum phase transition in a head-to-tail atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the interatomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Superconductivity of oxide nanojunctions using fractional Shapiro steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss the emergence of fractional Shapiro steps in a Josephson junction created by confining a two-dimensional electron gas at an oxide interface. This phenomenon is induced by an alternating current of proper amplitude and frequency and can be tuned by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Rashba spin-orbit axis. The presence of fractional Shapiro steps can be associated with the creation of Majorana bound states at the boundaries of the superconducting leads. Our findings represent a route for the identification of topological superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric materials and confined systems in the presence of spin--orbit interaction, offering also new insights into recently explored frameworks.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>
