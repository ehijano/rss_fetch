      <title>Exploring Scotogenic Parameter Spaces and Mapping Uncharted Dark Matter Phenomenology with Multi-Objective Search Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel artificial intelligence approach to explore beyond Standard Model parameter spaces by leveraging a multi-objective optimisation algorithm. We apply this methodology to a non-minimal scotogenic model which is constrained by Higgs mass, anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, dark matter relic density, dark matter direct detection, neutrino masses and mixing, and lepton flavour violating processes. Our results successfully expand on the phenomenological realisations presented in previous work. We compare between multi- and single-objective algorithms and we observe more phenomenologically diverse solutions and an improved search capacity coming from the former. We use novelty detection to further explore sparsely populated regions of phenomenological interest. These results suggest a powerful search strategy that combines the global exploration of multi-objective optimisation with the exploitation of single-objective optimisation.</description>

      <title>The Migdal effect in solid crystals and the role of non-adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the Migdal effect in a solid crystal is entirely due to non-adiabatic effects, namely the deviation of the wave function from exact factorization of the electronic and nuclear contributions. The matrix element obtained this way matches exactly the result found by means of a previously derived low energy effective theory.</description>

      <title>A High-Quality Composite Pati-Salam Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a composite QCD axion model where the Peccei--Quinn (PQ) symmetry emerges as a high-quality, accidental symmetry. The axion potential is only modified by eight-fermion, dimension 12 operators, which if present at the Planck scale, allow for axion dark matter from misalignment while solving the strong CP problem. The model is an $\text{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theory with ten flavors where the Pati--Salam unified subgroup $\text{SO}(6)\times \text{SO}(4) \subset \text{SU}(10)_L$ and $\text{Sp}(10)\subset \text{SU}(10)_R$ are weakly gauged. The dynamics breaks $\text{SU}(10)_L\times \text{SU}(10)_R \rightarrow \text{SU}(10)_V$ and the weakly-gauged groups to $\text{U}(3)\times \text{U}(2) \supset \text{SU}(3)_c \times \text{SU}(2)_L \times \text{U}(1)_Y$, with the QCD axion identified as one of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. This axion has a relatively large coupling to photons while a residual $\bar{\theta}_{\rm eff}$ may be just below the current limit on the neutron electric dipole moment. If the dimension 12 operators are present near the GUT scale, they can cause domain wall networks to decay, allowing for axion dark matter even for the post-inflationary scenario.</description>

      <title>Full-Spectrum Analysis of Gravitational Wave Production from Inflation to Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study gravitational wave (GW) production during both the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. While inflationary GWs can be readily derived from tensor perturbations during inflation, post-inflationary GWs arise from a variety of processes during reheating and require detailed treatment for quantitative analysis. We consider four distinct production channels: $(i)$ pure inflaton annihilation, $(ii)$ graviton bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $(iii)$ radiation-catalyzed inflaton-graviton conversion, and $(iv)$ scattering among fully thermalized radiation particles. For each channel, we solve the corresponding Boltzmann equation to obtain the GW spectrum and derive a simple yet accurate analytical expression for it. By employing a consistent treatment of all production channels, our analysis yields for the first time the full spectrum of GWs produced during the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. We find that, while inflationary GWs dominate at low frequencies, post-inflationary processes generally produce high-frequency GWs with considerably high energy densities that may significantly exceed that of inflationary GWs.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Collider as a Discovery Tool for Invisible Dark Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate how the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) can be used to discover dark bosons with masses in the $\sim$ (10~MeV -- 10~GeV) regime, having a wide range of properties. We only require that the dark boson have a non-negligible weak coupling to electrons and decay with $\ord{1}$ branching fraction into invisible final states. Our signal selection takes advantage of the excellent electron beam kinematic measurements and the capability to tag incoherent scattering, as envisioned at the EIC. This makes the EIC a powerful tool for uncovering possible dark sector forces, for a broad range of possibilities.</description>

      <title>Effects of virtual Majorana neutrinos on charged Lepton Flavor Violation decays from a seesaw variant with radiatively induced light neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violating decays $\ell_{\alpha} \to \ell_{\beta} \gamma$, being forbidden in the Standard Model framework, provide a sensitive probe for new physics. We study these processes in a seesaw variant in which small neutrino masses are generated radiatively. By analyzing the parameter space constrained by electroweak precision data, we investigate the correlation between these decays and non-unitary effects from TeV-scale heavy neutrinos. According to our results, $\mu \to e \gamma$ is the most promising channel for new physics searches, with the bound $|\eta_{\mu e}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$ obtained for non-unitary effects in this radiative seesaw variant. Our estimations of $\mathcal{BR} \left( \mu \to e \gamma \right)$, which depends on the mass of the heavy neutrinos, shows that both current and future experimental facilities might be sensitive to these effects.</description>

      <title>Charmed Meson Structure across Crossover from SU(4) Polyakov Quark Meson Model with Isospin Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polyakov Quark Meson (PQM) model is extended to SU(4) flavor symmetry by incorporating the charm quark and introducing a finite isospin asymmetry. This model incorporates the light, strange, and charm chiral condensates, along with the Polyakov-loop variables, to describe the confinement--deconfinement phase transition in a thermal and dense QCD medium. The inclusion of the charm quark condensate enhances the capability of the SU(4) PQM model to explore the spatial and thermal resolution of the chiral phase structure, particularly in the crossover and high-temperature regimes. We construct the QCD phase diagram ($T/T_\chi-\mu_I/m_\pi$) plane, indicating a decrease in the pseudo-critical temperature as the isospin chemical potential increases and explore thermodynamic quantities related to the QCD equation of state at very high temperatures. Fluctuations of quark flavors, conserved charges and baryon-charm correlations are studied across a wide temperature range. The SU(4) PQM model exhibits good qualitative agreement with lattice QCD calculations. Additionally, we calculate the meson mass spectrum at zero and finite temperature, showing that the charm sector remains thermally stable over a wide temperature range. Overall, this study highlights the capability of the SU(4) PQM model to describe key features of QCD matter at high temperatures and its relevance to heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Cosmic Ray Spectrum with Next Generation Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of upcoming kiloton-scale neutrino detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, in determining the primary cosmic ray spectrum. These detectors provide full-sky coverage and long-term monitoring, unlike traditional satellite and balloon experiments that measure cosmic ray flux at specific altitudes and locations. By analyzing the atmospheric neutrino flux generated by cosmic ray interactions, we demonstrate that future detectors can differentiate between various cosmic ray models with high statistical significance, even when accounting for uncertainties in neutrino cross sections and hadronic interactions. We introduce a technique for reconstructing the primary cosmic ray spectrum using neutrino measurements, which reduces the flux uncertainty from approximately 20\% to about 7\%. We then show that Hyper-K has the potential to increase sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters, such as $\sin^2\theta_{23}$, by a factor of 2. Our results highlight the complementary role of neutrino detectors in cosmic ray physics and their critical importance for precision measurements in particle astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Fluence influenced by Memory Burdened Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), formed in the early Universe, are capable of emitting both Standard Model (SM) and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles via Hawking radiation. We investigate the impact of the recently proposed memory burden effect which is a quantum gravitational backreaction that suppresses black hole evaporation once approximately half the PBH mass is lost on the production of high energy neutrinos. In particular, we examine how this suppression modifies the time-integrated muon neutrino flux, with and without the inclusion of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) as BSM states. We compute the resulting neutrino fluence for different suppression strengths and analyze the prospects for detection in neutrino telescopes such as IceCube. Our results show that the memory burden significantly alters the neutrino energy spectrum, particularly at high energies, and that the presence of HNLs can counterbalance this suppression by introducing additional neutrino production channels. These findings have important implications for the detectability of PBH evaporation signatures and the parameter space of HNLs in cosmological settings.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of vacuum bubbles in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) during a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a dark sector has been of recent interest. A quantity that characterizes a black hole is its spin. We carry out the first step towards determining the spin of such PBHs, by calculating the spin of spherical false vacuum bubbles induced by cosmological perturbations. The angular momentum is given by the product of density and velocity perturbations. We carefully track the evolution of background quantities and calculate the transfer functions during the FOPT. We find that the dimensionless spin parameter $s = J/(G_{\rm N} M^2)$ of false vacuum bubbles of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, take a wide range of values from ${\cal{O}}(10^{-3})$ to ${\cal{O}}(10^3)$ for FOPTs between 10 keV and 100 GeV and a dark sector that is 0.1 to 0.4 times cooler than the visible sector. We also find a scaling relation between the root-mean-square value of the spin, the FOPT time scale, the bubble wall velocity, and the dark sector-to-visible sector temperature ratio.</description>

      <title>Valence quark distribution of light $\rho$ and heavy $J/\psi$ vector mesons in light-cone quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the valence quark structure of light $\rho$ and heavy $J/\psi$ vector mesons using the light-cone quark model through unpolarized quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By solving the quark-quark correlator, we have represented the quark GPDs in the form of light-front wave function (LFWFs). The charge, magnetic, and quadrupole form factors of these particles have been derived from the unpolarized quark GPDs and compared with the available theoretical predictions and lattice simulation data. The structure functions corresponding to the Rosenbluth scattering cross section of these mesons have also been calculated and compared with the available NJL model predictions. The results of our calculations are found to follow a similar trend as the other model results. We have also calculated the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of these particles in the forward limit of GPDs. The calculated PDFs have also been evolved to 5 GeV $^2$ through next to next leading order Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Theory and Its Generic Searches in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new formalism for quantum entanglement (QE), and study its generic searches at the colliders. For a general quantum system with $N$ particles, we show that the quantum space (the total spin polarization parameter space) is complex projective space, and the classical space (the spin polarization parameter space for classical theory) is the cartesian product of the complex projective spaces. Thus, the quantum entanglement space is the difference of these two spaces. For the $ff$, $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems, we propose their discriminants $\Delta_i$. The corresponding classical spaces are the discriminant locus $\Delta=0$ for $ff$ system, and intersections of the discriminant loci $\Delta_i=0$ for $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems in the quantum space. We show that our criterion $\Delta\not=0$ for quantum entanglement is equivalent to the original Peres-Horodecki criterion for $ff$ system. With the collider searches, we can reconstruct the discriminants from various measurements, and probe the quantum entanglement spaces via a fundamental approach at exact level. In addition, for the specific approach, we present a comprehensive framework to detect quantum entanglement in high-energy multi-particle systems, spanning fermion pairs (\(t\bar{t}\), \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)), bosonic pairs (\(W^{-}W^{+}\)), and hybrid or three-body systems (\(W^{-}t\), \(ttt\), \(t\bar{t}W^{-}\)). We derive diverse observables through angular correlations in decay products and establish key criteria for QE by calculating the exact quantum ranges and classical ranges, which can be used to detect QE at colliders. These results establish model-independent methodologies for probing QE across collider experiments, bridging quantum information principles with high-energy phenomenology, while offering novel pathways to explore exotic particles and quantum properties in multi-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $\kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF) $ D(t) $ obtained through a QCD analysis of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By comparing pressure profiles extracted from skewness-dependent GPDs with previous determinations based on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data, we establish updated bounds on $\kappa$. Our results show that the choice of proton pressure model significantly impacts the constraints, with the strongest limits ($|\kappa| \leq 0.10\text{--}0.3\, \text{m}^5\, \text{kg}^{-1}\, \text{s}^{-2}$). We further demonstrate that constraints obtained based on the first and second moments of the pressure distribution yield competitive bounds compared to those derived from peak pressures or those derived from just the first moment. These findings highlight the importance of precise experimental and theoretical determinations of the proton's mechanical properties in testing alternative theories of gravity. The present study motivates future improvements in GPD reconstructions for stronger constraints on EiBI gravity and related modifications.</description>

      <title>Flavour Non-Singlet Splitting Functions at Four Loops in QCD -- The Fermionic Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have determined the fourth-order $n_f$ contributions to the two splitting functions governing the evolution of all flavor differences of quark distributions of hadrons in perturbative quantum chromodynamics with $n_f$ light flavors. The analytic forms of these functions are presented in both Mellin $N$-space and momentum-fraction $x$-space for a general gauge group. In the small-$x$ limit double logarithms occur, but the small-$x$ rise of both splitting functions is confined to extremely small $x$-values, $x \lesssim 10^{-6}$. The large-$x$ limit includes the $n_f$-part of the four-loop quark virtual anomalous dimension. Using this result we obtain also the $n_f$ contributions to the corresponding gluonic quantity and the complete threshold-enhanced logarithms from soft-gluon emission for a large class of inclusive observables, including Higgs boson production in gluon-gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Pion in the Bethe-Salpeter approach with separable kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the static and dynamic properties of the pion in the Bethe-Salpeter approach are considered. The rank-one separable kernel of the quark-antiquark interaction is used to solve the equation analytically. Multidimensional integrals describing pion properties are calculated by several numerical methods and compared with previous papers. An error in the calculation of the interaction part of the elastic pion form factor is found. Using the corrected results, the kernel parameters are refitted. The calculated static properties as well as transition and elastic form factors are presented in comparison with the recent experimental data.</description>

Abstract: I share fond memories of my former PhD advisor Alexei Starobinsky with whom I was closely associated for nearly 45 years. I reflect upon my early years in Moscow when I worked with him on my thesis, and touch upon the seminal work on inflation which he did during that period. Alexei visited India often and actively interacted with Indian scientists and students on issues relating to inflation, large scale structure and dark energy. This extensive collaboration, which lasted several decades, resulted in the publication of over a dozen important papers, several PhD's, and the development of the Statefinder and Om diagnostics, which I briefly discuss.</description>

      <title>Black hole mimickers: from theory to observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole paradigm, while remarkably successful, raises fundamental questions-both classical and quantum-about the nature of spacetime, horizons, and singularities. Black hole mimickers, horizonless ultra-compact objects, have emerged as potential alternatives that seek to resolve some of these puzzles while remaining consistent with current observational constraints. Recent breakthroughs in gravitational-wave astronomy and horizon-scale electromagnetic imaging have opened new avenues to test this paradigm-making this an opportune moment to systematically investigate such alternatives.
  This vision document presents a snapshot of the field as discussed at the Black Hole Mimickers: From Theory to Observation workshop, where experts from gravitational wave astronomy, very long baseline interferometry, numerical and mathematical relativity, and high-energy physics converged to assess the current frontiers. By highlighting key open questions and proposing concrete pathways forward, this document aims to guide future efforts to probe the nature of compact objects. As the field stands at the crossroads of theoretical innovation and observational breakthroughs, we outline strategies to harness upcoming observational capabilities to fundamentally test the black hole paradigm.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This essay explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study propagators in bosonic field theories at finite temperature and chemical potential using the Schwinger-Keldysh real-time formalism. The system is considered in contact with a thermal reservoir, allowing for a consistent treatment of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations. The chemical potential, associated with conserved charges, modifies the structure of the propagators and introduces features that require detailed analysis.
  We focus on how a finite chemical potential affects the analytic structure of the bosonic propagators, including changes in the position of poles and the structure of branch cuts. In our setup, the chemical potential enters the theory as a constant background field, which alters both the dynamics and the boundary conditions. This work provides a basis for understanding the behavior of bosonic fields in thermal and dense environments.</description>

      <title>The Possibility of Formation of Compact Boson Stars via Cosmological Evolution of a Background Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boson stars, hypothetical astrophysical objects bound by the self-gravity of a scalar field, have been widely studied as a type of exotic compact object that is horizonless and provides a testing ground for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, many previous works have demonstrated methods for distinguishing compact boson stars from black holes in general relativity through gravitational wave observations. However, the formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a possible scenario for the formation of compact boson stars. The model we consider requires two coupled scalar fields: a complex scalar field that forms a boson star and a spatially homogeneous background field, as formation of a compact boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model. Using the adiabatic approximation, we show that non-relativistic boson clouds can evolve into compact boson stars through the cosmological time-evolution of the background field. In our model the background field evolves to increase the effective mass of the scalar field, and as a result compact boson stars can form within the cosmological timescale, if the variation of the background field is as large as the Planck scale. However, further investigation is required because the required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Dual Primordial Black Hole Formation Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a novel mechanism where two families of primordial black holes (PBHs) may form at nearly the same comoving scales but at two different epochs. It is realized in two-stage inflation where a non-inflationary stage is sandwiched by the two inflationary stages. In this case, smaller PBHs form when the comoving scale of interest re-enters the horizon during the break period, and larger PBHs form when the scale re-enters the horizon after inflation. This mechanism may realize both reheating of the universe through the evaporation of ultralight PBHs formed during the break stage and the dark matter by those formed after inflation. We show that this scenario may give rise to a distinctive signature in the stochastic gravitational wave background that can be tested by the near-future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA and DECIGO. Our work thus provides a unified observational window into the physics of inflation, reheating, and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Photonuclear Tomography in Ultraperipheral Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of photonuclear tomography as a novel technique for probing the internal structure of nuclei. In this approach, ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) serve as a source of intense fluxes of virtual photons, which induce coherent production of vector mesons. By analyzing the probabilities and cross sections of these photon-induced processes, we propose a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of nucleons within the nucleus. Our framework provides a systematic way to access information on the nuclear geometry probed in UPCs, offering new opportunities for studies of nuclear structure using particle production as a probe. Numerical calculations for selected examples illustrate the feasibility and potential of this method.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of bubble nucleation across a quantum phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The liquid-vapor transition is a classic example of a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition. Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators to probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble nucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with application to studies of matter formation in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations of charm and anticharm quarks at hadronisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collisions are a unique tool for studying properties of strong interactions at high energy densities. In particular, the momentum correlations of charm and bottom hadrons have been considered for testing heavy quark thermalisation in the dense matter produced by the collisions.
  In this respect, two effects have been considered: the decrease of the initial back-to-back correlations and the increase of correlations due to heavy-quark interactions with the collectively flowing medium.
  Here, we show that information on the spatial correlations of the charm-anticharm quarks at the hadronisation can be extracted by measuring the momentum correlation of charm and anticharm hadrons produced in central collisions of two heavy nuclei. This, however, requires collisions with a single charm-anticharm quark pair created - the condition likely to be fulfilled in central Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS energies. We introduce a method to correct the measured joint distribution function for the smearing of the charm and anticharm hadron momenta caused by hadronisation. Then the results are directly sensitive to the spatial correlations at the hadronisation. Using an example of central Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS energies, we demonstrate that even a limited statistics of charm-anticharm hadron pairs can distinguish between different spatial correlation functions of charm-anticharm quarks at hadronisation.
  The results on spatial charm-anticharm quark correlations will provide a unique test of different assumptions on heavy quark creation in space-time and transport in dense, strongly interacting matter. We show that the existing detector technology and beam intensities at the CERN SPS should allow us to conduct the needed experiments soon.</description>

Abstract: In collider physics, the properties of hadronic jets are often measured as a function of their lab-frame momenta. However, jet fragmentation must occur in a particular rest frame defined by all color-connected particles. Since this frame need not be the lab frame, the fragmentation of a jet depends on the properties of its sibling objects. This non-factorizability of jets has consequences for experimental jet techniques such as jet tagging, boosted boson measurements, and searches for physics Beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we will describe the effect and show its impact as predicted by simulation.</description>

Abstract: By introducing a Higgs-Dilaton potential, the 2T model has a trigger for a first order electroweak phase transition, namely for the mass of Dilaton between $300 $ GeV and $550$ GeV. We have also compared the transition strengths in the case with and without daisy loops, the difference being always less than $0.2$. The effective Higgs potential has given a sphaleron energy less than $8.4$ TeV. The timescale of phase transition $(\beta/H^*)$ is larger than $25$ and less than $34$ in all cases that are sufficient to trigger the first order electroweak phase transition. Gravitational wave energy density caused by this transition, may be detected by future detectors, could indirectly confirm Dilaton.</description>

      <title>Pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at next-to-leading order matched to Parton Shower</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at flavour factories plays a crucial role in the determination of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The recent CMD-3 measurement of the pion form factor via energy scan displays a significant difference with the previous experimental determinations. In order to contribute to an improved theoretical description and simulation of energy scan experiments, we present a calculation of the $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^- (\gamma)$ hadronic channel at next-to-leading order matched to a Parton Shower algorithm in QED and sQED. According to the recent advances in the literature, particular attention is paid to the treatment of the pion composite structure in loop diagrams beyond the commonly used factorised sQED approach, as well as to the modelling of multiple photon radiation through the Parton Shower algorithm. In particular, we carry out a detailed discussion on the inclusion of the pion form factor in the virtual sQED corrections according to two independent methods, inspired by the generalised vector meson dominance model and the dispersive approach, respectively. We find the two methods to be in remarkable agreement. We show phenomenological results for inclusive and differential observables which are relevant for precision energy scan measurements, focusing on the impact of the radiative corrections and the effect of the various approaches for the treatment of the pion form factor. Our calculation is implemented in an updated version of the Monte Carlo event generator BabaYaga@NLO, that can be used for fully exclusive simulations in data analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the extension of the classical non-standard cosmological model in which dissipative processes are considered through a bulk viscous term in the new field $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component during the early universe. Specifically, we consider an interaction term of the form $\Gamma_{\phi} \rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ represents the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ denotes its energy density and a bulk viscosity described by $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$, within the framework of Eckart's theory. This extended non-standard cosmology is employed to explore the parameter space for the production of Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs) as Dark Matter candidates, assuming a constant thermal averaged Dark Matter production cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$), as well as a preliminary analysis of the non-constant case. In particular, for certain combinations of the model and Dark Matter parameters, namely ($T_\text{end}$,$\kappa$) and $(m_\chi,\langle\sigma v\rangle)$, where $T_\text{end}$ corresponds to the temperature at which $\phi$ decays, $\kappa$ is the ratio between the initial energy density of $\phi$ and radiation, and $m_\chi$ is the Dark Matter mass, we identify extensive new parameter regions where Dark Matter can be successfully established while reproducing the currently observed relic density, in contrast to the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and classical non-standard cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>The pole inflation from broken non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the microscopic origin of the pole inflation from the scalar fields of broken non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity. We show that the $SO(1,N)$ isometry in the field space in combination with the Weyl symmetry relates the form of the non-minimal couplings to the one of the potential in the Jordan frame. In the presence of an explicit breaking of the $SO(1,N)$ symmetry in the coefficient of the potential, we realize the pole inflation near the pole of the inflaton kinetic term. Applying our results to the Higgs or PQ inflation models, we find that there is one parameter family of the solutions for the pole inflation, depending on the overall coefficient of the Weyl covariant derivatives for scalar fields. The same coefficient not only makes the predictions of the pole inflation varying, being compatible with the Planck data, but also determines the mass of the Weyl gauge field. We also show that the isocurvature perturbations of the axion can be suppressed sufficiently during the PQ pole inflation, and the massive Weyl gauge field produced during reheating serves as a dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <title>Viscous effects of a hot QGP medium in time dependent magnetic field and their phenomenological significance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied, for the first time, the impact of a realistic picture of a time dependent electric and magnetic field on the shear and bulk viscosities of the medium. Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time or equivalently, decrease with the strength of the magnetic field. To connect these observations with experiments, we have calculated the thermalization time, shear viscosity to entropy ratio ($\eta /s$), and bulk viscosity to entropy ratio ($\zeta /s$).</description>

      <title>Weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

      <title>Studying the $K\Lambda$ strong interaction with femtoscopic correlation functions and the $N^*(1535)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $K \Lambda$ strong interaction dynamics around the energy region of $N^*(1535)$ resonance through femtoscopic correlation functions within the Koonin-Pratt formalism, where coupled-channel effects of $\pi N$, $K\Lambda$, $K \Sigma$ and $\eta N$ channels are taken into account, by means of which the $N^*(1535)$ resonance can be dynamically generated in the chiral unitary approach. Two-body scattering amplitudes are calculated using the chiral unitary approach, and the corresponding wave functions and correlation functions are obtained. Our analysis shows that the $\pi N$ channel becomes important to the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function through coupled channel effects, even if its mass threshold is far from the energy region of the $N^*(1535)$. Furthermore, with the picture that the $N^*(1535)$ is a dynamically generated state, we can get a good reproduction of the experimental data on the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function. This work establishes femtoscopic correlation functions as a sensitive probe for coupled-channel dynamics and validates the Koonin-Pratt framework in multi-channel hadronic systems, offering critical insights into some exotic hadron states and strong interaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The impact of the TMD shape function on matching the transverse momentum spectrum in $J/\psi$ production at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of the inclusion of TMD shape functions on the transverse momentum spectrum in $J/\psi$ production at the EIC is investigated by considering the matching of the TMD factorization description at low transverse momentum with the collinear factorization description at high transverse momentum by means of the inverse-error weighting method. Despite large uncertainties from scale variations and the $J/\psi$ long-distance matrix elements, predictions for the differential cross section and its $\cos(2\phi_\psi)$ modulation are obtained. We find that physical constraints are satisfied in case a process-dependent term is included for color octet production, but not in all cases when it is excluded. These numerical results support the analytic calculations in \cite{Boer:2023zit}. Future experimental data can thus test the validity of TMD factorization in $J/\psi$ production and explore the presence of nontrivial process-dependent effects in the soft-gluon resummation. This will be crucial in the extraction of gluon unpolarized and linearly polarized TMD distributions of the proton. In addition, we suggest how the sign of the latter can be determined by investigating the presence of a node in the $\cos(2\phi_\psi)$ modulation as a function of transverse momentum.</description>

Abstract: We consider the addition to the Standard Model of a scalar $SU(2)$ multiplet $\Delta_n$ with dimension $n$ going from $1$ to $6$. The multiplet $\Delta_n$ is assumed to have null vacuum expectation value and an arbitrary (free) hypercharge. We determine the shape of the phase space for the new terms that appear in the scalar potential (SP); we observe in particular that, in the case of a 6-plet, the phase space is slightly concave along one of its boundaries. We determine the bounded-from-below and vacuum stability conditions on the SP for each value of $n$.</description>

Abstract: The Square Kilometer Array will initiate a new era of radio astronomy by allowing 3D imaging of the Universe during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization. Modern machine learning is crucial to analyse the highly structured and complex signal. However, accurate training data is expensive to simulate, and supervised learning may not generalize. We introduce a self-supervised vision transformer, SKATR, whose learned encoding can be cheaply adapted for downstream tasks on 21cm maps. Focusing on regression and generative inference of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that SKATR representations are maximally informative and that SKATR generalises out-of-domain to differently-simulated, noised, and higher-resolution datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{\cal R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 229Th nucleus possesses a unique low-frequency transition at 8.4 eV, which is being considered for the development of an extremely accurate nuclear clock. We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where nuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper choice of laser frequencies can lead to 10,000 enhancement of this effect. Electrons also reduce 1.7 times the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.
  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features that make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains a metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition, which can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches for oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the Einstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole moment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level crossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing renders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation of the fine-structure constant.</description>

Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter models: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD) is one of the three experiments of the Nuclotron Ion Collider-fAcility (NICA) complex, which is currently under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. With collisions of heavy ions in the collider mode, the MPD will cover the energy range 4-11 GeV to scan the high baryon-density region of the QCD phase diagram. With expected statistics of 50-100 million events collected during the first run, MPD will be able to study a number of observables, including measurements of light hadrons and hypernuclei production, particle flow, correlations and fluctuations, have a first look at dielectron production, and modification of vector-meson properties in dense matter. In this paper, we present selected results of the physics feasibility studies for the MPD experiment in Bismuth-Bismuth collisions at an energy of 9.2 GeV, the system considered as one of the first available at the NICA collider.</description>
