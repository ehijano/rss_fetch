      <title>Smoothness of linearization by mixing parameters of dichotomy, bounded growth and perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the smoothness properties of a global and nonautonomous topological conjugacy between a linear system and a quasilinear perturbation. The linear system exhibits a nonuniform exponential dichotomy with a nontrivial projector and nonuniform bounded growth property. Additionally, the quasilinear perturbation is dominated by an increasing exponential function. Emphasis is placed on employing a set of parameters to describe the conditions of dichotomy, bounded growth and quasilinear perturbations. Finally, we prove that modifying these conditions enables us to achieve a broader smoothness interval.</description>

      <title>Idempotent approach to level-2 variational principles in Thermodynamical Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an idempotent pressure to level-2 functions and its associated density entropy. All this is related to idempotent pressure functions which is the natural concept that corresponds to the meaning of probability in the level-2 max-plus context. In this general framework the equilibrium states, maximizing the variational principle, are not unique. We investigate the connections with the general convex pressure introduced recently to level-1 functions by Bi\'{s}, Carvalho, Mendes and Varandas. Our general setting contemplates the dynamical and not dynamical framework. We also study a characterization of the density entropy in order to get an idempotent pressure invariant by dynamical systems acting on probabilities; this is therefore a level-2 result. We are able to produce idempotent pressure functions at level-2 which are invariant by the dynamics of the pushforward map via a form of Ruelle operator.</description>

      <title>Method of Lie Symmetry for analytical solutions, periodicity and attractivity of a family of tenth-order difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for finding analytical solutions to differential equations, both partial and ordinary, via the similarity variables or via the invariance of the equation under group transformations. It is the largest group of transformations that leaves the differential equation invariant. It is now known that this differential equation method plays the same role when it comes to the study of difference equations. Difference equations can be used to model various phenomena where the changes occur in discrete manner. The use of symmetries on recurrence equations, usually, leads to reductions of order and hence ease the process of finding their solutions. One of the aims of this work is to employ symmetries to generalize some results in the literature. We present new generalized formula solutions of a class of difference equations and we investigate the periodicity and behavior of theses solutions.</description>

      <title>Counting Problem for Some Random Conformal Iterated Function Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the counting problem in random dynamical systems. We noticed that the nature of counting in the random setting is completely different than that of the deterministic systems in the sense that non-exponential growth is constructed on a set of full measure. The recurrent behavior of random walks plays a major role in counting in the random setting.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic non-integrability of a Hamiltonian system with a sixth-order homogeneous potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hamiltonian system with Hamiltonian \\ $H=\frac{1}{2}(p_r^2+p_z^2)+V_6(r,z)$, where $V_6(r,z)=r^6+Ar^2z^4+Dr^3z^3+Br^4z^2+Cz^6$, ($A,\, B,\, C,\, D \in \mathbb{R}$) for meromorphic integrability. The technique is an application of the Ziglin-Moralez-Ruiz-Ramis-Simo Theory. The difficulty that arises in solving this problem is related to the complex multivalued of the partial solution used. This difficulty is overcome by a little trick from algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Three-to-one internal resonances in coupled harmonic oscillators with cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a general system of two coupled harmonic oscillators with cubic nonlinearity. Without damping, the system is Hamiltonian, with the origin as an elliptic equilibrium characterized by two distinct linear frequencies. To understand the dynamics, it is crucial to derive explicit analytic formulae for the nonlinear frequencies as functions of the physical parameters involved. In the small amplitude regime (perturbative case), we provide the first-order nonlinear correction to the linear frequencies. While this analytic expression was already derived for non-resonant cases, it is novel in the context of resonant or nearly resonant scenarios. Specifically, we focus on the 3:1 resonance, the only resonance involved in the first-order correction. Utilizing the Hamiltonian structure, we employ Perturbation Theory methods to transform the system into Birkhoff Normal Form up to order four. This involves converting the system into action-angle variables (symplectically rescaled polar coordinates), where the truncated Hamiltonian at order four depends on the actions and, due to the resonance, on one "slow" angle. By constructing suitable nonlinear and not close-to-the-identity coordinate transformations, we identify new sets of symplectic action-angle variables. In these variables, the resulting system is integrable up to higher-order terms, meaning it does not depend on the angles, and the frequencies are obtained from the derivatives of the energy with respect to the actions. This construction is highly dependent on the physical parameters, necessitating a detailed case analysis of the phase portrait, revealing up to six topologically distinct behaviors. As an application, we examine wave propagation in metamaterial honeycombs with periodically distributed nonlinear resonators, evaluating the nonlinear effects on the bandgap particularly in the presence of resonances.</description>

      <title>Extravagance, irrationality and Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotent function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``Renyi measure'' for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotent function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are via the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type theorem for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures''.</description>

      <title>A many-loci system with evolution characterized by uncountable linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolution of a multi-locus biological system. The evolution of such a system is described by a quadratic stochastic operator (QSO) defined on a simplex. We demonstrate that this QSO can be decomposed into an infinite series of linear operators, each of which maps certain invariant subsets of the simplex to themselves. Furthermore, the entire simplex is the union of these invariant subsets, enabling analytical examination of the dynamical systems produced by the QSO. Finding all limit points of the dynamical system generated by the QSO in terms of the limit points of the linear operators, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the many-loci population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Approximation of Linear Systems with Polynomial Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllability and observability energy functions play a fundamental role in model order reduction and are inherently connected to optimal control problems. For linear dynamical systems the energy functions are known to be quadratic polynomials and various low-rank approximation techniques allow for computing them in a large-scale setting. For nonlinear problems computing the energy functions is significantly more challenging. In this paper, we investigate a special class of nonlinear systems that have a linear state and a polynomial output equation. We show that the energy functions of these systems are again polynomials and investigate under which conditions they can effectively be approximated using low-rank tensors. Further, we introduce a new perspective on the well-established balanced truncation method for linear systems which then readily generalizes to the nonlinear systems under consideration. This new perspective yields a novel energy-based model order reduction procedure that accurately captures the input-output behavior of linear systems with polynomial outputs via a low-dimensional reduced order model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via two numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of the $\alpha$-Wilton functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study the regularity properties of the Wilton functions $W_\alpha$ associated with $\alpha$-continued fractions. We prove that the Wilton function is BMO for $\alpha\in[1-g,g]$ (where $g:=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$ denotes the golden number), and we show that this result is optimal, since we find that on any left neighbourhood of $1-g$ and on any right neighbourhood of $g$ there are values $\alpha$ for which $W_\alpha$ is not BMO; the proof of this latter negative results exploits a special feature of the family of $\alpha$-continued fractions called ``matching''. Our results complete those of Marmi--Moussa--Yoccoz (1997) and of Lee--Marmi--Petrykiewicz--Schindler (2024), where it is proven that Wilton function is BMO for, respectively, $\alpha=1/2$ (\cite{MaMoYo_97}) and $\alpha \in[\frac{1}{2},g]$ (\cite{LeMar_24}).</description>

      <title>Validated enclosure of renormalization fixed points via Chebyshev series and the DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a computational framework for proving existence, uniqueness, isolation, and stability results for real analytic fixed points of $m$-th order Feigenbaum-Cvitanovi\'{c} renormalization operators. Our approach builds on the earlier work of Lanford, Eckman, Wittwer, Koch, Burbanks, Osbaldestin, and Thurlby \cite{iii1982computer,eckmann1987complete,MR0727816, burbanks2021rigorous2,burbanks2021rigorous1}, however the main point of departure between ours and previous studies is that we discretize the domain of the renormalization operators using Chebyshev rather than Taylor series. The advantage of Chebyshev series is that they are naturally adapted to spaces of real analytic functions, in the sense that they converge on ellipses containing real intervals rather than on disks in $\mathbb{C}$. The main disadvantage of working with Chebyshev series in this context is that the essential operations of rescaling and composition are less straight forward for Chebysehv than for Taylor series. These difficulties are overcome using a combination of a-priori information about decay rates in the Banach space with a-posteriori estimates on Chebyshev interpolation errors for analytic functions.
  Our arguments are implemented in the Julia programming language and exploit extended precision floating point interval arithmetic. In addition to proving the existence of multiple renormalization fixed points of order $m = 3, \ldots, 10$, and computing validated bounds on the values of their the universal constants, we also reprove the existence of the classical $m=2$ Feigenbaum renormalization fixed point and compute its universal constants to close to 500 correct decimal digits.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Echo State Networks for Modeling Controllable Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are recurrent neural networks usually employed for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems with relatively ease of training. By incorporating physical laws into the training of ESNs, Physics-Informed ESNs (PI-ESNs) were proposed initially to model chaotic dynamic systems without external inputs. They require less data for training since Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) of the considered system help to regularize the ESN. In this work, the PI-ESN is extended with external inputs to model controllable nonlinear dynamic systems. Additionally, an existing self-adaptive balancing loss method is employed to balance the contributions of the residual regression term and the physics-informed loss term in the total loss function. The experiments with two nonlinear systems modeled by ODEs, the Van der Pol oscillator and the four-tank system, and with one differential-algebraic (DAE) system, an electric submersible pump, revealed that the proposed PI-ESN outperforms the conventional ESN, especially in scenarios with limited data availability, showing that PI-ESNs can regularize an ESN model with external inputs previously trained on just a few datapoints, reducing its overfitting and improving its generalization error (up to 92% relative reduction in the test error). Further experiments demonstrated that the proposed PI-ESN is robust to parametric uncertainties in the ODE equations and that model predictive control using PI-ESN outperforms the one using plain ESN, particularly when training data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic limits of transient patterns in a continuous-space interacting particle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time interacting particle system with continuous state space which is motivated by a mathematical model for turnover through branching in actin filament networks. It gives rise to transient clusters reminiscent of actin filament assemblies in the cortex of living cells. We reformulate the process in terms of the inter-particle distances and characterise their marginal and joint distributions. We construct a recurrence relation for the associated characteristic functions and pass to the large population limit, reminiscent of the Fleming-Viot super-processes. The precise characterisation of all marginal distributions established in this work opens the way to a detailed analysis of cluster dynamics. We also obtain a recurrence relation which enables us to compute the moments of the asymptotic single particle distribution characterising the transient aggregates. Our results indicate that aggregates have a fat-tailed distribution.</description>

Abstract: Optimizing problems in a distributed manner is critical for systems involving multiple agents with private data. Despite substantial interest, a unified method for analyzing the convergence rates of distributed optimization algorithms is lacking. This paper introduces an energy conservation approach for analyzing continuous-time dynamical systems in dilated coordinates. Instead of directly analyzing dynamics in the original coordinate system, we establish a conserved quantity, akin to physical energy, in the dilated coordinate system. Consequently, convergence rates can be explicitly expressed in terms of the inverse time-dilation factor. Leveraging this generalized approach, we formulate a novel second-order distributed accelerated gradient flow with a convergence rate of $O\left(1/t^{2-\epsilon}\right)$ in time $t$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$. We then employ a semi second-order symplectic Euler discretization to derive a rate-matching algorithm with a convergence rate of $O\left(1/k^{2-\epsilon}\right)$ in $k$ iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the most favorable convergence rate for any distributed optimization algorithm designed for smooth convex optimization. Its accelerated convergence behavior is benchmarked against various state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms on practical, large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Solitaire of Independence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a reversible process (more precisely, a groupoid/group action) resembling the classical 15-puzzle, where the legal moves are to ``move the unique hole inside a translate of a shape $S$''. Such a process can be defined for any finite subset $S$ of a group, and we refer to such a process as simply ``solitaire''. We develop a general theory of solitaire, and then concentrate on the simplest possible example, solitaire for the plane $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and $S$ the triangle shape (equivalently, any three-element set in general position). In this case, we give a polynomial time algorithm that puts any finite subset of the plane in normal form using solitaire moves, and show that the solitaire orbit of a line of consecutive ones -- the line orbit -- is completely characterised by the notion of a so-called fill matrix. We show that the diameter of the line orbit, as a graph with edges the solitaire moves, is cubic. We show that analogous results hold for the square shape, but indicate some shapes (still on the group $\mathbb{Z}^2$) where this is less immediate. We then explain in detail the connection of the solitaire to TEP and more generally permutive subshifts. Namely, the solitaire is a closure property of various sets of subsets of the group that can be associated to such a subshift, such as the independence, spanning and filling sets.</description>

      <title>Latent Symmetry of Graphs and Stretch Factors in Out(Fr)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every irreducible outer automorphism of the free group of rank r is topologically represented by an irreducible train track map $f$ on some graph $\Gamma$ of rank r. Moreover, $f$ can always be written as a composition of folds and a graph isomorphism. We give a lower bound on the stretch factor of an irreducible outer automorphism in terms of the number of folds of $f$ and the number of edges in $\Gamma$. In the case that $f$ is periodic on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, we show a precise notion of the latent symmetry of $\Gamma$ gives a lower bound on the number of folds required. We use this notion of latent symmetry to classify all possible irreducible single fold train track maps.</description>

Abstract: For quasicrystals of cut-and-project type in $\mathbb{R}^d$, it was proved by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson that the limit local statistical properties of the directions to the points in the set are described by certain $\operatorname{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$-invariant point processes. In the present paper we make a detailed study of the tail asymptotics of the limiting gap statistics of the directions, for certain specific classes of planar quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary approach for discovering non-Gaussian stochastic dynamical systems based on nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering explicit governing equations of stochastic dynamical systems with both (Gaussian) Brownian noise and (non-Gaussian) L\'evy noise from data is chanllenging due to possible intricate functional forms and the inherent complexity of L\'evy motion. This present research endeavors to develop an evolutionary symbol sparse regression (ESSR) approach to extract non-Gaussian stochastic dynamical systems from sample path data, based on nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas, genetic programming, and sparse regression. More specifically, the genetic programming is employed to generate a diverse array of candidate functions, the sparse regression technique aims at learning the coefficients associated with these candidates, and the nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas serve as the foundation for constructing the fitness measure in genetic programming and the loss function in sparse regression. The efficacy and capabilities of this approach are showcased through its application to several illustrative models. This approach stands out as a potent instrument for deciphering non-Gaussian stochastic dynamics from available datasets, indicating a wide range of applications across different fields.</description>

      <title>Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}&lt;p&lt;1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>On System Operators with Variation Bounding Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The property of linear discrete-time time-invariant system operators mapping inputs with at most $k-1$ sign changes to outputs with at $k-1$ sign changes is investigated. We show that this property is tractable via the notion of $k$-sign consistency in case of the observability/controllability operator, which as such can also be used as a sufficient condition for the Hankel operator. Our results complement the literature in several aspects: an algebraic characterization, independent of rank and dimension, is provided for variation bounding and diminishing matrices and their computational tractability is discussed. Based on these, we conduct our studies of variation bounding system operators beyond existing studies on order-preserving $k$-variation diminishment. Our results are applied to the open problem of bounding the number of sign changes in a system's impulse response.</description>

      <title>A quantitative model for the Frank-Read dislocation source based on pinned mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a quantitative model for the Frank-Read source, considered to be one of the most important micro-mechanical mechanisms of dislocation creation in crystalline materials. It has long been known that these sources create dislocations in a repetitive, oscillatory process, which is driven by an external shear force. Unlike the existing explanations in the literature, the model introduced in the present article is based on just a few simple physical principles, namely line tension and dislocation motion due to a single slip plane flow rule, together with a pinning constraint on the ends of the central dislocation line. A complete discretisation, including suitable re-meshing and 'topological cutting' algorithms, is described and simulation results are discussed. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the model and discretisation described in the present work yield remarkably accurate predictions about the shape and properties of the Frank-Read source. In particular, it is shown that only one dimensionless parameter controls the dynamics of the Frank-Read source if one neglects crystal anisotropy. This allows to derive an emergent law about the length of dislocation line generated per shear energy.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, Ra ~ 31.8 Ta^(1/2) - 4.43 Ta^(5/12) for no-slip boundaries. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented surface, and two Anosov magnetic systems on $M$ are conjugate by a volume-preserving conjugacy isotopic to the identity, with their magnetic forms in the same cohomology class, then the metrics are isometric.

Abstract: We study the periodic solutions of the delay equation $\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t),x(t-1))$, where $f$ scalar is strictly monotone in the delayed component and has even-odd symmetry. We completely describe the global bifurcation structure of periodic solutions via a period map originating from planar ordinary differential equations. Moreover, we prove that the first derivative of the period map determines the local stability of the periodic orbits. This article builds on the pioneering work of Kaplan and Yorke, who found some symmetric periodic solutions for $f$ with even-odd symmetry. We enhance their results by proving that all periodic solutions are symmetric if $f$ is in addition monotone.</description>

Abstract: Let f(z)=z^2+c be an infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomial and J_\infty be the intersection of forward orbits of "small" Julia sets of its simple renormalizations. We prove that if f admits an infinite sequence of satellite renormalizations, then every invariant measure of f: J_\infty\to J_\infty is supported on the postcritical set and has zero Lyapunov exponent. Coupled with [G. Levin, F. Przytycki, W. Shen, The Lyapunov exponent of holomorphic maps. Invent. Math. 205 (2016), 363-382], this implies that the Lyapunov exponent of such f at c is equal to zero, which answers partly a question posed by Weixiao Shen.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cyclicity of Monodromic Tangential Singularities: Insights Beyond the Pseudo-Hopf Bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cyclicity problem, crucial in analyzing planar vector fields, consists in estimating the number of limit cycles emanating from monodromic singularities. Traditionally, this estimation relies on Lyapunov coefficients. However, in nonsmooth systems, besides the limit cycles bifurcating by varying the Lyapunov coefficients, monodromic singularities on the switching curve can always be split apart yielding, under suitable conditions, a sliding region and an additional limit cycle surrounding it. This bifurcation phenomenon, known as pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, has enhanced lower-bound cyclicity estimations for monodromic singularities in Filippov systems. In this study, we push beyond the pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, demonstrating that the destruction of $(2k,2k)$-monodromic tangential singularities yields at least $k$ limit cycles surrounding sliding segments. This new bifurcation phenomenon expands our understanding of limit cycle bifurcations in nonsmooth systems and, in addition to the theoretical significance, has practical relevance in various applied models involving switches and abrupt processes.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional maps with discontinuities are considered. It is shown that, in the presence of discontinuities, the essential spectrum of the transfer operator is large whenever it acts on a Banach space with norm that is stronger than \(L^\infty\) or \(BV\). Three classes of examples are introduced and studied, both expanding and partially expanding. In two dimensions there is complication due to the geometry of the discontinuities, an issue not present in the one-dimensional case and which is explored in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of periodic perturbations of an attracting robust heteroclinic cycle defined on the two-sphere is studied by reducing the analysis to that of a one-parameter family of maps on a circle. The set of zeros of the family forms a bifurcation diagram on the cylinder. The different bifurcation diagrams and the transitions between them are obtained as the strength of attraction of the cycle and the amplitude of the periodic perturbation vary. We determine a threshold in the cycle's attraction strength above which frequency locked periodic solutions with arbitrarily long periods bifurcate from the cycle as the period of the perturbation decreases. Below this threshold further transitions are found giving rise to a frequency locked invariant torus and to a frequency locked suspended horseshoe, arising from heteroclinic tangencies in the family of maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a sub-riemannian structure on the torus, satisfying the H\"ormander condition, we consider the Ma\~n\'e Lagrangian associated to a horizontal vector field. Assuming that the Aubry set consists in a finite number of static classes, we show that the invariant measure, for the horizontal stochastic perturbation of the flow of the vector field, determines a particular weak KAM solution of the Lagrangian, as the perturbation tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Mean value theorems in multiplicative systems and joint ergodicity of additive and multiplicative actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the study of additive ergodic averages in multiplicative systems and the investigation of the "pretentious" dynamical behaviour of these systems. We prove a mean ergodic theorem (Theorem A) that generalises Hal\'asz's mean value theorem for finitely generated multiplicative functions taking values in the unit circle. In addition, we obtain two structural results concerning the "pretentious" dynamical behaviour of finitely generated multiplicative systems. Moreover, motivated by the independence principle between additive and multiplicative structures of the integers, we explore the joint ergodicity (as a natural notion of independence) of an additive and a finitely generated multiplicative action, both acting on the same probability space. In Theorem B, we show that such actions are jointly ergodic whenever no "local obstructions" arise, and we give a concrete description of these "local obstructions". As an application, we obtain some new combinatorial results regarding arithmetic configurations in large sets of integers including refinements of a special case of Szemer\'edi's theorem.</description>

      <title>Angular spectra of linear dynamical systems in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the notion of an angular spectrum for a linear discrete time nonautonomous dynamical system. The angular spectrum comprises all accumulation points of longtime averages formed by maximal principal angles between successive subspaces generated by the dynamical system. The angular spectrum is bounded by angular values which have previously been investigated by the authors. In this contribution we derive explicit formulas for the angular spectrum of some autonomous and specific nonautonomous systems. Based on a reduction principle we set up a numerical method for the general case; we investigate its convergence and apply the method to systems with a homoclinic orbit and a strange attractor. Our main theoretical result is a theorem on the invariance of the angular spectrum under summable perturbations of the given matrices (roughness theorem). It applies to systems with a so-called complete exponential dichotomy (CED), a concept which we introduce in this paper and which imposes more stringent conditions than those underlying the exponential dichotomy spectrum.</description>

      <title>The role of spatial dimension in the emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability has been well studied in two and three dimensional settings and predicted for higher spatial dimensions. We prove the existence of localised $(n+1)$-dimensional radial patterns in general two-component reaction-diffusion systems near a Turing instability, where $n&gt;0$ is taken to be a continuous parameter. We determine explicit dependence of each pattern's radial profile on the dimension $n$ through the introduction of $(n+1)$-dimensional Bessel functions, revealing a deep connection between the formation of localised radial patterns in different spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Turbulent homeomorphisms and the topological snail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological snail is a geometric universal plane object, described by matrices in the projective special linear group with integer coefficients. It has many nice properties : in the case of three points, it natually defines a representation of the mapping-class group. From a dynamical point of view, it gives a description of the set of fixed points and periodic obits of turbulent homeomorphims in the plane. Those homeomorphisms are the truly complicated one. They have many fixed points and periodic orbits, as much as the trace of the turbulence matrix that caracterizes their action on a finite invariant set. The topological snail generally gives a map of the fixed points and periodic orbits of a such homeomorphims. One can compute their indexes and turbulent topological types, and different Nielsen's classes of fixed points naturally give a minoration of the topological entropy of the considered homeomorphisms by the logarithm of the spectral radius of the turbulence matrix. One even get a dynamical interpretation and proof of the extension of the Fermat' theorem to matrices. I first described the topological snail and its properties at my conference the 31st of may 2024 in Paris, in the case of a purely turbulent homeomorphism, with an invariant set of three points.</description>

      <title>Dual Representations and $H_{\infty}$-Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $H_{\infty}$-optimal state-feedback control of the class of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) class, which admit a Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. While linear matrix inequalities are commonly used for optimal control of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), the absence of a universal state-space representation and suitable dual form prevents such methods from being applied to optimal control of PDEs. Specifically, for ODEs, the controller synthesis problem is defined in state-space, and duality is used to resolve the bilinearity of that synthesis problem. Recently, the PIE representation was proposed as a universal state-space representation for linear PDE systems. In this paper, we show that any PDE system represented by a PIE admits a dual PIE with identical stability and I/O properties. This result allows us to reformulate the stabilizing and optimal state-feedback control problems as convex optimization over the cone of positive Partial Integral (PI) operators. Operator inversion formulae then allow us to construct feedback gains for the original PDE system. The results are verified through application to several canonical problems in optimal control of PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed surface and let $\{g_s \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ be a smooth one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics on $M$. Also let $\{\kappa_s : M \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ be a smooth one-parameter family of functions on $M$. Then the family $\{(g_s, \kappa_s) \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ gives rise to a family of magnetic flows on $TM$. We show that if the magnetic curvatures are negative for $s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ and the lengths of each periodic orbit remains constant as the parameter $s$ varies, then there exists a smooth family of diffeomorphisms $\{f_s : M \rightarrow M \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ such that $f_s^*(g_s) = g_0$ and $f_s^*(\kappa_s) = \kappa_0$. This generalizes a result of Guillemin and Kazhdan to the setting of magnetic flows.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Opinion Dynamics under Social Pressure in Arbitrary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social pressure is a key factor affecting the evolution of opinions on networks in many types of settings, pushing people to conform to their neighbors' opinions. To study this, the interacting Polya urn model was introduced by Jadbabaie et al., in which each agent has two kinds of opinion: inherent beliefs, which are hidden from the other agents and fixed; and declared opinions, which are randomly sampled at each step from a distribution which depends on the agent's inherent belief and her neighbors' past declared opinions (the social pressure component), and which is then communicated to her neighbors. Each agent also has a bias parameter denoting her level of resistance to social pressure. At every step, each agent updates her declared opinion (simultaneously with all other agents) according to her neighbors' aggregate past declared opinions, her inherent belief, and her bias parameter. We study the asymptotic behavior of this opinion dynamics model and show that the agents' declaration probabilities approaches a set of equilibrium points of the expected dynamics using Lyapunov theory and stochastic approximation techniques. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the agents to approach consensus on their declared opinions. Our work provides further insight into the difficulty of inferring the inherent beliefs of agents when they are under social pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the class of groups of bounded type from tile inflations. These tile inflations also determine some automata describing the groups. In the case when the automata are stationary and finite-state, we show that if the set of incompressible elements of a group in this class is finite, then this group has subexponential growth with a bounded power in the exponent. Then we describe some examples with certain special structures of orbital graphs and give explicit ways to find the upper bounds for the growth functions of these groups.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs of existence and stability of solitary waves in the Whitham and capillary-gravity Whitham equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in both the Whitham and the capillary-gravity Whitham equations. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of stable {solitary waves} in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). Moreover, we provide an existence proof for a branch of solitary waves in the case $T=0$ via a rigorous continuation in the wave velocity. The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds in non-autonomous quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on outside probabilities for generic non-autonomous Schr\"odinger operators on lattices of arbitrary dimension. Our approach is based on a combination of commutator method originated in scattering theory and novel monotonicity estimate for certain mollified asymptotic observables that track the spacetime localization of evolving states. Sub-ballistic upper bounds are obtained, assuming that momentum vanishes sufficiently fast in the front of the wavepackets. A special case gives a refinement of the general ballistic upper bound of Radin-Simon's, showing that the evolution of wavepackets are effectively confined to a strictly linear light cone with explicitly bounded slope. All results apply to long-range Hamiltonian with polynomial decaying off-diagonal terms and can be extended, via a frozen-coefficient argument, to generic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on lattices.</description>
