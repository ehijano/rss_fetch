      <title>Trust Dynamics and Market Behavior in Cryptocurrency: A Comparative Study of Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of digital finance, the transition from centralized to decentralized trust mechanisms, primarily driven by blockchain technology, plays a critical role in shaping the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This paradigm shift raises questions about the traditional reliance on centralized trust and introduces a novel, decentralized trust framework built upon distributed networks. Our research delves into the consequences of this shift, particularly focusing on how incidents influence trust within cryptocurrency markets, thereby affecting trade behaviors in centralized (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). We conduct a comprehensive analysis of various events, assessing their effects on market dynamics, including token valuation and trading volumes in both CEXs and DEXs. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of trust in directing user preferences and the fluidity of trust transfer between centralized and decentralized platforms. Despite certain anomalies, the results largely align with our initial hypotheses, revealing the intricate nature of user trust in cryptocurrency markets. This study contributes significantly to interdisciplinary research, bridging distributed systems, behavioral finance, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It offers valuable insights for the distributed computing community, particularly in understanding and applying distributed trust mechanisms in digital economies, paving the way for future research that could further explore the socio-economic dimensions and leverage blockchain data in this dynamic domain.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Public Debt Cycles: Don't Ignore the Impact of Financial Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the quarterly data from 26 advanced economies (AEs) and 18 emerging market economies (EMs) over the past two decades, this paper estimates the short- and medium-term impacts of financial cycles on the duration and amplitude of public debt cycles. The results indicate that public debt expansions are larger than their contractions in duration and amplitude, aligning with the "deficit bias hypothesis" and being more pronounced in EMs than in AEs. The impacts of various financial cycles are different. Specifically, credit cycles in EMs significantly impact the duration and amplitude of public debt cycles. Notably, short- and medium-term credit booms in EMs shorten the duration of public debt contractions and reduce the amplitude. Fast credit growth in AEs prolongs the duration of public debt expansions and increases the amplitude. However, credit cycles in AEs show no significant impact. For house price cycles, the overall impact is stronger in EMs than in AEs, differing between short- and medium-term cycles. Finally, the impact of equity price cycles is significant in the short term, but not in the medium term. Equity price busts are more likely to prolong the expansion of public debt in EMs while increasing the amplitude of public debt contractions in AEs. Uncovering the impacts of multiple financial cycles on public debt cycles provides implications for better debt policies under different financial conditions.</description>

      <title>The Role of Marketing in Public Policy Decision Making: The Case of Fuel Subsidy Removal in Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public policy decision making has become more complex and complicated in recent times. Some authors have attributed this to the fact that public policy decision makers now have more variables to consider in every decision more than ever before. Others have argued that the rate of civilization, globalization and information technology has made the public to be more enlightened and abreast with the activities of government and so can oppose government decisions if they are unfavourable. This tends to increase government need for more and better information in order to satisfy the public. Consequently, this paper examined the issue of fuel subsidy removal in Nigeria, the impact of the policy on the public as well as the country and the role marketing principles would have played if the Nigerian government had taken some time to investigate what should be done, how it should be done and when it should be done. It also proposed a roadmap for future policies that have direct implications for the general public.</description>

      <title>Merchants of Vulnerabilities: How Bug Bounty Programs Benefit Software Vendors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities enable exploitation by malicious hackers, compromising systems and data security. This paper examines bug bounty programs (BBPs) that incentivize ethical hackers to discover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to software vendors. Using game-theoretic models, we capture the strategic interactions between software vendors, ethical hackers, and malicious hackers. First, our analysis shows that software vendors can increase expected profits by participating in BBPs, explaining their growing adoption and the success of BBP platforms. Second, we find that vendors with BBPs will release software earlier, albeit with more potential vulnerabilities, as BBPs enable coordinated vulnerability disclosure and mitigation. Third, the optimal number of ethical hackers to invite to a BBP depends solely on the expected number of malicious hackers seeking exploitation. This optimal number of ethical hackers is lower than but increases with the expected malicious hacker count. Finally, higher bounties incentivize ethical hackers to exert more effort, thereby increasing the probability that they will discover severe vulnerabilities first while reducing the success probability of malicious hackers. These findings highlight BBPs' potential benefits for vendors beyond profitability. Earlier software releases are enabled by managing risks through coordinated disclosure. As cybersecurity threats evolve, BBP adoption will likely gain momentum, providing vendors with a valuable tool for enhancing security posture and stakeholder trust. Moreover, BBPs envelop vulnerability identification and disclosure into new market relationships and transactions, impacting software vendors' incentives regarding product security choices like release timing.</description>
