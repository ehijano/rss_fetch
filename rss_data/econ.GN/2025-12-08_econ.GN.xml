      <title>Job Satisfaction Through the Lens of Social Media: Rural--Urban Patterns in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a novel large-scale social-media-based measure of U.S. job satisfaction, constructed by applying a fine-tuned large language model to 2.6 billion georeferenced tweets, and link it to county-level labor market conditions (2013-2023). Logistic regressions show that rural counties consistently report lower job satisfaction sentiment than urban ones, but this gap decreases under tight labor markets. In contrast to widening rural-urban income disparities, perceived job quality converges when unemployment is low, suggesting that labor market slack, not income alone, drives spatial inequality in subjective work-related well-being.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Trade and Financial Openness on Operational Efficiency and Growth: Evidence from Turkish Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between trade and financial openness, as well as the operational efficiency and growth of Turkish banks, from 2010 to 2023. Utilizing CAMELG-DEA and dynamic panel data analysis, the study finds that increased trade openness significantly enhances banking efficiency, primarily due to heightened demand for banking services related to international trade. Financial openness further boosts growth by facilitating capital flows, expanding banks' credit portfolios, and increasing fee income from cross-border transactions. However, poverty levels have a negative impact on bank performance, reducing financial intermediation and innovation opportunities. The results underscore the crucial role of trade and financial openness in fostering banking sector growth in developing economies.</description>

      <title>The Fractured Metropolis: Optimization Cutoffs, Uneven Congestion, and the Spatial Politics of Globalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The divergence in globalization strategies between the US (retrenchment and polarization) and China (expansion) presents a puzzle that traditional distributional theories fail to fully explain. This paper offers a novel framework by conceptualizing the globalized economy as a "Congestible Club Good," leading to a "Fractured Metropolis." We argue that globalization flows ($M$) are constrained by domestic Institutional Capacity ($K$), which is heterogeneous and historically contingent. We introduce the concept of the "Optimization Cutoff": globalization incentivized the US to bypass costly domestic upgrades in favor of global expansion, leading to the long-term neglect of Public Capacity ($K_{Public}$). This historical path created a deep polarization. "Congested Incumbents," reliant on the stagnant $K_{Public}$, experience globalization as chaos ($MC&gt;MB$), while "Insulated Elites" use Private Capacity ($K_{Private}$) to bypass bottlenecks ($MB&gt;MC$). This divergence paralyzes the consensus needed to restore $K_{Public}$, creating a "Capacity Trap" where protectionism becomes the politically rational, yet economically suboptimal, equilibrium. Empirically, we construct an Institutional Congestion Index using textual analysis (2000-2024), revealing an exponential surge in disorder-related keywords (from 272 hits to 1,333). We triangulate this perception with the material failure of $K_{Public}$, such as the 3.7 million case backlog in US immigration courts. Our findings suggest the crisis of globalization is fundamentally a crisis of uneven institutional capacity and the resulting political paralysis.</description>

      <title>Entry deterrence and antibiotic conservation under post-entry Bertrand competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how an incumbent antibiotic monopolist responds to the threat of post-entry Bertrand competition by a vertically differentiated rival. In a two-period model where current production drives future resistance, Bertrand competition leads to a winner-take-all outcome. We find that strategic deterrence is optimal regardless of bacterial cross-resistance to prospective rival drugs. In contrast with post-entry Cournot competition, anticipated price competition provides the incumbent with a stronger strategic incentive for conservation.</description>

      <title>Assessment and Prioritization of Renewable Energy Alternatives to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals in Turkiye: Based on Fuzzy AHP Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to prioritize renewable energy sources to achieve sustainable development in Turkiye by using fuzzy AHP method. In our study, we used 30 criteria that affect the investment in renewable energy sources. We also calculated the weights of these criteria in investment decisions. In addition, we analyzed the advantageous renewable energy sources according to each criterion. Thus, it was determined which renewable energy source is advantageous according to which criteria. The results show that the most important main criteria for renewable energy investments in Turkiye are economic, political, technical, environmental and social criteria, respectively. The most appropriate renewable energy sources according to economic, political, technical and social criteria are solar, wind, hydroelectric,</description>

      <title>The Impact of Natural Disasters on Food Security in Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food security refers to people's access to enough safe nutritious food in order to be able to lead a healthy active life. It also involves elements such as food availability and affordability, as well as people being able to access food that can be consumed healthily. Natural disasters, however, can seriously threaten food security. Disasters' effects on food security are especially more evident in countries such as Turkiye that are frequently exposed to natural disasters due to their geologic and geographical structure. For this reason, the study investigates the effects of natural disasters on food security in Turkiye. The research first creates the Food Security Index in order to estimate the effects of natural disasters on food security. The next phase follows the process of econometric analysis, which consists of three steps. Step one of the econometric analysis uses unit root tests to check the stationarity levels of the series. The second step uses the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test to examine the long-term relationship between natural disasters and food security. The third and final step estimates the effects of natural disasters on food security. According to the obtained results, the study shows earthquakes, storms, and floods to have a significant short- as well as long-term negative effect on food security. The overall impact of natural disasters on food security has also been determined to be negative.</description>

      <title>Do Distributional Concerns Justify Lower Environmental Taxes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should taxes on externality-generating activities be adjusted if they are regressive? In our model, the government raises revenue using distortionary income and commodity taxes. If more or less productive people have identical tastes for externality-generating consumption, the government optimally imposes a Pigouvian tax equal to the marginal damage from the externality. This is true regardless of whether the tax is regressive. But, if regressivity reflects different preferences of people with different incomes rather than solely income effects, the optimal tax differs from the Pigouvian benchmark. We derive sufficient statistics for optimal policy, and use them to study carbon taxation in the United States. Our empirical results suggest an optimal carbon tax that is remarkably close to the Pigouvian level, but with higher carbon taxes for very high-income households if this is feasible. When we allow for heterogeneity in preferences at each income level as well as across the income distribution, our optimal tax schedules are further attenuated toward the Pigouvian benchmark.</description>

      <title>Beyond Automation: Redesigning Jobs with LLMs to Enhance Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to lead to fundamental shifts in the labour market, resulting in displacement or augmentation of AI-exposed roles. To investigate the impact of AI across a large organisation, we assessed AI exposure at the task level within roles at the UK Civil Service (UKCS). Using a novel dataset of UKCS job adverts, covering 193,497 vacancies over 6 years, our large language model (LLM)-driven analysis estimated AI exposure scores of 1,542,411 tasks. By aggregating AI exposure scores for tasks within each role, we calculated the mean and variance of job-level exposure to AI, highlighting the heterogeneous impacts of AI, even for seemingly identical jobs. We then use an LLM to redesign jobs, focusing on task automation, task optimisation, and task reallocation. We find that the redesign process leads to tasks where humans have comparative advantage over AI, including strategic leadership, complex problem resolution, and stakeholder management. Overall, automation and augmentation are expected to have nuanced effects across all levels of the organisational hierarchy. Most economic value of AI is expected to arise from productivity gains rather than role displacement. We contribute to the automation, augmentation and productivity debates as well as advance our understanding of job redesign in the age of AI.</description>

      <title>Peakspan: Defining, Quantifying and Extending the Boundaries of Peak Productive Lifespan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented extension of the human lifespan necessitates a parallel evolution in how we quantify the quality of aging and its socioeconomic impact. Traditional metrics focusing on Healthspan (years free of disease) overlook the gradual erosion of physiological capacity that occurs even in the absence of illness, leading to declines in productivity and eventual lack of capacity to work. To address this critical gap, we introduce Peakspan: the age interval during which an individual maintains at least 90% of their peak functional performance in a specific physiological or cognitive domain. Our multi-system analysis reveals a profound misalignment: most biological systems reach maximal capacity in early adulthood, resulting in a Peakspan that is remarkably short relative to the total lifespan. This dissociation means humans now spend the majority of their adult lives in a "healthy but declined" state, characterized by a significant functional gap. We argue that extending Peakspan and developing strategies to restore function in post-peak individuals is the functional manifestation of rejuvenative biomedical progress and is essential for sustained economic growth in aging societies. Recognizing and tracking Peakspan, increasingly facilitated by artificial intelligence and foundational models of biological aging, is crucial for developing strategies to compress functional morbidity and maximize human potential across the life course.</description>

      <title>Developing synthetic microdata through machine learning for firm-level business surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public-use microdata samples (PUMS) from the United States (US) Census Bureau on individuals have been available for decades. However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Optimization for European Electricity System Planning Considering Regional Dunkelflaute Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion of wind and solar power is driving the European energy system transformation, thereby also driving our reliance on this weather-dependent resources. Integrating renewable scarcity events into long-term planning has therefore become essential. This study demonstrates how worst-case regional renewable scarcity events - such as the Dunkelflaute, prolonged periods of low wind and solar availability - can be incorporated endogenously into the planning of a weather-robust, interconnected energy system. We develop a capacity expansion model for a fully decarbonized European electricity system using an adaptive robust optimization framework which incorporates multiple extreme weather realizations within a single optimization run. Results show that system costs rise nonlinearly with the geographic extent of these events: a single worst-case regional disruption increases costs by 9%, but broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to much sharper increases, up to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across most of Europe, additional cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of 71%. The optimal technology mix evolves with the severity of weather stress: while renewables, batteries, and interregional transmission are sufficient to manage localized events, large-scale disruptions require long-term hydrogen storage and load shedding to maintain system resilience. Central European regions, especially Germany and France, emerge as systemic bottlenecks, while peripheral regions bear the cost of compensatory overbuilding. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated European policy strategy that goes beyond national planning to support cross-border infrastructure investment, scale up flexible technologies such as long-duration storage, and promote a geographically balanced deployment of renewables to mitigate systemic risks associated with Dunkelflaute events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extended version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX-v1-extended), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier models are capable of performing economically valuable tasks in four jobs: investment banking associate, management consultant, big law associate, and primary care physician (MD). This technical report details the extensions to APEX-v1, including an increase in the held-out evaluation set from n = 50 to n = 100 cases per job (n = 400 total) and updates to the grading methodology. We present a new leaderboard, where GPT5 (Thinking = High) remains the top performing model with a score of 67.0%. APEX-v1-extended shows that frontier models still have substantial limitations when performing typical professional tasks. To support further research, we are open sourcing n = 25 non-benchmark example cases per role (n = 100 total) along with our evaluation harness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the health consequences of redistributing political power through the 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act, which eliminated barriers to voting for previously disenfranchised nonwhite populations. The intervention led to broad declines in under-five mortality but sharply contrasting effects in other age groups: mortality fell among non-white children, younger adults, and older women, yet rose among whites and older non-white men. These differences cannot be reconciled by changes in population composition or material conditions. Instead, we present evidence suggesting psychosocial stress and retaliatory responses arising from perceived status threat as key mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Automated scanning could make at-scale digitization feasible, unlocking this visual record of the 20th Century for the digital era. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</description>
