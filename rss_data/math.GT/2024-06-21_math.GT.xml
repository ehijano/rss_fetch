      <title>Flat-virtual knot: introduction and some invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivation for this work is to construct a map from classical knots to virtual ones. What we get in the paper is a series of maps from knots in the full torus (thickened torus) to flat-virtual knots. We give definition of flat-virtual knots and presents Alexander-like polynomial and (picture-valued) Kauffman bracket for them.</description>

      <title>Properties of minimal charts and their applications X: charts of type $(5,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charts are oriented labeled graphs in a disk. Any simple surface braid (2-dimensional braid) can be described by using a chart. Also, a chart represents an oriented closed surface embedded in 4-space. In this paper, we investigate embedded surfaces in 4-space by using charts. Let $\Gamma$ be a chart, and we denote by $\Gamma_m$ the union of all the edges of label $m$. A chart $\Gamma$ is of type $(5,2)$ if there exists a label $m$ such that $w(\Gamma)=7$, $w(\Gamma_m\cap\Gamma_{m+1})=5$, $w(\Gamma_{m+1}\cap\Gamma_{m+2})=2$ where $w(G)$ is the number of white vertices in $G$. In this paper, we investigate a minimal chart of type $(5,2)$.</description>

      <title>Achirality of Sol 3-Manifolds, Stevenhagen Conjecture and Shimizu's L-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A closed orientable manifold is {\em achiral} if it admits an orientation reversing homeomorphism. A commensurable class of closed manifolds is achiral if it contains an achiral element, or equivalently, each manifold in $\CM$ has an achiral finite cover.
  Each commensurable class containing non-orientable elements must be achiral.
  It is natural to wonder how many
  commensurable classes are achiral and how many achiral classes have non-orientable elements.
  We study this problem for Sol 3-manifolds. Each commensurable class $\CM$ of Sol 3-manifold has a complete topological invariant $D_{\CM}$, the discriminant of $\CM$. Our main result is:
  (1) Among all commensurable classes of Sol 3-manifolds, there are infinitely many achiral classes; however ordered by discriminants, the density of achiral commensurable classes is 0.
  (2) Among all achiral commensurable classes of Sol 3-manifolds, ordered by discriminants, the density of classes containing non-orientable elements is $1-\rho$,
  where $$\rho:=\prod_{j=1}^\infty \left(1+2^{-j}\right)^{-1} = 0.41942\cdots.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [13], K. Kaur, S. Kamada et al. posed a problem of finding a virtual knot, if exists, with an unknotting index (n,m), for any pair of non-negative integers (n,m). In this paper, we address this question by providing infinite families of virtual knots with unknotting index (n,m), for a given pair of non-negative integers (n,m). Additionally, we extend our result for virtual links also.</description>

      <title>The Alexander and Markov theorems for strongly involutive links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alexander theorem (1923) and the Markov theorem (1936) are two classical results in knot theory that show respectively that every link is the closure of a braid and that braids that have the same closure are related by a finite number of operations called Markov moves. This paper presents specialized versions of these two classical theorems for a class of links in S3 preserved by an involution, that we call strongly involutive links. When connected, these links are known as strongly invertible knots, and have been extensively studied. We develop an equivariant closure map that, given two palindromic braids, produces a strongly involutive link. We demonstrate that this map is surjective up to equivalence of strongly involutive links. Furthermore, we establish that pairs of palindromic braids that have the same equivariant closure are related by an equivariant version of the original Markov moves.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>A Heegaard-Floer TQFT for link cobordisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Heegaard-Floer homology functor from the category of oriented links in closed $3$-manifolds and oriented surface cobordisms in $4$-manifolds connecting them to the category of $\mathbb{F}[v]$-modules and $\mathbb{F}[v]$-homomorphisms between them, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the field with two elements. In comparison with previously defined TQFTs for decorated links and link cobordisms, the construction of this paper has the advantage of being independent from the decoration. Some of the basic properties of this functor are also explored.</description>

      <title>Relative Group Trisections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trisections of closed 4-manifolds, first defined and studied by Gay and Kirby, have proved to be a useful tool in the systematic analysis of 4-manifolds via handlebodies. Subsequent work of Abrams, Gay, and Kirby established a connection with the algebraic notion of a group trisection, which strikingly defines a one-to-one correspondence. We generalize the notion of a group trisection to the non-closed case by defining and studying relative group trisections. We establish an analogous one-to-one correspondence between relative trisections and relative group trisections up to equivalence. The key lemma in the construction may be of independent interest, as it generalizes the classical fact that there is a unique handlebody extension of a surface realizing a given surjection. Moreover, we establish a functorial relationship between relative trisections of manifolds and groups, extending work of Klug in the closed case.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm that, given a prime $p$ as input, determines whether or not the Burau representation of the 3-strand braid group modulo $p$ is faithful. We also prove that the representation is indeed faithful when $p\le 13$. Additionally, we re-pose Salter's question on the Burau representation of $B_3$ over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p$, and solve it for every $p$.</description>

      <title>Average edge order of normal $3$-pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their work [9], Feng Luo and Richard Stong introduced the concept of the average edge order, denoted as $\mu_0(K)$. They demonstrated that if $\mu_0(K)\leq \frac{9}{2}$ for a closed $3$-manifold $K$, then $K$ must be a sphere. Building upon this foundation, Makoto Tamura extended similar results to $3$-manifolds with non-empty boundaries in [10, 11]. In our present study, we extend these findings to normal $3$-pseudomanifolds. Specifically, we establish that for a normal $3$-pseudomanifold $K$ with singularities, $\mu_0(K)\geq\frac{30}{7}$. Moreover, equality holds if and only if $K$ is a one-vertex suspension of $\mathbb{RP}^2$ with seven vertices. Furthermore, we establish that when $\frac{30}{7}\leq\mu_0(K)\leq\frac{9}{2}$, the $3$-pseudomanifold $K$ can be derived from some boundary complexes of $4$-simplices by a sequence of possible operations, including connected sums, bistellar $1$-moves, edge contractions, edge expansions, vertex folding, and edge folding. In the end, we discuss some normal $3$-pseudomanifolds exhibiting higher average edge orders.</description>

Abstract: We conjecture an upper bound on the growth of the Yokota invariant of polyhedral graphs, extending a previous result on the growth of the $6j$-symbol. Using Barrett's Fourier transform we are able to prove this conjecture in a large family of examples. As a consequence of this result, we prove the Turaev-Viro Volume Conjecture for a new infinite family of hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

      <title>The homomorphism defect of an extended Levine-Tristram signature via twisted homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.02993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking the Levine-Tristram signature of the closure of a braid defines a map from the braid group to the integers. A formula of Gambaudo and Ghys provides an evaluation of the homomorphism defect of this map in terms of the Burau representation and the Meyer cocycle. In 2017 Cimasoni and Conway generalized this formula to the multivariable signature of the closure of coloured tangles. In the present paper, we extend even further their result by using a different 4-dimensional interpretation of the signature. We obtain an evaluation of the additivity defect in terms of the Maslov index and the isotropic functor $\mathscr{F}_\omega$. We also show that in the case of coloured braids this defect can be rewritten in terms of the Meyer cocycle and the coloured Gassner representation, making it a direct generalization of the formula of Gambaudo and Ghys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending Haken's Theorem to product annuli and disks for Heegaard splittings of sutured manifolds, we show that the handle number of an irreducible sutured manifold equals the handle number of its guts. We further show that reduced sutured manifolds with torus boundary contained in $S^3$ fall in to three types that generalize the three models of guts of knots that are nearly fibered in the instanton or Heegaard Floer sense. In conjunction with these results and another concerning uniqueness of incompressible Seifert surfaces, we show that while many nearly fibered knots have handle number $2$ and a unique incompressible Seifert surface, some have handle number $4$ and others have extra incompressible Seifert surfaces. Examples of nearly fibered knots with non-isotopic incompressible Seifert surfaces are exhibited.</description>

Our criterion applies to boundary connected sums and 1-handle attachments. Moreover, we generalize a well-known additivity result in the case of aspherical manifolds. Our arguments are based on new results about relative bounded cohomology and pairs of multicomplexes, which are of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: For all Zarski dense Anosov subgroups of a semisimple real algebraic group, we prove that their limit sets are Ahlfors regular for intrinsic conformal premetrics. As a consequence, we obtain that a Patterson-Sullivan measure is equal to the Hausdorff measure if and only if the associated linear form is symmetric. We also discuss several applications, including analyticity of $(p,q)$-Hausdorff dimensions on the Teichm\"uller spaces, new upper bounds on the growth indicator, and $L^2$-spectral properties of associated locally symmetric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Manifolds realized as orbit spaces of non-free $\mathbb Z_2^k$-actions on real moment-angle manifolds</title>

Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ corresponding to a simple convex $n$ polytope $P$ with $m$ facets. The criterion when the orbit space $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a topological manifold (perhaps with a boundary) can be extracted from results by M.A. Mikhailova and C. Lange. For any dimension $n$ we construct series of manifolds $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ homeomorphic to $S^n$ and series of manifolds $M^n=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ admitting a hyperelliptic involution $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, that is an involution $\tau$ such that $M^n/\langle\tau\rangle$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. For any simple $3$-polytope $P$ we classify all subgroups $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$. For any simple $3$-polytope $P$ and any subgroup $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ we classify all hyperelliptic involutions $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ acting on $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$. As a corollary we obtain that a $3$-dimensional small cover has $3$ hyperelliptic involutions in $\mathbb Z_2^3$ if and only if it is a rational homology $3$-sphere and if and only if it correspond to a triple of Hamiltonian cycles such that each edge of the polytope belongs to exactly two of them.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone and Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a smooth manifold, we associate to any closed differential form a mapping cone complex. The cohomology of this mapping cone complex can vary with the de Rham cohomology class of the closed form. We present a novel Morse theoretical description for the mapping cone cohomology. Specifically, we introduce a Morse complex for the mapping cone complex which is generated by pairs of critical points with the differential defined by gradient flows and an integration of the closed form over spaces of gradient flow lines. We prove that the cohomology of our cone Morse complex is isomorphic to the mapping cone cohomology and hence independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex. We also obtain sharp inequalities that bound the dimension of the mapping cone cohomology in terms of the number of Morse critical points and the properties of the specified closed form. Our results are widely applicable, especially for any manifold equipped with a geometric structure described by a closed differential form. We also obtain a bound on the difference between the number of Morse critical points and the Betti numbers.</description>
