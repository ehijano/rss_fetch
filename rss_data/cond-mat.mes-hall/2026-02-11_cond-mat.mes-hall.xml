      <title>Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in semiconductor nanostructures with negative-U shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect is demonstrated for the first time at room temperature. The diamagnetic response of a silicon nanostructure with edge channels covered by chains of negative U dipole boron centers is studied when put in (removed from) an external magnetic field. Measurements of the diamagnetic response were carried out by recording the values of magnetization and generation currents. There is good agreement between the results of measurements of the generated internal magnetic field obtained using a ferroprobe and recording the EMF induced by the occurrence of generation currents in an external magnetic field, which determines the conditions of the mechanism of the nondissipative transport in the edge channels at room temperature, which is caused by their interactions with single carriers through negative U dipole boron centers. The interrelation of the magnetization hysteresis and the magnitude of the EMF induced by the occurrence of generation currents indicates the possibilities of the electrical registration of the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in nanostructures manufactured within the framework of the Hall geometry.</description>

Abstract: The electrical, magnetic and optical properties of edge channels consisting of spin circuits that contain single carriers in nanostructures of silicon, silicon carbide and cadmium fluoride are investigated. It is demonstrated that due to the presence of chains of negative-U dipole centers at the boundaries of the spin circuits, the latter are Andreev molecules for generating terahertz radiation.</description>

      <title>Negative Hybridization: a Potential Cure for Braiding with Imperfect Majorana Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes, the elementary building blocks for the quantum bits of topological quantum computers, are known to suffer from hybridization as their wavefunctions begin to overlap. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, splitting their energy levels and leading to an accumulation of error when performing topological quantum gates. Here we show that the energy splitting of the Majorana zero modes can become negative, which can be utilized to reduce the average hybridization energy of the total gate. We present two illustrative examples where negative hybridization suppresses gate errors to such an extent that they remain below the fault-tolerance threshold. As an intrinsic property of Majorana zero modes, negative hybridization enables systems based on imperfect Majorana zero modes to regain functionality for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Coherence Protection for Mobile Spin Qubits in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09179v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile spin qubit architectures promise flexible connectivity for efficient quantum error correction and relaxed device layout constraints, but their viability rests on preserving spin coherence during transport. While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\,\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\,\mu\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\text{sh}} = 21\,\mu\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real-space electron dynamics in graphene driven by strong laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the three-dimensional (3D) electron dynamics of graphene in real space under strong laser fields using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We successfully reproduce the reversal of current direction originating from the cancellation of two oppositely directed residual currents, as previously predicted by Morimoto et al. [Y. Morimoto et al., New J. Phys. 24, 033051 (2022)]. By distinguishing contributions from individual orbitals, our results validate the two-level system approximation and also emphasize that the first-principles approach agrees better with experimental results for light-driven residual current, especially in extremely strong fields. Furthermore, our 3D model reveals that the real-space atomic-scale current induced by strong laser fields is concentrated slightly above and below the graphene basal plane, rather than strictly within it. The two oppositely directed currents exhibit a pronounced height separation in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the ring current is not confined to the graphene plane but forms a rotating 3D circulation loop which is absent in the reduced-dimensional model.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Qubit Flux Noise Simulated from Materials-Specific Disordered Exchange Interactions Between Paramagnetic Adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.</description>

      <title>Origin of Moir\'{e} Potentials in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ Heterobilayers: Contributions from Lattice Reconstruction and Interlayer Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'{e} superlattices formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers have emerged as an exciting platform to explore the quantum many-body physics. The key mechanism is the introduction of moir\'{e} potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moir\'{e} potentials in both R-type and H-type moir\'{e} patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moir\'{e} potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moir\'{e} and 40 meV for an H-type moir\'{e}. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moir\'{e} potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moir\'{e}s. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moir\'{e} site for an R-type moir\'{e}, while around different moir\'{e} site for an H-type one.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of spin waves by lattice dislocation defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-wave propagation in magnetic insulators in the presence of lattice dislocations. Within a continuum magnetoelastic framework, we show that the strain fields generated by dislocations induce equilibrium magnetic textures. The morphology of these textures depends sensitively on the dislocation type and acts as a localized scattering potential for spin-wave excitations. As a result, the scattering response exhibits pronounced asymmetries and interference effects governed by the magnetoelastic coupling and the dislocation type. By combining numerical simulations with analytical scattering theory, we compute differential cross sections and frequency-dependent transmission coefficients. Furthermore, analysis of the effective potential landscape reveals that the defect forms a barrier that modulates spin-wave transport and, crucially, breaks the intrinsic reflectionless nature of magnetic domain walls. Our findings identify lattice dislocations as tunable scattering centers, opening new avenues for defect engineering in magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of Room-temperature Stair-stepped Quantum Spin Hall States in Bi4Br4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators host exotic quantum phenomena such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, which enables dissipationless one-dimensional edge conduction. Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in {\alpha}-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes {\alpha} Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems.</description>

      <title>High-Harmonic Spin and Charge Pumping in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of highly nonlinear spin and charge pumping in an altermagnetic system driven by magnetic dynamics. The nonrelativistic spin-momentum coupling inherent to altermagnets generates a giant momentum dependent spin splitting, leading to strong spin-flip scattering in the presence of a precessing magnetic order driving the altermagnetic system out of equilibrium. Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes. Notably, in contrast to ferromagnetic and conventional antiferromagnetic systems, where nonlinear emission typically requires additional spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets intrinsically support high-harmonic spin and charge pumping. These results identify altermagnetic systems as a promising platform for efficient THz emitters and highly nonlinear spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Refined DFT recipe and renormalisation of band-edge parameters for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$ informed by the measured spin-orbit splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conduction band-edge spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides determines a competition between bright and dark excitons and sets conditions for spintronics applications of these semiconductors. Here, we report the SOS measurement for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$, found from the threshold density, $n_*$, for the upper spin-orbit-split band population, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the values expected from the conventional density functional theory (DFT). Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments.</description>

      <title>Disentangling orbital and confinement contributions to $g$-factor in Ge/SiGe hole quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits are typically operated in the lowest orbital of a quantum dot to minimize interference from nearby states. In valence-band hole systems, strong spin-orbit coupling links spin and orbital degrees of freedom, strongly influencing the hole $g$-factor, a key parameter for qubit control. We investigate the out-of-plane $g$-factor in Ge quantum dots using excitation (single-particle) and addition (many-body) spectra. Excitation spectra allow us to distinguish the pure Zeeman $g$-factor from orbital contributions to the magnetic field splitting of states despite the strong spin-orbit coupling. This distinction clarifies discrepancies between $g$-factors extracted with the two methods, for different orbital states and different hole numbers. Furthermore, we find gate-tunability of $g$-factors at the level of 15%, highlighting its relevance for all-electric qubit manipulation.</description>

      <title>Universality classes split by strong and weak symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions are strongly shaped by the symmetries of the Liouvillian, yet the quantitative impact of weak and strong symmetries on critical behavior has remained unclear. We study a squeezed-photon model with single- and two-photon losses, realizing weak and strong symmetries in the simplest possible setting. The two symmetries exhibit identical Gaussian static fluctuations, whereas the order parameter and the asymptotic decay rate display distinct scaling behaviors. Our one-loop Keldysh analysis, together with cumulant-expansion numerics, reveals sharply different critical scaling with respect to the thermodynamic scaling parameter. This establishes that weak and strong symmetries lead to distinct dynamical universality classes despite originating from the same symmetry group in the closed system. Our results provide a clear quantitative demonstration that strong symmetries fundamentally reshape dissipative criticality.</description>

      <title>Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods of ferroelectricity control are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains, and appropriate modelling of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the nanoparticles are absent too. In this work we study the influence of chemical stresses on phase diagrams and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, antipolar and nonpolar order parameters. It appeared that the ferroelectric phase can be reentrant with respect to the size of nanoparticles, because the spontaneous polarization exists in the limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_c&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is mainly determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The maximal critical radius R_cr^max is mainly determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses, which are induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Analytical expressions derived for the critical radii can be generalized for hafnium-zirconium oxide nanoparticles, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations.</description>

      <title>How Far Can You Grow? Characterizing the Extrapolation Frontier of Graph Generative Models for Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every generative model for crystalline materials harbors a critical structure size beyond which its outputs quietly become unreliable -- we call this the extrapolation frontier. Despite its direct consequences for nanomaterial design, this frontier has never been systematically measured. We introduce RADII, a radius-resolved benchmark of ${\sim}$75,000 nanoparticle structures (55-11,298 atoms) that treats radius as a continuous scaling knob to trace generation quality from in-distribution to out-of-distribution regimes under leakage-free splits. RADII provides frontier-specific diagnostics: per-radius error profiles pinpoint each architecture's scaling ceiling, surface-interior decomposition tests whether failures originate at boundaries or in bulk, and cross-metric failure sequencing reveals which aspect of structural fidelity breaks first. Benchmarking five state-of-the-art architectures, we find that: (i) all models degrade by ${\sim}13\%$ in global positional error beyond training radii, yet local bond fidelity diverges wildly across architectures -- from near-zero to over $2\times$ collapse; (ii) no two architectures share the same failure sequence, revealing the frontier as a multi-dimensional surface shaped by model family; and (iii) well-behaved models obey a power-law scaling exponent $\alpha \approx 1/3$ whose in-distribution fit accurately predicts out-of-distribution error, making their frontiers quantitatively forecastable. These findings establish output scale as a first-class evaluation axis for geometric generative models. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/RADII.</description>

      <title>Real-space topology and charge order in the Haldane-Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the half-filled Haldane-Holstein model, where a paradigmatic Chern insulator is coupled to fully dynamical phonons, and provide an unbiased characterization of how retarded electron-phonon interactions destabilize Chern topology. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quantum Size Effect and Tensile Strain on Surface Morphology of Sn(100) Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum size effect (QSE) and strain effect are two key factors influencing the surface morphology of thin films, which can increase film surface roughness through QSE-induced thickness oscillation and strain-induced island formation, respectively. Surface roughness usually manifests in the early stages of film growth and diminishes beyond a critical thickness. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow Sn(100) islands with varying thickness N on bilayer graphene-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal an inverse surface roughness effect that highlights the interplay of QSE and misfit strain in shaping the surface morphology of Sn(100) islands. For N =&lt; 10, the islands exhibit flat surfaces, while for N &gt;= 26, the island surfaces become corrugated and patterned. For the intermediate range, i.e., 12 =&lt; N =&lt;24, both flat and patterned surfaces coexist, with the percentage coverage of the patterned surface oscillating as a function of N. By performing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the unusual surface pattern evolution in our MBE-grown Sn(100) islands is a result of the interplay between QSE-induced surface roughing and tensile strain-induced smoothening effect.</description>

      <title>Surface-State-Driven Anomalous Hall Effect in Altermagnetic MnTe Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a new class of magnetic materials that combine compensated magnetic order with spin-split electronic band structures. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow MnTe thin films with controlled thickness on InP(111)A substrates. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, we observe a large spin splitting of ~230 meV for bulk bands well below the Fermi level and identify surface states that cross the Fermi level. Electrical transport measurements reveal that a robust anomalous Hall (AH) effect persists down to 2 K and an AH sign reversal occurs near 175 K. By systematically tuning film thickness, growth conditions, and interfacial structure, we demonstrate that the AH response in MnTe films originates from the Berry curvature of surface states rather than from bulk bands. Our first-principles calculations reveal that this surface-state-driven AH effect is imprinted by the bulk altermagnetic order and remains unchanged for terminations with opposite Mn magnetic orientations. Our results establish a unique surface transport probe of bulk altermagnetism, demonstrate interface engineering as an effective route to generate and control the AH effect in altermagnets, and provide a unified understanding of the AH response in altermagentic MnTe films.</description>

      <title>Competing magnetic states in a non-coplanar Kagome magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Multiple Layer-Selective Polar Charge Density Waves in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ is a polar charge density wave (CDW) material, with giant thermal hysteresis and non-volatile state switching under electric and optical fields, attracting great attention in recent years. However, the in-depth understanding of these anomalous phenomena remains elusive. Herein, via first-principles calculations, we reveal that the polar CDW state in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ hosts a novel layer-selective nature, wherein multiple energetically close CDW configurations coexist and exhibit low interconversion energy barriers. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the giant thermal hysteresis in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ originates from a phase transition mainly driven by the change of configurational entropy, around which the material hosts a metastable CDW state characterized by diverse local polar configurations breaking the out-of-plane translational symmetry. The configurational composition of this metastable CDW state can be effectively controlled by electric and optical fields, thereby enabling non-volatile state switching. Our theoretical findings align well with recent experimental observations in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ and pave the way for exploring the emerging phenomena and applications of polar CDW in multilayered systems.</description>

      <title>Framework for (non-)adiabatic chiral state conversion: from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to Liouvillians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic chiral state conversion (CSC) is one of the many counterintuitive effects associated with non-Hermitian physics. In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a special kind of nonreciprocal electromagnetic response which gives rise to backscattering suppression in the bulk, a long-sought feature in topological photonics, as well as nonreciprocal lensing - an effect when the same structure focuses light incident from one direction and defocuses light propagating in the opposite way. We predict this response in spin spirals and in specially designed metamaterials, validating the key predictions.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent linear response for gapped nodal-line semimetals in planar-Hall configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric ($\mathbf E $) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields. The net conductivity tensor has components comprising the Drude, anomalous-Hall, in-plane (with $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf B$) longitudinal and transverse, and Lorentz-force-operator-induced parts. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric: it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact, gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the St\v{r}eda formula and the formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong disorder drives conventional Hermitian systems into Anderson insulating states, suppressing all topological phases. Here, we unveil symmetry-protected, anomalous topological phases in the strong disorder limit of a non-Hermitian system, characterized by a scale-invariant merging of zero-energy modes. Using the maximally symmetric Jx lattice as an ideal platform and introducing specifically engineered (ABBA-type) symmetry-preserving non-Hermitian disorder, we observe a sequence of disorder-induced phase transitions: from a trivial insulator into and through a non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phase, culminating in a stable anomalous non-Hermitian TAI phase characterized by a quantized polarization P_x \approx 0.25. Within this anomalous phase protected by the mobility gap, the zero-energy modes exhibit a distinct (N/2)-mode coalescence that scales with system size. Our findings demonstrate that non-Hermitian disorder engineered to preserve symmetry can induce and protect novel topological order inaccessible to conventional Hermitian disorder, thereby advancing the fundamental understanding of topological phenomena mediated by the interplay of disorder and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used to establish a secret key between trusted parties. Many practical use-cases in communication networks, however, involve parties who do not trust each other. A fundamental cryptographic building block for such distrustful scenarios is quantum coin flipping, which has been investigated only in few experimental studies to date, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources imposing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate a quantum advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic quantum dot light source in combination with fast, random polarization-state encoding enabling sufficiently low quantum bit error ratio. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Perfect supercurrent diode efficiency in chiral nanotube-based weak links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE) describes superconducting systems where the magnitude of the superconducting-to-normal state switching current differs for positive and negative current bias. Despite the ubiquity of such diode effects in Josephson devices, the fundamental conditions to observe a diode effect in a Josephson junction and achieve perfect diode efficiency remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the supercurrent diode properties of a chiral nanotube-based Josephson junction within a Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find a diode effect and anomalous phase develop across the junction when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the tube despite the absence of spin-orbit interactions in the system. Unexpectedly, the SDE in the junction is independent of the anomalous phase. Alternatively, we determine a non-reciprocal persistent current that is protected by fluxoid quantization can activate SDE, even in the absence of higher-order pair tunneling processes. We show this new type of SDE can lead to, in principle, a perfect diode efficiency, highlighting how persistent currents can be used to engineer high efficiency supercurrent diodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions driven by circularly polarized light (CPL) via the inverse Faraday effect (IFE). By incorporating an inertial mass term into the Thiele equation and analytically deriving the optically induced magnetic fields and forces, we demonstrate fundamentally distinct dynamical regimes under continuous-wave (CW) versus pulsed excitation. Skyrmion inertia qualitatively transforms trajectories from smooth spirals to polygonal orbits under continuous driving, while enabling sustained post-pulse gyration that reveals the system's intrinsic relaxation dynamics. The handedness of the trajectory is determined by the topological charge and light helicity: left-circularly polarized (LCP) light attracts skyrmions toward the beam center, while right-circularly polarized (RCP) light repels them. Systematic parameter analysis reveals how Gilbert damping, optical intensity, frequency, and skyrmion mass control the transition between oscillatory and overdamped dynamical phases. Our work identifies inertia, topological charge, and light helicity as essential factors in ultrafast all-optical skyrmion manipulation and provides a theoretical model for designing topological spin textures with ultrafast light.</description>

Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.</description>

      <title>The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title>

Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description>
