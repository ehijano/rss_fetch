      <title>Effective Note-taking and its Impact on Learning Undergraduate Introductory Physics Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking notes during lectures is one of the required skills, among many others, that students need (i) to master the topic covered in the lecture, (ii) to actively engage in the learning process with minimal to no distractions, (iii) to retain learned knowledge and skills for a longer time, and (iv) in securing better grade. To learn the role of note-taking in learning undergraduate-level introductory algebra-based physics courses, we present a comparative study of students' achievement in two minority-serving universities, namely, Fayetteville State University and The University of North Carolina at Pembroke (i) when students were taught effective note-taking strategies, motivated them to prepare notes and let them use their self-prepared notes in timed assignments and exams versus (ii) no note-taking scheme was implemented, keeping all other conditions the same. The no-note-taking scheme was used in the first introductory algebra-based physics course, while the note-taking scheme was used in the second introductory algebra-based physics course. Students' scores on the final exam and aggregated grade, accounting for all grading components, are taken as measurement tools. Analysis shows that effective note-taking helps students secure better letter grades.</description>

      <title>Real-time quantitative measurement of a Stirling engine P-V diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes simple modifications to a Stirling-type heat engine that allow its P-V diagram to be measured. The main advantage of our approach is that a calibrated P-V diagram can be measured and displayed in real time as the engine is running. Our implementation uses a relatively inexpensive, but high-quality, gamma-type Stirling engine designed for demonstrations. The only modifications required to the as-purchased engine are a single hole drilled in the top plate to accommodate a pressure sensor and attaching circular choppers to the flywheel. An outer chopper is used to reset the detection electronics when the internal volume of the engine is a minimum. An inner chopper is then used to track the orientation of the flywheel. This paper describes the design of the photogates and electronics used to collect and process the data. Example data are shown to highlight the capabilities of the system.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sound, One Ping at a Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how sound propagates through different media is fundamental to both science and technology. While sound plays a critical role in natural navigation and underlies a wide range of applications - from medical ultrasound to sonar and gas analysis - its teaching in classrooms often remains limited to traditional and abstract demonstrations. This paper presents an accessible, low-cost experimental setup that enables students to measure the speed of sound in gases using time-of-flight techniques. Constructed from common materials and powered by open-source software, the device provides accurate, hands-on measurements while allowing students to explore the effects of temperature, pressure, and gas composition. By making acoustic wave physics tangible and interactive, this approach fosters deeper conceptual understanding and promotes active experimentation in diverse educational environments.</description>

      <title>Think Inside the Box: Recreating Rutherford's Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rutherford scattering experiment, conceived by Ernest Rutherford and carried out by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, provided the first direct evidence of a compact atomic nucleus, fundamentally altering the understanding of atomic structure. The original experiment involved directing alpha particles from a radioactive source toward a thin gold foil and observing their deflection using a zinc sulfide scintillation screen. This paper presents an accessible and low-cost approach to reproducing the key features of the Rutherford experiment using commercially available components, offering a practical platform for educational demonstrations and introductory nuclear physics investigations.</description>

      <title>Comparing Visual Qubit Representations in Quantum Education: The Bloch sphere Enhances Task Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual-graphical qubit representations offer a means to introduce abstract quantum concepts - such as quantum state, superposition, or measurement - in an accessible manner, particularly for learners with low prior knowledge. Building on a previous expert rating of mechanisms of qubit representations, this study compared two representations - Bloch sphere and Quantum Bead - in terms of learning outcomes, task performance, cognitive load, and mid-term retention. The study was conducted with N=149 school students. The study assessed conceptual understanding, application-oriented task performance by measuring accuracy per time, and cognitive load. A follow-up test after 1-2 weeks assessed mid-term retention. Results showed no significant effect of representation type on post-test learning outcomes. However, process data revealed that learners using the Bloch sphere completed application-oriented tasks significantly more efficiently. The cognitive load was similar in both groups. Mid-term retention of quantum concepts was stable across groups, and early learning performance emerged as the strongest predictor of mid-term retention. In conclusion, these findings emphasize that instructional impact is not solely determined by outcome measures, but also by how representations influence cognitive processing, task integration, and learners' interaction with complex content.</description>
