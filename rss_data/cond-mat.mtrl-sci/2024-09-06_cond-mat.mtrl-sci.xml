      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of predicting the performance of various ion-doped NASICON compounds by leveraging extensive datasets from prior experimental investigation.The model demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency in predicting ionic conductivity and electrochemical properties. Key findings include the successful synthesis and validation of three NASICON materials predicted by the model, with experimental results closely matching the model predictions. This research not only enhances the understanding of ion-doping effects in NASICON materials but also establishes a robust framework for material design and practical applications. It bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental validations.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks incorporating energy dissipation for the phase-field model of ferroelectric microstructure evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are an emerging technique to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we propose a simple but effective PINN approach for the phase-field model of ferroelectric microstructure evolution. This model is a time-dependent, nonlinear, and high-order PDE system of multi-physics, challenging to be solved using a baseline PINN. Considering that the acquisition of steady microstructures is one of the primary focuses in simulations of ferroelectric microstructure evolution, we simplify the time-dependent PDE system to be a static problem. This static problem, however, is ill-posed. To overcome this issue, a term originated from the law of energy dissipation is embedded into the loss function as an extra constraint for the PINN. With this modification, the PINN successfully predicts the steady ferroelectric microstructure without tracking the evolution process. In addition, although the proposed PINN approach cannot tackle the dynamic problem in a straightforward fashion, it is of benefit to the PINN prediction of the evolution process by providing labeled data. These data are crucial because they help the PINN avoid the propagation failure, a common failure mode of PINNs when predicting dynamic behaviors. The above mentioned advantages of the proposed PINN approach are demonstrated through a number of examples.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity of dipolar excitons in a double layer of $\alpha-T_3$ with a mass term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of dipolar excitons, formed by electron-hole pairs in spatially separated gapped hexagonal $\alpha-T_{3}$ (GHAT3) layers. In the $\alpha-T_{3}$ model, the AB-honeycomb lattice structure is supplemented with C atoms located at the centers of the hexagons in the lattice. We considered the $\alpha-T_{3}$ model in the presence of a mass term which opens a gap in the energy dispersive spectrum. The gap opening mass term, caused by a weak magnetic field, plays the role of Zeeman splitting at low magnetic fields for this pseudospin-1 system. The band structure of GHAT3 monolayers leads to the formation of two distinct types of excitons in the GHAT3 double layer. We consider two types of dipolar excitons in double-layer GHAT3: (a) ``A excitons'', which are bound states of electrons in the conduction band (CB) and holes in the intermediate band (IB) and (b) ``B excitons'', which are bound states of electrons in the CB and holes in the valence band (VB). The binding energy of A and B dipolar excitons is calculated. For a two-component weakly interacting Bose gas of dipolar excitons in a GHAT3 double layer, we obtain the energy dispersion of collective excitations, the sound velocity, the superfluid density, and the mean-field critical temperature $T_{c}$ for superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Nonlinear Hall Effect Induced by Lorentz Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect arises either without external magnetic field (type-I) or with an in-plane magnetic field (type-II). In this work we propose a new type of geometrical nonlinear Hall effect with an out-of-plane magnetic field (type-III) induced by the combination of Lorentz force and anomalous electronic velocity. The type-III NLH effect is proportional to the more refined structures of Bloch wave functions, i.e., the dipole moment of square of Berry curvature, thus becoming prominent near the band crossings or anticrossings. Our effective model analysis and first-principles calculations show that gate-tuned MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin film under uniaxial strain is an ideal platform to observe this effect. Especially, giant unidirectional magnetoresistance can occur in this material, based on which an efficient electrical transistor device prototype can be built. Finally a symmetry analysis indicates that type-III NLH effect has unique symmetry properties stemming from Berry curvature square dipole, which is different from other previously reported NLH effects and can exist in a wider class of magnetic crystals. Our study offers new paradigms for nonlinear electronics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kagome Materials: Theoretical Insights, Experimental Realizations, and Electronic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, kagome materials have attracted significant attention due to their rich emergent phenomena arising from the quantum interplay of geometry, topology, spin, and correlations. However, in the search for kagome materials, it has been found that bulk compounds with electronic properties related to the kagome lattice are relatively scarce, primarily due to the hybridization of kagome layers with adjacent layers. Therefore, researchers have shown increasing interest in the construction of two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials, aiming to achieve clean kagome bands near the Fermi level in monolayer or few-layer systems. Substantial advancements have already been made in this area. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the construction and development of 2D kagome lattices. We begin by introducing the geometric and electronic structures of the kagome lattice and its variants. This is followed by a discussion on the experimental realizations and electronic structure characterizations of 2D kagome materials. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future development of 2D kagome lattices.</description>

      <title>Bonding Hierarchy and Coordination Interaction Leading to High Thermoelectricity in Wide Bandgap TlAgI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High thermoelectric properties are associated with the phonon-glass electron-crystal paradigm. Conventional wisdom suggests that the optimal bandgap of semiconductor to achieve the largest power factor should be between 6 and 10 kbT. To address challenges related to the bipolar effect and temperature limitations, we present findings on Zintl-type TlAgI2, which demonstrates an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.3 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K. The achieved figure of merit (ZT) for TlAgI2, featuring a 1.55 eV bandgap, reaches a value of 2.20 for p-type semiconductor. This remarkable ZT is attributed to the existence of extended antibonding states Ag-I in the valence band. Furthermore, the bonding hierarchy, influencing phonon anharmonicity, and coordination bonds, facilitating electron transfer between the ligand and the central metal ion, significantly contribute to electronic transport. This finding serves as a promising avenue for the development of high ZT materials with wide bandgaps at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>SpinMultiNet: Neural Network Potential Incorporating Spin Degrees of Freedom with Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) have attracted significant attention as a method for accelerating density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, conventional NNP models typically do not incorporate spin degrees of freedom, limiting their applicability to systems where spin states critically influence material properties, such as transition metal oxides. This study introduces SpinMultiNet, a novel NNP model that integrates spin degrees of freedom through multi-task learning. SpinMultiNet achieves accurate predictions without relying on correct spin values obtained from DFT calculations. Instead, it utilizes initial spin estimates as input and leverages multi-task learning to optimize the spin latent representation while maintaining both $E(3)$ and time-reversal equivariance. Validation on a dataset of transition metal oxides demonstrates the high predictive accuracy of SpinMultiNet. The model successfully reproduces the energy ordering of stable spin configurations originating from superexchange interactions and accurately captures the rhombohedral distortion of the rocksalt structure. These results pave the way for new possibilities in materials simulations that consider spin degrees of freedom, promising future applications in large-scale simulations of various material systems, including magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured S@VACNTs Cathode with Lithium Sulfate Barrier Layer for Exceptionally Stable Cycling in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur technology garners significant interest due to sulfur's higher specific capacity, cost-effectiveness, and environmentally friendly aspects. However, sulfur's insulating nature and poor cycle life hinder practical application. To address this, a simple modification to the traditional sulfur electrode configuration is implemented, aiming to achieve high capacity, long cycle life, and rapid charge rates. Binder-free sulfur cathode materials are developed using vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated with sulfur and a lithium sulfate barrier layer. The aligned CNT framework provides high conductivity for electron transportation and short lithium-ion pathways. Simultaneously, the sulfate barrier layer significantly suppresses the shuttle of polysulfides. The S@VACNTs with Li 2 SO 4 coating exhibit an extremely stable reversible areal capacity of 0.9 mAh cm --2 after 1600 cycles at 1 C with a capacity retention of 80% after 1200 cycles, over three times higher than lithium iron phosphate cathodes cycled at the same rate. Considering safety concerns related to the formation of lithium dendrite, a full cell Si-Li-S is assembled, displaying good electrochemical performances for up to 100 cycles. The combination of advanced electrode architecture using 1D conductive scaffold with high-specific-capacity active material and the implementation of a novel strategy to suppress polysulfides drastically improves the stability and the performance of Li-S batteries.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in understanding and manipulating magnetic and electronic properties of Eu$M_2X_2$ ($M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past five years, significant progress has been made in understanding the magnetism and electronic properties of CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type Eu$M_2X_2$ ($M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As) compounds. Prior theoretical work and experimental studies suggested that EuCd$_2$As$_2$ had the potential to host rich topological phases, particularly an ideal magnetic Weyl semimetal state when the spins are polarized along the c axis. However, this perspective is challenged by recent experiments utilizing samples featuring ultra-low carrier densities, as well as meticulous calculations employing various approaches. Nonetheless, the Eu$M_2X_2$ family still exhibit numerous novel properties that remain to be satisfactorily explained, such as the giant nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and the colossal magnetoresistance effect. Moreover, Eu$M_2X_2$ compounds can be transformed from semiconducting antiferromagnets to metallic ferromagnets by introducing a small number of carriers or applying external pressure, and a further increase in the ferromagnetic transition temperature can be achieved by reducing the unit cell volume. These features make the Eu$M_2X_2$ family a fertile platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and charge transport, and an excellent candidate for applications in spintronics. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the magnetic and transport behaviors of Eu$M_2X_2$ compounds with varying carrier densities, as well as the current insights into these characteristics. An outlook for future research opportunities is also provided.</description>

      <title>Efficient light upconversion via resonant exciton-exciton annihilation of dark excitons in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report a pronounced light upconversion in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our joint theory-experiment study attributes the upconversion photoluminescence to a resonant exciton-exciton annihilation involving a pair of dark excitons with opposite momenta, followed by the spontaneous emission of upconverted bright excitons, which can have a high upconversion efficiency. Additionally, the upconversion photoluminescence is generic in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, showing a high tuneability from green to ultraviolet light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the attempt to induce spin-polarized states in graphene, rare-earth deposition on Gr/Co(0001) has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy: the coupling of graphene with the cobalt substrate provides spin-polarized conical-shaped states (mini-cone) and the rare-earth deposition brings these states at the Fermi level. In this manuscript we theoretically explore the feasibility of an analogue approach applied on Gr/Ni(111) doped with rare-earth ions. Even if not well mentioned in the lecture also this system owns a mini-cone, similar to the cobalt case. By testing different rare-earth ions, not only we suggest which one can provide the required doping but we explain the effect behind this proper charge transfer.</description>

      <title>Grand-potential phase field simulations of droplet growth and sedimentation in a two-phase ternary fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A methodology is built to model and simulate the dynamics of domain coarsening of a two-phase ternary liquid with an arbitrary phase diagram. High numerical performance is obtained through the use of the phase field-method for interface capturing, a lattice Boltzmann method numerical scheme for all the model equations, and a portable, parallel simulation code running on multiple GPUs. The model is benchmarked against an analytic solution for a ternary diffusion couple. It also reproduces the well-known power law for droplet coarsening during Ostwald ripening without fluid flow. Large-scale simulations with flow illustrate the effects of momentum transport and buoyancy, as well as droplet coalescence and sedimentation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spin filtering by an altermagnetic barrier in magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin filtering effect, distinct decaying lengths experienced by oppositely spin-polarized electrons in a magnetic barrier, generally occurs in ferromagnetic (FM) insulators or semiconductors. With the rise of altermagnetic (ALM) materials which exhibit similar capability of spin-polarizing electrons with ferromagnets, it is a nature question whether the ALM insulators or semiconductors can also act as unique barriers for the spin splitting effect. Here, through first-principles calculations, we investigated the complex band structure of the ALM insulator FeF$_2$ and found that it possesses an anisotropic spin filtering effect: along the [001] direction of FeF$_2$, a current remains spin-neutral but has locally nonvanishing spin polarizations in the momentum space; moreover, along the [110] direction of FeF$_2$, a current will be globally spin-polarized by different attenuation lengths of oppositely spin-polarized electrons. Leveraging this anisotropic spin filtering effect, we designed two types of MTJs with the ALM barrier: ALM electrode/ALM insulator barrier/non-magnetic (NM) electrode and FM electrode/ALM insulator barrier/NM electrode, using RuO$_2$(001)/FeF$_2$/IrO$_2$ and CrO$_2$(110)/FeF$_2$/IrO$_2$ as the corresponding prototypes, respectively. We found that these two proposed MTJs exhibited the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 216\% and 3956\%, by matching the conduction channels of the electrodes and the spin-resolved lowest decay rate of the barrier in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward the spin filtering effect for the rising ALM insulators and semiconductors, and broadens applications of the AFM spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal mechanical principles may exist behind seemingly unrelated physical phenomena, providing novel insights into these phenomena. This study sheds light on the geometrical theory of dislocations through an analogy with electromagnetics. In this theory, solving Cartan's first structure equation is essential for connecting the dislocation density to the plastic deformation field of the dislocations. The additional constraint of a divergence-free condition, derived from the Helmholtz decomposition, forms the governing equations that mirror Amp\`ere's and Gauss' law in electromagnetics. This allows for the analytical integration of the equations using the Biot-Savart law. The plastic deformation fields of screw and edge dislocations obtained through this process form both a vortex and an orthogonal coordinate system on the cross-section perpendicular to the dislocation line. This orthogonality is rooted in the conformal property of the corresponding complex function that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, leading to the complex potential of plastic deformation. We validate the results through a comparison with the classical dislocation theory. The incompatibility tensor is crucial in the generation of the mechanical field. These findings reveal a profound unification of dislocation theories, electromagnetics, and complex functions through their underlying mathematical parallels.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Small Solid Particles on Substrates of Arbitrary Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a small solid particle arising from the dewetting of a thin film on a curved substrate driven by capillarity, where mass transport is controlled by surface diffusion. We consider the case when the size of the deposited particle is much smaller than the local radius of curvature of the substrate surface. The application of the Onsager variational principle leads to a reduced-order model for the dynamic behaviour of particles on arbitrarily curved substrates. We demonstrate that particles move toward region of the substrate surface with lower mean curvature with a determined velocity. In particular, the velocity is proportional to the substrate curvature gradient and inversely proportional to the size of the particle, with a coefficient that depends on material properties that include the surface energy, surface diffusivity, density, and Young's (wetting) angle. The reduced model is validated by comparing with numerical results for the full, sharp-interface model in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Surface Magnetism in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface magnetization of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ was examined by low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) using an off-normal incidence electron beam. We found that the 180$^o$ domain walls are of Bloch type. Temperature-dependent LEEM measurements yield a surface magnetization with a surface critical exponent $\beta$1 = 0.79 +/- 0.02. This result is consistent with surface magnetism in the 3D semi-infinite Heisenberg ($\beta$1 = 0.84 +/- 0.01) or Ising ($\beta$1 = 0.78 +/- 0.02) models, which is distinctly different from the bulk exponent ($\beta$ = 0.34 +/- 0.07). The measurements reveal the power of LEEM with a tilted beam to determine magnetic domain structure in quantum materials. Single crystal diffraction measurements reveal inversion symmetry-breaking weak peaks and yield space group P-6m2. This Fe site defect-derived loss of inversion symmetry enables the formation of skyrmions in this Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ crystal.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the integration of hexagonal boron nitride crystals and thin films into graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a benchmarking protocol that combines the characterization of boron nitride (BN) crystals and films with the evaluation of the electronic properties of graphene on these substrates. Our study includes hBN crystals grown under different conditions and scalable BN films deposited by either chemical or physical vapor deposition (CVD or PVD). We explore the complete process from boron nitride growth, over its optical characterization by time-resolved cathodoluminescence (TRCL), to the optical and electronic characterization of graphene by Raman spectroscopy after encapsulation and Hall bar processing. Within our benchmarking protocol we achieve a homogeneous electronic performance within each Hall bar device through a fast and reproducible processing routine. We find that a free exciton lifetime of 1 ns measured on as-grown hBN crystals by TRCL is sufficient to achieve high graphene room temperature charge carrier mobilities of 80,000 cm$^2$/(Vs) at a carrier density of |n| = 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, while respective exciton lifetimes around 100 ps yield mobilities up to 30,000 cm$^2$/(Vs). For scalable PVD-grown BN films, we measure carrier mobilities exceeding 10,000 cm$^2$/(Vs) which correlates with a graphene Raman 2D peak linewidth of 22 cm$^{-1}$. Our work highlights the importance of the Raman 2D linewidth of graphene as a critical metric that effectively assesses the interface quality (i.e. surface roughness) to the BN substrate, which directly affects the charge carrier mobility of graphene. Graphene 2D linewidth analysis is suitable for all BN substrates and is particularly advantageous when TRCL or BN Raman spectroscopy cannot be applied to specific BN materials such as amorphous or thin films. This underlines the superior role of spatially-resolved spectroscopy in the evaluation of BN crystals and films for the use of high-mobility graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Terahertz Probes of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional spectroscopy has a long history originating from nuclear magnetic resonance, and has now found widespread application at infrared and optical frequencies as well. However, the energy scales of traditional multidimensional probes have been ill-suited for studying quantum materials. Recent technological advancements have now enabled extension of these multidimensional techniques to the terahertz frequency range, in which collective excitations of quantum materials are typically found. This Perspective introduces the technique of two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) and the unique physics of quantum materials revealed by 2DTS spectra, accompanied by a selection of the rapidly expanding experimental and theoretical literature. While 2DTS has so far been primarily applied to quantum materials at equilibrium, we provide an outlook for its application towards understanding their dynamical non-equilibrium states and beyond.</description>

      <title>Finite-size Effects in periodic EOM-CCSD for Ionization Energies and Electron Affinities: Convergence Rate and Extrapolation to the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of quasi-particle energies for periodic systems to the thermodynamic limit using increasingly large simulation cells corresponding to increasingly dense integration meshes in reciprocal space. The quasi-particle energies are computed at the level of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory for ionization (IP-EOM-CC) and electron attachment processes (EA-EOM-CC). By introducing an electronic correlation structure factor, the expected asymptotic convergence rates for systems with different dimensionality are formally derived. We rigorously test these derivations through numerical simulations for trans-Polyacetylene using IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the G0W0@HF approximation, which confirm the predicted convergence behavior. Our findings provide a solid foundation for efficient schemes to correct finite-size errors in IP/EA-EOM-CCSD calculations.</description>

      <title>SR-CLD: spatially-resolved chord length distributions for statistical description, visualization, and alignment of non-uniform microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the calculation of spatially-resolved chord length distribution (SR-CLD) as an efficient approach for quantifying and visualizing non-uniform microstructures in heterogeneous materials. SR-CLD enables detailed analysis of spatial variation of microstructure constituent sizes in different directions that can be overlooked with traditional descriptions. We present the calculation of SR-CLD using efficient scan-line algorithm that counts pixels in constituents along pixel rows or columns of microstructure images for detailed, high-resolution SR-CLD maps. We demonstrate the application of SR-CLD in two case studies: one on synthetic polycrystalline microstructures with known and intentionally created uniform and gradient spatial distributions of grain size; and one on experimental images of two-phase microstructures of additively manufactured Ti alloys with significant spatially non-uniform distributions of laths of one of the phases. Additionally, we present how SR-CLDs can enable automated, computationally efficient, and robust alignment of large sets of images for merging into accurate composite images of large microstructure areas.</description>

      <title>The landscape of symmetry enhancement in tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band structures are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics and their symmetries constrain possible degeneracies, topology and response functions across a broad range of different systems. Here we address the question: given a parent crystal, what is the symmetry of hopping models on that lattice at a given shell number? We find that the parent structure does not, in general, determine the symmetry of the tight-binding model. Instead, the symmetry is dependent on the hopping range. The key to symmetry breakdown on the lattice is the existence of different {\it bond equivalence classes} whose number is related to group-subgroup indices for a broad classes of cases. We find all bond equivalence classes for $s$-wave hopping out to 20th neighbor across the different space groups and Wyckoff positions and the symmetries of the associated tight-binding models. These observations naturally lead to the definition of a {\it bond complex} $-$ the possible classes of networks of bonds to which symmetries may be enhanced from a given parent structure.</description>

      <title>CO2-induced Drastic Decharging of Dielectric Surfaces in Aqueous Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of airborne CO2 on the charge state of carboxylate stabilized polymer latex particles suspended in aqueous electrolytes. We combine conductometric experiments interpreted in terms of Hessinger's conductivity model with Poisson-Boltzmann cell (PBC) model calculations with charge regulation boundary conditions. Without CO2, a minority of the weakly acidic surface groups are dissociated and only a fraction of the total number of counter-ions actually contribute to conductivity. The remaining counter-ions exchange freely with added other ions like Na+, K+ or Cs+. From the PBC-calculations we infer a corresponding pKa of 4.26 as well as a renormalized charge in reasonably good agreement with the number of freely mobile counter-ions. Equilibration of salt- and CO2-free suspensions against ambient air leads to a drastic de-charging, which exceeds by far the expected effects of to dissolved CO2 and its dissociation products. Further, no counter-ion-exchange is observed. To reproduce the experimental findings, we have to assume an effective pKa of 6.48. This direct influence of CO2 on the state of surface group dissociation explains our recent finding of a CO2-induced decrease of the {\zeta}-potential and supports the suggestion of an additional charge regulation caused by molecular CO2. Given the importance of charged surfaces in contact with aqueous electrolytes, we anticipate that our observations bear substantial theoretical challenges and important implications for applications ranging from desalination to bio-membranes.</description>

      <title>Origin of the laser-induced picosecond spin current across magnetization compensation in ferrimagnetic GdCo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical manipulation of magnetism enabled by rare earth-transition metal ferrimagnets holds the promise of ultrafast, energy efficient spintronic technologies. This work investigates laser-induced picosecond spin currents generated by ferrimagnetic GdCo via terahertz emission spectroscopy. A suppression of the THz emission and spin current is observed at magnetization compensation when varying the temperature or alloy composition in the presence of a magnetic field. It is demonstrated that this is due to the formation of domains in the GdCo equilibrium magnetic configuration. Without an applied magnetic field, the picosecond spin current persists at the compensation point. The experimental findings support the model for THz spin current generation based on transport of hot spin-polarized electrons, which is dominated by the Co sublattice at room temperature. Only at low temperature a comparable contribution from Gd is detected but with slower dynamics. Finally, spectral analysis reveals a blueshift of the THz emission related to the formation of magnetic domains close to magnetization compensation.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of polymers: A simple matter where complexity matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal conductivity coefficient $\kappa$ measures the ability of a material to conduct a heat current. In particular, $\kappa$ is an important property that often dictates the usefulness of a material over a wide range of environmental conditions. For example, while a low $\kappa$ is desirable for the thermoelectric applications, a large $\kappa$ is needed when a material is used under the high temperature conditions. These materials range from common crystals to commodity amorphous polymers. The latter is of particular importance because of their use in designing light weight high performance functional materials. In this context, however, one of the major limitations of the amorphous polymers is their low $\kappa$, reaching a maximum value of about 0.4 W/Km that is 2--3 orders of magnitude smaller than the standard crystals. Moreover, when energy is predominantly transferred through the bonded connections, $\kappa \ge 100$ W/Km. Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to attain a tunability in $\kappa$ via macromolecular engineering. In this work, an overview of the recent results on the $\kappa$ behavior in polymers and polymeric solids is presented. In particular, computational and theoretical results are discussed within the context of complimentary experiments. Future directions are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Over 50 mA current in interdigitated diamond field effect transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents the bulk diamond field-effect transistor (FET) with the highest current value reported at this moment. The goal was to drastically increase the current of this type of device by increasing the total gate width thanks to an interdigitated architecture and homogeneous growth properties. We report the results obtained by fabricating and characterizing an interdigitated junction FET (JFET). The device develops a total gate width of 14.7 mm, with 24 paralleled fingers and a current higher than 50 mA at VDS = -15 V, VGS = 0 V, at 450 K and under illumination which is the highest value reported for a bulk diamond FET. Its specific ON-resistance and threshold voltage are respectively 608 m$\Omega$.cm${}^2$, 50 V. From Transfer length method (TLM) measurements we extract a resistivity of 3.6 m$\Omega$.cm for a heavily boron-doped (p++)-diamond layer and 1.52 $\Omega$.cm for a 2.1017 cm-3 p-doped diamond layer at 450 K. We measured the drain current versus gate voltage characteristics at high temperature showing that it is no longer the conduction channel resistance but the device access resistance that is predominant. This study indicates that it is possible to drastically improve the ON-state of FETs by using an interdigitated architecture, while using homogeneous large size diamond layers grown by CVD.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous hysteresis in local STM tunnel conductance with gate-voltage in single-layer MoS$_2$ on SiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomly distributed traps at the MoS$_2$/SiO$_2$ interface result in non-ideal transport behavior, including hysteresis in MoS$_2$/SiO$_2$ field effect transistors (FETs). Thus traps are mostly detrimental to the FET performance but they also offer some application potential. Our STM/S measurements on atomically resolved few-layer and single-layer MoS$_2$ on SiO$_2$ show n-doped behavior with the expected band gap close to 2.0 and 1.4 eV, respectively. The local tunnel conductance with gate-voltage $V_{\rm g}$ sweep exhibits a turn-on/off at a threshold $V_{\rm g}$ at which the tip's Fermi-energy nearly coincides with the local conduction band minimum. This threshold value is found to depend on $V_{\rm g}$ sweep direction amounting to local hysteresis. The hysteresis is, expectedly, found to depend on both the extent and rate of $V_{\rm g}$-sweep. Further, the spatial variation in the local $V_{\rm g}$ threshold and the details of tunnel conductance Vs $V_{\rm g}$ behavior indicate inhomogenieties in both the traps' density and their energy distribution. The latter even leads to the pinning of the local Fermi energy in some regions. Further, some rare locations exhibit a p-doping with both p and n-type $V_{\rm g}$-thresholds in local conductance and an unusual hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Superconductivity at 20 K in Th$_3$P$_4$-type In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ Synthesized by Diamond Anvil Cell with Boron-doped Diamond Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of superconductors in metastable phases by manipulating crystal structures through high-pressure techniques has attracted significant interest in materials science to achieve a high critical temperature ($T_c$). In this study, we report an emergence of novel superconductivity in a metastable phase of Th$_3$P$_4$-type cubic In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ with remarkably high $T_c$ at 20 K under 45 GPa by using an originally designed diamond anvil cell equipped with boron-doped diamond electrodes, which can perform a high-pressure synthesis and an in-situ electrical transport measurement simultaneously. In-situ structural analysis indicates that the In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ appears partially above 40 GPa without heating. The high-pressure annealing treatment induces complete transformation to the Th$_3$P$_4$-type structure, and the defected concentration of x in In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The $T_c$ in In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ is maximized at x = 0 and approaches 20 K. Electronic band calculations show that the high density of states composed of sulfur and indium bands are located at the conduction band bottom near Fermi energy. The record high $T_c$ in In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ among superconducting sulfides accelerates the further exploration of high $T_c$ materials within the Th$_3$P$_4$-type cubic family by using flexibility in crystal structure.</description>

      <title>Efficient prediction of potential energy surface and physical properties with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of machine learning methodologies for predicting properties within materials science has garnered significant attention. Among recent advancements, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). This study evaluates the impact of substituting MLPs with KANs within three established machine learning frameworks: Allegro, Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), and the Edge-Based Tensor Prediction Graph Neural Network (ETGNN). Our results demonstrate that the integration of KANs generally yields enhanced prediction accuracies. Specifically, replacing MLPs with KANs in the output blocks leads to notable improvements in accuracy and, in certain scenarios, also results in reduced training times. Furthermore, employing KANs exclusively in the output block facilitates faster inference and improved computational efficiency relative to utilizing KANs throughout the entire model. The selection of an optimal basis function for KANs is found to be contingent upon the particular problem at hand. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of KANs in enhancing machine learning potentials and material property predictions.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning large language models for domain adaptation: Exploration of training strategies, scaling, model merging and synergistic capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in fields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of fine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining (CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization approaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis shows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the merging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities that surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that model merging leads to new functionalities that neither parent model could achieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments. Experiments with different model architectures are presented, including Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral 7B models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring whether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with 1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature emergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be a key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a human and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how different model variants perform and show that the smallest model achieves a high intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth, creativity, clarity, and quantitative precision. Other experiments include the development of image generation prompts based on disparate biological material design concepts, to create new microstructures, architectural concepts, and urban design based on biological materials-inspired construction principles.</description>

      <title>Formation of high-aspect-ratio nanocavity in LiF crystal using a femtosecond of x-ray FEL pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-picosecond optical laser processing of metals is actively utilized for modification of a heated surface layer. But for deeper modification of different materials a laser in the hard x-ray range is required. Here, we demonstrate that a single 9-keV x-ray pulse from a free-electron laser can form a um-diameter cylindrical cavity with length of ~1 mm in LiF surrounded by shock-transformed material. The plasma-generated shock wave with TPa-level pressure results in damage, melting and polymorphic transformations of any material, including transparent and non-transparent to conventional optical lasers. Moreover, cylindrical shocks can be utilized to obtain a considerable amount of exotic high-pressure polymorphs. Pressure wave propagation in LiF, radial material flow, formation of cracks and voids are analyzed via continuum and atomistic simulations revealing a sequence of processes leading to the final structure with the long cavity. Similar results can be produced with semiconductors and ceramics, which opens a new pathway for development of laser material processing with hard x-ray pulses.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectroscopy study of kagome material CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome material CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is isostructural to the extensively studied charge density wave (CDW) compound CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, exhibits intriguing electronic features within its two-dimensional kagome lattices of titanium atoms. Here, we perform optical spectroscopic measurements together with the first-principles calculations on single-crystalline CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ to investigate its electronic properties comprehensively. It is found that the overall optical spectra are very similar to those of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but the existence of CDW instability is ruled out in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Via careful comparison to the optical responses of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we attribute this difference to a significant reduction in the itinerant carrier density of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is associated with the absence of van Hove singularity near the Fermi level at $M$ point. This result supports the scenario that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is driven by the nesting of van Hove singularity. Additionally, we unveil some exotic low-lying absorption features, which provide clear evidence of flat bands in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of exotic phenomena in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and provide valuable insights into the role of van Hove singularity in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing well-defined magnetic nanomaterials is crucial for various applications and demands a comprehensive understanding of their magnetic properties at the microscopic level. In this study, we investigate the contributions to the total anisotropy of Mn-Co mixed spinel nanoparticles. By employing neutron measurements sensitive to the spatially resolved surface anisotropy with sub-A resolution, we reveal the discrepancy between the excess anisotropy that can be explained by the shape anisotropy and interparticle interactions. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between chemical composition, microstructure, morphology, and surface effects and provide valuable insights for the design of advanced magnetic nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Digital Dark Field -- Higher Contrast and Greater Specificity Dark Field Imaging using a 4DSTEM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method for dark field imaging is introduced which uses scanned electron diffraction (or 4DSTEM - 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy) datasets as its input. Instead of working on simple summation of intensity, it works on a sparse representation of the diffraction patterns in terms of a list of their diffraction peaks. This is tested on a thin perovskite film containing structural ordering resulting in additional superlattice spots that reveal details of domain structures, and is shown to give much better selectivity and contrast than conventional virtual dark field imaging. It is also shown to work well in polycrystalline aggregates of CuO nanoparticles. In view of the higher contrast and selectivity, and the complete exclusion of diffuse scattering from the image formation, it is expected to be of significant benefit for characterisation of a wide variety of crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Electric field-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism in a time-reversal-odd antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal (T) symmetry (T-odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet-like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T-odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet-like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T-odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T symmetry in such a system, we employ a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E-induced NDD). We successfully detected signals of E-induced NDD in a T-odd antiferromagnet, Co2SiO4, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E-induced NDD, we visualized spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T operation. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. Our observation of E-induced NDD provides a unique approach to accessing the order parameter in T-odd antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Investigating Quantum Spin-Textures Using Universal MJ Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a pair of novel universal MJ spintronic models that precisely mirror the complex spin textures observed in spintronic materials. The spin-orbit coupled (SOC) Hamiltonians H_MJ1 and H_MJ2 reveal a range of novel and intriguing spin phenomena by modulating spin-orbit interactions. The Hamiltonian H_MJ1 reshapes the existing paradigm, providing a more robust and versatile framework than the Hamiltonian H_RD, with the potential to catalyze new advancements in the study of quantum materials. H_MJ1 encapsulates two distinct spin textures: a unidirectional, momentum-independent persistent spin texture (PST), and a bidirectional (partial) PST. In contrast Hamiltonian H_MJ2 portrays a spiral spin texture, drawing a conceptual link to the cosmological process of expansion and contraction, mirrored within a two-dimensional quantum framework. We also explore the fundamental aspects of earlier analytical models that underpin the construction of the present MJ spintronic model. The physical interpretations of these models are illustrated graphically, and the emerging spin phenomena resulting from complex SOC are elucidated using a simple vector model.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonlinear Rashba effect and spin Hall conductivity in Janus MXenes W2COX (X = S, Se, Te)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) facilitates spin manipulation without relying on an external magnetic field, opening up exciting possibilities for advanced spintronic devices. In this work, we examine the effects of crystal momentum ($k$) nonlinearity and anisotropy on the conventional Rashba effect, with a particular focus on their impact on the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) in a newly predicted family of 2D Janus materials, W$_2$COX (X = S, Se, Te). Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we confirm the dynamical and mechanical stability of the studied 2D materials. Strikingly, this materials family exhibits pronounced nonlinear Rashba spin splitting at the $\Gamma$ point of Brillouin zone near the Fermi level, which cannot be adequately described by the linear-$k$ Rashba model. Therefore, third-order momentum contributions ({$k^3$}) must be incorporated into the Rashba Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that among the studied systems, W$_2$COS exhibits the highest {$k^3$} contribution of $-45.9$\,eV\,{\AA$^3$}, despite having the lowest linear Rashba constant. A detailed analysis of electronic structure reveals topological nontrivial behaviour in these 2D materials, yielding sizable SHC that is primarily governed by the nonlinear Rashba effect. Notably, these materials also exhibit large spin Hall angle (0.018 -- 2.5), which is comparable to that of in bulk topological insulators like Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$, and surpassing those in narrow bandgap bulk semiconductors GeTe and SnTe, as well as heavy metals such as Pt. Sizable SHC, large spin Hall angles, and the ability to tune SHC via electric fields without altering the topological properties, rooted in the crystal field splitting, underscore the potential of these materials for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>The nature of low-temperature spin-freezing in frustrated Kitaev magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and spin correlations in frustrated Kitaev quantum materials offers an ideal platform to host non-trivial quantum states with exotic fractional excitations. The signature of spin-freezing behavior of these spin-orbit-driven frustrated magnets is characterized by a bifurcation of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures much below the characteristic interaction energy scale of spins. The temperature dependence of magnetic specific heat exhibits Cm~ T^2 dependence near the freezing temperature. The field-independent behavior of Cm below the freezing temperature implies the presence of exotic low-energy excitations. The aging and memory effect experiments in the Kitaev magnets suggest a non-hierarchical free energy distribution, which differs from the hierarchical organization of conventional spin-freezing. Furthermore, the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follows a power law behavior below the spin-freezing temperature, suggesting the persistence of unconventional spin excitation spectra. Herein, we demonstrate that the observed low-temperature spin-freezing phenomena in a few representative Kitaev quantum materials can be effectively explained by the Halperin and Saslow (HS) hydrodynamic modes relevant for non-trivial spin glass materials. The linearly dispersive HS modes are hypothesized to account for instigating non-abelian defect propagation, thereby inducing a spin jam state in the low-temperature regime in frustrated Kitaev magnets. Our investigation reveals that HS modes capture the essence of unconventional spin-freezing ascribed to topological origin in two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev magnets decorated on a honeycomb lattice and its 3D analog hyperhoneycomb that offers a viable ground to extend this framework to a large class of frustrated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of local $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers for finite and periodic two-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological phases of two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric insulators are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant. Usually, the invariant is introduced and calculated by exploiting the way time-reversal symmetry acts in reciprocal space, hence implicitly assuming periodicity and homogeneity. Here, we introduce two space-resolved $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers that are able to probe the local topology of the ground-state electronic structure also in the case of inhomogeneous and finite systems. The first approach leads to a generalized local spin-Chern marker, that usually remains well-defined also when the perpendicular component of the spin, $S_{z}$, is not conserved. The second marker is solely based on time-reversal symmetry, hence being more general. We validate our markers on the Kane-Mele model both in periodic and open boundary conditions, also in presence of disorder and including topological/trivial heterojunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 216401] we presented the multichannel Dyson equation (MCDE) in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. In this work we will give further details of the MCDE approach. In particular we will discuss: 1) the derivation of the MCDE and the definition of the space in which it is to be solved; 2) the rationale of the approximation to the multichannel self-energy; 3) a diagrammatic analysis of the MCDE; 4) the recasting of the MCDE on an eigenvalue problem with an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved using standard numerical techniques. This work mainly focuses on the coupling between the one-body Green's function and the three-body Green's function to describe photoemission spectra, but the MCDE method can be generalized to the coupling of other many-body Green's functions and to other spectroscopies.</description>

Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>

Abstract: In rare earth nickelates (RENiO$_3$), electron-lattice coupling drives a concurrent metal-to-insulator and bond disproportionation phase transition whose microscopic origin has long been the subject of active debate. Of several proposed mechanisms, here we test the hypothesis that pairs of self-doped ligand holes spatially condense to provide local spin moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to Ni spins. These singlet-like states provide a basis for long-range bond and spiral spin order. Using magnetic resonant X-ray scattering on NdNiO$_3$ thin films, we observe the chiral nature of the spin-disproportionated state, with spin spirals propagating along the crystallographic (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ direction. These spin spirals are found to preferentially couple to X-ray helicity, establishing the presence of a hitherto-unobserved macroscopic chirality. The presence of this chiral magnetic configuration suggests a potential multiferroic coupling between the noncollinear magnetic arrangement and improper ferroelectric behavior as observed in prior studies on NdNiO$_3$ (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ films and RENiO$_3$ single crystals. Experimentally constrained theoretical double-cluster calculations confirm the presence of an energetically stable spin-disproportionated state with Zhang-Rice singlet-like combinations of Ni and ligand moments.</description>

Abstract: Topological surface states are unique to topological materials and are immune to disturbances. In isostatic lattices, mechanical topological floppy modes exhibit softness depending on the polarization relative to the terminating surface. However, in three dimensions, the polarization of topological floppy modes is disrupted by the ubiquitous mechanical Weyl lines. Here, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases free of Weyl lines. Floppy modes emerge exclusively on a particular surface of the three-dimensional isostatic structure, leading to the strongly asymmetric stiffness between opposing boundaries. Additionally, uniform soft strains can reversibly shift the lattice configuration to Weyl phases, reducing the stiffness contrast to a trivially comparable level. Our work demonstrates the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases in three dimensions, and paves the way towards engineering soft and adaptive metamaterials.</description>
