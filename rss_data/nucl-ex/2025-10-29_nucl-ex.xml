      <title>Robust and Generalizable Background Subtraction on Images of Calorimeter Jets using Unsupervised Generative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate separation of signal from background is one of the main challenges for precision measurements across high-energy and nuclear physics. Conventional supervised learning methods are insufficient here because the required paired signal and background examples are impossible to acquire in real experiments. Here, we introduce an unsupervised unpaired image-to-image translation neural network that learns to separate the signal and background from the input experimental data using cycle-consistency principles. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using images composed of simulated calorimeter data from the sPHENIX experiment, where physics signals (jets) are immersed in the extremely dense and fluctuating heavy-ion collision environment. Our method outperforms conventional subtraction algorithms in fidelity and overcomes the limitations of supervised methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the model's robustness in an out-of-distribution test scenario designed to emulate modified jets as in real experimental data. The model, trained on a simpler dataset, maintained its high fidelity on a more realistic, highly modified jet signal. This work represents the first use of unsupervised unpaired generative models for full detector jet background subtraction and offers a path for novel applications in real experimental data, enabling high-precision analyses across a wide range of imaging-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Precise tracking spectroscopy of beta-gamma cascade in nuclear decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear $\beta$ decay, a sensitive probe of nuclear structure and weak interactions, has become a precision test bed for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), driven by recent advances in spectroscopic techniques. Here we introduce tracking spectroscopy of $\beta$-$\gamma$ cascades, a method that reconstructs decay vertices while simultaneously detecting $\beta$ particles and all associated de-excitation energies. Using the PandaX-4T detector operated as a tracking spectrometer, we obtain a precise and unbiased decay scheme of $^{214}$Pb, a key background isotope in searches for dark matter and Majorana neutrinos. For the first time, transitions of $^{214}$Pb to both the ground and excited states of $^{214}$Bi are measured concurrently, revealing discrepancies in branching ratios of up to 4.7$\sigma$ relative to previous evaluations. Combined with state-of-the-art theoretical spectral shape calculations, these results establish a new benchmark for background modeling in rare-event searches and highlight the potential of tracking spectroscopy as a versatile tool for fundamental physics and nuclear applications.</description>

      <title>Baryon and electric charge stoppings in nuclear collisions and the role of strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been challenging to quantitatively understand the stopping of incoming nucleons in nuclear collisions, and recently it has been proposed that comparing the baryon stopping with electric charge stopping can help address the question. Here we focus on the $B/Q\times Z/A$ ratio, which can strongly depend on rapidity although its value is one for the full phase space. We find that this ratio is very sensitive to the difference between strange and anti-strange rapidity distributions (the $s-\bar s$ asymmetry), and slightly more anti-strange quarks at mid-rapidity would lead to a ratio well below one. This is the case for Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru isobar collisions at $200A$ GeV from a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. Without the $s-\bar s$ asymmetry, the AMPT model would give a mid-rapidity $B/Q\times Z/A$ ratio at or above one. In addition, the AMPT model gives $B/\Delta Q\times \Delta Z/A&lt;1$ at mid-rapidity for isobar collisions at all centralities, which strongly contradicts the recent data from the STAR Collaboration. We further find that the $B/\Delta Q\times \Delta Z/A$ ratio is very sensitive to the net-light quark ($u,d$) stoppings, but it is less sensitive to the $s-\bar s$ asymmetry than the $B/Q\times Z/A$ ratio by a factor of 3.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Heavy QCD Axions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on heavy QCD axions. BBN offers a powerful probe of new physics that modifies the neutron-to-proton ratio during the process, thanks to the precisely measured primordial Helium-4 abundance. A heavy QCD axion provides an attractive target for this probe, because not only is it a well-motivated hypothetical particle by the strong CP problem, but also it dominantly decays to hadrons if kinematically allowed. A range of its lifetime is thus excluded where the hadronic decays would significantly alter the neutron-to-proton ratio. We compute axion-induced modification of the neutron-to-proton ratio, and obtain robust upper bounds on the axion lifetimes, as low as 0.017 s for the axion mass higher than 300 MeV. Remarkably, this is stronger than projected future CMB bounds via $N_{\rm eff}$. Our bounds are largely insensitive to uncertainties in hadronic cross sections and the axion's branching fractions into various hadrons, as well as to the precise value of the initial axion abundance. We also incorporate, for the first time, several key improvements, such as scattering processes by energetic $K_L$ and secondary hadrons, that can also be important for studying general hadronic injections during BBN, not limited to those from axion decays.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Constraints on Pion Valence Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profile of the pion valence quark distribution function (DF) remains controversial. Working from the concepts of QCD effective charges and generalised parton distributions, we show that since the pion elastic electromagnetic form factor is well approximated by a monopole, then, at large light-front momentum fraction, the pion valence quark DF is a convex function described by a large-$x$ power law that is practically consistent with expectations based on quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bell-Triplet State in Proton-Proton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information science, with profound implications for computing, communication, and metrology. Nuclear scattering processes, dominated by rich spin-dependent interactions, offer a natural platform for generating complex spin entanglement. Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees, with the spin amplitude a transition operator connecting two different Bell states. In contrast to the low-energy singlet state governed by the Pauli principle and the S-wave dominance, this second maximally entangled state is directly shaped by tensor forces beyond leading-order chiral effective field theory, providing a distinct quantum-information signature for realistic nuclear forces. These findings, invisible to traditional scattering observables, establish proton-proton scattering as a robust source of triplet entanglement and pave the way for next-generation nuclear Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Inclusion of Higher-order Ca$^+$ Isotope Shifts in the King's Plot Yields an Order Improvement on the $e^- - n$ Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By critically evaluating higher-order nonlinear effects to the isotope shifts (ISs) in the low-lying transition frequencies of the singly charged calcium ion, stringent constraint on the electron-neutron coupling due to a hypothetical boson describing physics beyond the Standard Model is inferred. It shows an order magnitude difference compared to the previously reported limit demonstrating importance of higher-order effects in the analysis of nonlinearity in the King's plot. The first-order IS parameters and enhancement factor ($D$) were evaluated using two complementary approaches in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework: namely finite-field (FF) and analytical response (AR) approaches. Extraction of the second-order IS parameters in the FF approach show numerical instabilities, so they are determined in the AR approach. Comparison of these factors with previous calculation shows substantial differences in the magnitudes. However, $D$ values from both the FF and AR approaches display excellent agreement. We also show explicitly roles of electron correlation effects in the evaluation of $D$ values accurately.</description>

      <title>Removal of spallation-induced tritium from silicon through diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tritium, predominantly produced through spallation reactions caused by cosmic ray interactions, is a significant radioactive background for silicon-based rare event detection experiments, such as dark matter searches. We have investigated the feasibility of removing cosmogenic tritium from high-purity silicon intended for use in low-background experiments. We demonstrate that significant tritium removal is possible through diffusion by subjecting silicon to high-temperature (&gt; 400C) baking. Using an analytical model for the de-trapping and diffusion of tritium in silicon, our measurements indicate that cosmogenic tritium diffusion constants are comparable to previous measurements of thermally-introduced tritium, with complete de-trapping and removal achievable above 750C. This approach has the potential to alleviate the stringent constraints of cosmic ray exposure prior to device fabrication and significantly reduce the cosmogenic tritium backgrounds of silicon-based detectors for next-generation rare event searches.</description>

      <title>Vertex reconstruction in the TAO experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a tonne-scale gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). It is designed to measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution, better than 2% at 1 MeV. To fully achieve its designed performance, precise vertex reconstruction is crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias&lt;5mm) and 12mm (bias&lt;1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO experiment. The reconstruction algorithms developed in this study not only prepare the TAO experiment for its upcoming real data but also hold significant potential for application in other similar experiments.</description>

      <title>Vector meson dominance in photon structure functions at small $x$ from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the photon structure functions via the photon-photon and photon-vector meson scattering within the framework of holographic QCD, focusing on the small Bjorken $x$ region and assuming that the Pomeron exchange dominates. The quasi-real photon structure functions are formulated as the convolution of the known U(1) vector field wave function with the Brower-Polchinski-Strassler-Tan (BPST) Pomeron exchange kernel in the five-dimensional AdS space. Assuming the vector meson dominance, the photon structure functions can be calculated in a different way with the BPST kernel and vector meson gravitational form factor, which can be obtained in a bottom-up AdS/QCD model, for the Pomeron-vector meson coupling. It is shown that the obtained $F_2$ structure functions in the both ways agree with the experimental data, which implies the realization of the vector meson dominance within the present model setup. Calculations for the longitudinal structure function and the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio are also presented.</description>

      <title>Collective effects in O-O and Ne-Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV from a hybrid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many features of heavy-ion collisions are well described by hybrid approaches, where the droplet of strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (QGP) is modeled by hydrodynamics and the subsequent dilute stage is performed with a hadronic transport model. Conventionally, the formation of a QGP is well established in larger collision systems like Lead and Gold. However, hints of collectivity were found even in proton-proton collisions, raising the question where the onset of QGP formation lays. This study aims at making predictions for the light ions run at the LHC in July 2025, in order to explore the applicability of hybrid approaches in smaller collision systems. We employ three different models, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid, the pure hadronic cascade of SMASH and Angantyr to simulate O-O collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV. This setup allows us to compare evolutions with and without a hydrodynamic description on an equal basis, while Angantyr serves as a baseline for no collective effects.</description>
