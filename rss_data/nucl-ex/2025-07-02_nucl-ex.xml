      <title>Analysis of spectral modification of $\phi$ mesons at finite density using a transport approach in the 12 GeV pA reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadron spectrum at finite density is an important observable for exploring the origin of hadron masses. In the KEK-PS E325 experiment, the di-electron decays of phi mesons inside and outside nuclei were measured using 12 GeV pA reactions. In the previous analysis, a significant excess was observed on the low-mass side of the phi meson peak in the data for slow-moving phi mesons ($\beta\gamma=p_{\phi}/m_{\phi}&lt;1.25$) with the Cu target, and in-medium vector meson spectral modification was verified. We newly employed the PHSD transport approach to take into account the time evolution of spatial density distribution of the target nuclei. Consistent with the previous analysis, a significant excess was observed in the present analysis as well. It was found that incorporating momentum dependence into the spectral modification leads to better agreement with the experimental results. For the slow-moving $\phi$ mesons with the Cu target, the newly obtained modification parameters are consistent with those from the previous analysis within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of rescattering effect on vector mesons spin alignment at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin alignment of vector mesons in heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe of quark polarization and hadronization mechanism in quark-gluon plasma. Hadronic rescattering may affect the measured spin alignment of vector mesons due to non-uniform rescattering probability in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Using the UrQMD model, we systematically investigated the hadronic rescattering effect on the measurement of $\rho_{00}$, the spin alignment parameter, for $K^{*0}$, $\phi$, and $\rho^{0}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV. Our results reveal that the measurable $\rho_{00} - 1/3$ remains unaffected for $\phi$, while shows significantly negative (positive) deviations for $K^{*0}$ and $\rho^0$ with respect to the reaction (production) plane. Quantitatively, the maximum deviation reaches $-0.0056$ ($0.0268$) for $K^{*0}$ and $-0.0122$ ($0.0414$) for $\rho^{0}$ with respect to the reaction (production) plane. Notably, the deviations in $\rho_{00}$ for both $K^{*0}$ and $\rho^{0}$ increase monotonically with increasing collision energy. These findings underscore the critical necessity of accounting for rescattering effects when interpreting spin alignment measurements of short-lived vector mesons in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Collectivity of rotational motion in $^{220}$Rn and $^{226}$Ra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations to reconstruct rotational level patterns in the $^{220}$Rn and $^{226}$Ra nuclei have been performed using a collective quadrupole+octupole approach with microscopic mass tensor and moments of inertia dependent on deformation and pairing degrees of freedom. The main objective is to quantitatively confirm the known experimental observations that the Rn nucleus passes from octupole vibrational to octupole deformed with increasing rotation frequency, while the Ra nucleus is relatively weakly affected by collective rotation, being octupole deformed from the beginning. The collective potential in a nine-dimensional collective space is determined using the macroscopic-microscopic method with Strutinsky and the BCS with an approximate particle number projection microscopic corrections. The corresponding Hamiltonian is diagonalized based on the projected solutions of the harmonic oscillators coupled with Wigner functions. Such an orthogonalized basis is additionally symmetrized with respect to the so-called intrinsic symmetrization group, specifically dedicated to the collective space used, to ensure the uniqueness of the Hamiltonian eigen-solutions in the laboratory frame. The response of the pairing and deformation degrees of freedom to external rotation is discussed in the variational approach, where the total energy is minimized by the deformation and pairing variables. Consequently, the corresponding microscopic moments of inertia increase with collective spin (Coriolis {\it antiparing} effect), resulting in effectively lower rotational energy levels I$^{\pi}$ with respect to pure classical-rotor pattern I(I+1). The obtained comparison of experimental and theoretical rotational energy level schemes, dipole, quadrupole and octupole transition probabilities of B(E$\lambda$) in $^{220}$Rn and $^{226}$Ra is satisfactory.</description>

      <title>Interplay of prompt and non-prompt photons in photon-triggered jet observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt photons are important yet challenging to observe in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are produced in the early stages and traverse almost the entire QGP medium without interaction. Experimental analyses typically employ isolation cuts, in the hope to identify prompt photons. Most theoretical studies consider only events with actual prompt photons, assuming no contribution from isolated non-prompt photons to reduce computational cost. For the first time, we present a study that compares simulation results generated using inclusive (bremsstrahlung) and prompt-photon events with multiple experimental observables for both $p-p$ and $Pb-Pb$ collisions at $5.02$ TeV. Simulations are carried out using the multi-stage JETSCAPE framework tuned to describe the quenching of jets and hadrons. Isolated non-prompt photons are generated in hard photon bremsstrahlung, where the photon is radiated at a sufficient angle to the jet. Several photon triggered jet and jet substructure observables show significant contributions from inclusive photons, yielding an improvement in comparison with experimental data. Novel photon triggered jet substructure observables are also expected to show new structures, yet to be detected in experiment. This effort examines the significance of isolated non-prompt photons using parameters tuned for a simultaneous description of the leading hadron and jet spectrum, and thus provides an independent verification of the multistage evolution framework.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF and scale uncertainties cancel dramatically while showing little sensitivity to parton shower and hadronization models, addressing a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>

      <title>Primary activity measurement of an Am-241 solution using microgram inkjet gravimetry and decay energy spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for radionuclide assay that is spectroscopic with 100 % counting efficiency for alpha decay. Advancing both cryogenic decay energy spectrometry (DES) and drop-on-demand inkjet metrology, a solution of Am-241 was assayed for massic activity (of order 100 kBq/g) with a relative combined standard uncertainty less than 1 %. We implement live-timed counting, spectroscopic analysis, validation by liquid scintillation (LS) counting, and confirmation of quantitative solution transfer. Experimental DES spectra are well modeled with a Monte Carlo simulation. The model was further used to simulate Pu-238 and Pu-240 impurities, calculate detection limits, and demonstrate the potential for tracer-free multi-nuclide analysis, which will be valuable for new cancer therapeutics based on decay chains, Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) containing impurities, and more widely in nuclear energy, environmental monitoring, security, and forensics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3\% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve analysis performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Physics at BRIF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility (BRIF), which is based on Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) technique, consists of a 100 MeV proton cyclotron as the driving accelerator, a two-stage ISOL system for ion separation, a 13-MV tandem accelerator for post-acceleration, a superconducting linac for further boosting beam energies. It is capable of providing ISOL beams in the energy range from 60 to 300 keV, and post-accelerated beams in the energy range from 3 to 10 MeV/u for nuclei with mass numbers of A &lt; 80 by Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) technique. For nuclei with A up to 170, energies are still able to reach 3 MeV/u. This facility offers opportunities to address key questions of current interest in nuclear astrophysics, nuclear structure and reactions of unstable nuclei. In this review we present a comprehensive introduction to the BRIF and the typical experimental instruments installed on it, and then summarize current experimental results on unstable Na and Rb isotopes and future plan for further development of the BRIF to improve its performance.</description>

      <title>Magneto-$\nu$: Heavy neutral lepton search using $^{241}$Pu $\beta^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental $^{241}$Pu $\beta$ decay spectra as part of the Magneto-$\nu$ experiment aimed at searching for keV heavy neutral leptons (HNLs). A total of 200 million $\beta$ decays are measured by metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs), representing the highest statistical precision achieved for $^{241}$Pu to date. The end-point energy of $^{241}$Pu $\beta$ decay is measured with respect to external $^{133}$Ba, generating a value of 22.04\,(2)\,keV. The differential decay rate of the first forbidden nonunique transition of $^{241}$ Pu is described with a quadratic shape correction factor $C(w) = 1 - 1.928w + 0.937w^2$. Using a fraction of the high-statistics spectra, we set an upper limit on the admixture of a 10.5\,keV sterile neutrino to the electron neutrino at $|U_{e4}|^2 &lt; 1.23 \times 10^{-3}$ for HNL mass of 10.5\,keV.</description>
