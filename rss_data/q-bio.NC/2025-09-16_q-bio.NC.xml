      <title>Biomarkers of brain diseases</title>

Abstract: Despite the diversity of brain data acquired and advanced AI-based algorithms to analyze them, brain features are rarely used in clinics for diagnosis and prognosis. Here we argue that the field continues to rely on cohort comparisons to seek biomarkers, despite the well-established degeneracy of brain features. Using a thought experiment, we show that more data and more powerful algorithms will not be sufficient to identify biomarkers of brain diseases. We argue that instead of comparing patient versus healthy controls using single data type, we should use multimodal (e.g. brain activity, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, brain imaging) and longitudinal brain data to guide the grouping before defining multidimensional biomarkers for brain diseases.</description>

      <title>How Easterners and Westerners perceive ADHD differently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder has traditionally been conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental condition associated with deficits such as inattention, impulsivity, and poor time management. Such perspectives often emphasize pathology and functional limitations. More recent scholarship, however, has begun to reconceptualize ADHD by identifying potential adaptive characteristics, including heightened energy, periods of hyperfocus, and advanced cognitive flexibility. A growing body of qualitative research also examines self reported experiences of high functioning individuals with ADHD, highlighting positive traits and successful coping strategies. Despite these developments, the majority of existing studies remain concentrated in Western contexts, particularly the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Canada. This review seeks to address this imbalance by analyzing literature on ADHD strengths in Europe and North America alongside emerging studies from Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore.</description>

      <title>Trial-Level Time-frequency EEG Desynchronization as a Neural Marker of Pain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pain remains one of the most pressing health challenges, yet its measurement still relies heavily on self-report, limiting monitoring in non-communicative patients and hindering translational research. Neural oscillations recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) provide a promising avenue for identifying reproducible markers of nociceptive processing. Prior studies have reported pain-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha and beta bands, but most rely on trial-averaging, obscuring variability that may be critical for perception. We analyzed high-density EEG from 59 healthy participants who underwent electrical stimulation under Pain and No-Pain conditions. Per-trial time-frequency decomposition revealed robust beta-band ERD in frontal-central electrodes that differentiated Pain from No-Pain trials. Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that ERD scaled with subjective intensity ratings (VAS), and that age and gender moderated this relationship. Reverse models further showed that ERD predicted VAS ratings across participants, underscoring its potential as a nonverbal marker of pain. These findings provide preliminary evidence that trial-level EEG oscillations can serve as reliable indicators of pain and open avenues for individualized, report-free pain monitoring. Future work should validate these results in patient populations and extend analyses to multimodal approaches combining EEG, MRI, and attention-based modulation strategies.</description>

      <title>HiLWS: A Human-in-the-Loop Weak Supervision Framework for Curating Clinical and Home Video Data for Neurological Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based assessment of motor symptoms in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) offers a scalable alternative to in-clinic evaluations, but home-recorded videos introduce significant challenges, including visual degradation, inconsistent task execution, annotation noise, and domain shifts. We present HiLWS, a cascaded human-in-the-loop weak supervision framework for curating and annotating hand motor task videos from both clinical and home settings. Unlike conventional single-stage weak supervision methods, HiLWS employs a novel cascaded approach, first applies weak supervision to aggregate expert-provided annotations into probabilistic labels, which are then used to train machine learning models. Model predictions, combined with expert input, are subsequently refined through a second stage of weak supervision. The complete pipeline includes quality filtering, optimized pose estimation, and task-specific segment extraction, complemented by context-sensitive evaluation metrics that assess both visual fidelity and clinical relevance by prioritizing ambiguous cases for expert review. Our findings reveal key failure modes in home recorded data and emphasize the importance of context-sensitive curation strategies for robust medical video analysis.</description>

      <title>On a Geometry of Interbrain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.</description>

      <title>Causal Emergence of Consciousness through Learned Multiscale Neural Dynamics in Mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consciousness spans macroscopic experience and microscopic neuronal activity, yet linking these scales remains challenging. Prevailing theories, such as Integrated Information Theory, focus on a single scale, overlooking how causal power and its dynamics unfold across scales. Progress is constrained by scarce cross-scale data and difficulties in quantifying multiscale causality and dynamics. Here, we present a machine learning framework that infers multiscale causal variables and their dynamics from near-cellular-resolution calcium imaging in the mouse dorsal cortex. At lower levels, variables primarily aggregate input-driven information, whereas at higher levels they realize causality through metastable or saddle-point dynamics during wakefulness, collapsing into localized, stochastic dynamics under anesthesia. A one-dimensional top-level conscious variable captures the majority of causal power, yet variables across other scales also contribute substantially, giving rise to high emergent complexity in the conscious state. Together, these findings provide a multiscale causal framework that links neural activity to conscious states.</description>

      <title>Residual Gaze Behavior During Navigation in Blindness and Low Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Outdoor navigation poses significant challenges for people with blindness or low vision, yet the role of gaze behavior in supporting mobility remains underexplored. Fully sighted individuals typically adopt consistent scanning strategies, whereas those with visual impairments rely on heterogeneous adaptations shaped by residual vision and experience.
  Methods: We conducted a comparative eye-tracking study of fully sighted, low vision, blind, and fully blind participants navigating outdoor routes. Using a wearable eye tracker, we quantified fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation area, direction, peak fixation location, and walking speed.
  Results: Walking speed declined systematically with worsening vision. Fixation count increased with greater impairment, reflecting slower travel times and more frequent sampling. Fixation rate rose with worsening vision, though between-group differences were generally not significant between most groups. Fixation spatial coverage decreased along the continuum of vision loss. Fixation patterns were most consistent in the fully sighted group. Peak fixation locations were centered in fully sighted participants but shifted outward and became more variable with impairment.
  Conclusion: Gaze strategies during navigation form a graded continuum across vision groups, with fully sighted and fully blind participants at opposite poles and low vision and blind groups spanning the middle. Visual acuity alone does not predict functional gaze use, as rehabilitation experience and adaptive strategies strongly shape behavior. These findings highlight the need for personalized rehabilitation and assistive technologies, with residual gaze patterns offering insight into mobility capacity and training opportunities for safer navigation.</description>

      <title>Representational drift under spontaneous activity -- self-organized criticality enhances representational reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural systems face the challenge of maintaining reliable representations amid variations from plasticity and spontaneous activity. In particular, the spontaneous dynamics in neuronal circuit is known to operate near a highly variable critical state, which intuitively contrasts with the requirement of reliable representation. It is intriguing to understand how reliable representation could be maintained or even enhanced by critical spontaneous states. We firstly examined the co-existence of the scale-free avalanche in the spontaneous activity of mouse visual cortex with restricted representational geometry manifesting representational reliability amid the representational drift with respect to the visual stimulus. To explore how critical spontaneous state influences the neural representation, we built an excitation-inhibition network with homeostatic plasticity, which self-organizes to the critical spontaneous state. This model successfully reproduced both representational drift and restricted representational geometry observed experimentally, in contrast with randomly shuffled plasticity which causes accumulated drift of representational geometry. We further showed that the self-organized critical state enhances the cross-session low-dimensional representation, comparing to the non-critical state, by restricting the synapse weight into a low variation space. Our findings suggest that spontaneous self-organized criticality serves not only as a ubiquitous property of neural systems but also as a functional mechanism for maintaining reliable information representation under continuously changing networks, providing a potential explanation how the brain maintains consistent perception and behavior despite ongoing synaptic rewiring.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a study involving 87 participants exposed to a stressful scenario in a virtual reality (VR) environment. An algorithm was developed to assign a positive or negative valence based on questionnaire responses. EEG signals were recorded, and a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm was trained to infer emotional valence from these signals. Our objective is to further develop mathematical models capable of describing the dynamic evolution of emotional and mental states.</description>

      <title>Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding the activity of the nervous system is a critical challenge in neuroscience and neural interfacing. In this study, we present a neuromuscular recording system that enables large-scale sampling of muscle activity using microelectrode arrays with over 100 channels embedded in forearm muscles. These arrays captured intramuscular high-density signals that were decoded into patterns of activation of spinal motoneurons. In two healthy participants, we recorded high-density intramuscular activity during single- and multi-digit contractions, revealing distinct motoneuron recruitment patterns specific to each task. Based on these patterns, we achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) for 12 single- and multi-digit tasks and over 96% accuracy for up to 16 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art EMG classification methods. This intramuscular high-density system and classification method represent an advancement in neural interfacing, with the potential to improve human-computer interaction and the control of assistive technologies, particularly for replacing or restoring impaired motor function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural systems operate near a phase transition, optimizing the processing of information. While scale invariance and non-Gaussian dynamics--hallmarks of criticality--have been observed in brain activity, a direct link between criticality and behavioral performance remains unexplored. Here, we use a phenomenological renormalization group approach to examine neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of mice performing a visual recognition task. We show that nontrivial scaling in neuronal activity is associated with enhanced task performance, with pronounced scaling observed during successful task completion. When rewards were removed or non-natural stimuli presented, scaling signatures diminished. These results suggest that critical dynamics in the brain is crucial for optimizing behavioral outcomes, offering new insights into the functional role of criticality in cortical processing.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Representational Similarity Measures from the Lens of Functional Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</description>

      <title>Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. Memory is stored as statistics organized into structures that are repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Repeated summarization requires an intensive ongoing process guided by heuristics that help optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are progressively elaborated into more abstract constructs. This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by its emphasis on a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive, its reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, and the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.</description>

Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence as an Opportunity for the Science of Consciousness: A Dual-Resolution Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The encounter of artificial intelligence with consciousness research is often framed as a challenge: could this science determine whether such systems are conscious? We suggest it is equally an opportunity to expand and test the scope of existing theories of consciousness. Current approaches remain polarized. Computational functionalism emphasizes abstract organization, often realized through neural correlates of consciousness, while biological naturalism insists that consciousness is tied to living embodiment. Both positions risk anthropocentrism and limit the possibility of recognizing non-biological forms of subjectivity. To move beyond this impasse, we propose a dual-resolution framework that defines the ontological and epistemic conditions for consciousness. This approach combines the Information Theory of Individuality, which defines the ontological conditions of informational autonomy and self-maintenance, with the Moment-to-Moment theory, which specifies the epistemic conditions of temporal updating and phenomenological unfolding. This integration reframes consciousness as the epistemic expression of individuated systems in substrate-independent informational terms, offering a generalizable theory of consciousness and positioning AI as a promising testbed for its emergence.</description>

      <title>Plastic Arbor: a modern simulation framework for synaptic plasticity -- from single synapses to networks of morphological neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems. In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to support simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the extended framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that Arbor is highly efficient in terms of runtime and memory use as compared to other simulators. Using the extended framework, as an example, we investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, finding a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information. By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.</description>

      <title>Simplified derivations for high-dimensional convex learning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01110v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. Here, we give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. In particular, using a cavity approach, we analyze three high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. Furthermore, for perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naive method.</description>
