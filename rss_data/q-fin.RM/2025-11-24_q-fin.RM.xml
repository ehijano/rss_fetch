      <title>Optimal risk mitigation by deep reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\'er-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Analyzing distortion riskmetrics and weighted entropy for unimodal and symmetric distributions under partial information constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the lower and upper bounds of worst-case distortion riskmetrics and weighted entropy for unimodal, and symmetric unimodal distributions when mean and variance information are available. We also consider the sharp upper bounds of distortion riskmetrics and weighted entropy for symmetric distribution under known mean and variance. These results are applied to (weighted) entropies, shortfalls and other risk measures. Specifically, entropies include cumulative Tsallis past entropy, cumulative residual Tsallis entropy of order {\alpha}, extended Gini coefficient, fractional generalized cumulative residual entropy, and fractional generalized cumulative entropy. Shortfalls include extended Gini shortfall, Gini shortfall, shortfall of cumulative residual entropy, and shortfall of cumulative residual Tsallis entropy. Other risk measures include nth-order expected shortfall, dual power principle and proportional hazard principle.</description>

      <title>Can Nash inform capital requirements? Allocating systemic risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systemic risk measures aggregate the risks from multiple financial institutions to find system-wide capital requirements. Though much attention has been given to assessing the level of systemic risk, less has been given to allocating that risk to the constituent institutions. Within this work, we propose a Nash allocation rule that is inspired by game theory. Intuitively, to construct these capital allocations, the banks compete in a game to reduce their own capital requirements while, simultaneously, maintaining system-level acceptability. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Nash allocation rules, and apply our results to the prominent structures used for systemic risk measures in the literature. We demonstrate the efficacy of Nash allocations with numerical case studies using the Eisenberg-Noe aggregation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessment of Wildland-Urban Interface Fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fires represent a compound disaster resulting from the interactions between natural ecosystems and human settlements, characterized by significantly dynamic evolving risks. However, most current risk assessment studies are based on static frameworks, which struggle to effectively capture the dynamic changes in risk over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes an innovative method that integrates a dynamic evaluation matrix, grey incidence analysis, and an optimization model for the dynamic risk assessment of WUI fires. This method incorporates time-series data by constructing a dynamic evaluation matrix, subsequently calculates the weighted standardized matrix for each evaluated area and its local volume matrices relative to the positive and negative ideal matrices. The dynamic differences between the evaluated areas and the ideal state are quantified by calculating the grey incidence degree, and an optimization model is established to solve for the superiority degree used for risk ranking. Research demonstrates that this method not only simplifies the computational process but also effectively captures the dynamic evolution patterns of fire risk across different areas, enabling refined risk classification. Compared to existing static methods, this framework overcomes their limitation in adequately representing risk dynamics, providing a more scientific basis for decision-making in the dynamic management and proactive prevention and control of WUI fires.</description>
