      <title>Perspectives: Comparison of Deep Learning Segmentation Models on Biophysical and Biomedical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning based approaches are now widely used across biophysics to help automate a variety of tasks including image segmentation, feature selection, and deconvolution. However, the presence of multiple competing deep learning architectures, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, makes it challenging to select an architecture best suited for a specific application. As such, we present a comprehensive comparison of common models. Here, we focus on the task of segmentation assuming the typically small training dataset sizes available from biophysics experiments and compare the following four commonly used architectures: convolutional neural networks, U-Nets, vision transformers, and vision state space models. In doing so, we establish criteria for determining optimal conditions under which each model excels, thereby offering practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>A Novel Generative Artificial Intelligence Method for Interference Study on Multiplex Brightfield Immunohistochemistry Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplex brightfield imaging offers the advantage of simultaneously analyzing multiple biomarkers on a single slide, as opposed to single biomarker labeling on multiple consecutive slides. To accurately analyze multiple biomarkers localized at the same cellular compartment, two representative biomarker sets were selected as assay models - cMET-PDL1-EGFR and CD8-LAG3-PDL1, where all three biomarkers can co-localize on the cell membrane. One of the most crucial preliminary stages for analyzing such assay is identifying each unique chromogen on individual cells. This is a challenging problem due to the co-localization of membrane stains from all the three biomarkers. It requires advanced color unmixing for creating the equivalent singleplex images from each triplex image for each biomarker.
  In this project, we developed a cycle-Generative Adversarial Network (cycle-GAN) method for unmixing the triplex images generated from the above-mentioned assays. Three different models were designed to generate the singleplex image for each of the three stains Tamra (purple), QM-Dabsyl (yellow) and Green. A notable novelty of our approach was that the input to the network were images in the optical density domain instead of conventionally used RGB images. The use of the optical density domain helped in reducing the blurriness of the synthetic singleplex images, which was often observed when the network was trained on RGB images.
  The cycle-GAN models were validated on 10,800 lung, gastric and colon images for the cMET-PDL1-EGFR assay and 3600 colon images for the CD8-LAG3-PDL1 assay. Visual as well as quantified assessments demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and efficient when compared with the manual reviewing results and is readily applicable to various multiplex assays.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Denoising and Detection for Enhanced Intracellular Particle Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable analysis of intracellular dynamic processes in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images requires complete and accurate tracking of all small particles in all time frames of the image sequences. A fundamental first step towards this goal is particle detection. Given the small size of the particles, their detection is greatly affected by image noise. Recent studies have shown that applying image denoising as a preprocessing step indeed improves particle detection and their subsequent tracking. Deep learning based particle detection methods have shown superior results compared to traditional detection methods. However, they do not explicitly aim to remove noise from the images to facilitate detection. Thus we hypothesize that their performance could be further improved. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called DENODET (denoising-detection network), which performs image denoising and particle detection simultaneously. We show that integrative denoising and detection yields more accurate detection results. Our method achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art particle detection methods on the particle tracking challenge dataset and our own real fluorescence microscopy image data.</description>

      <title>MobileMEF: Fast and Efficient Method for Multi-Exposure Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in camera design and imaging technology have enabled the capture of high-quality images using smartphones. However, due to the limited dynamic range of digital cameras, the quality of photographs captured in environments with highly imbalanced lighting often results in poor-quality images. To address this issue, most devices capture multi-exposure frames and then use some multi-exposure fusion method to merge those frames into a final fused image. Nevertheless, most traditional and current deep learning approaches are unsuitable for real-time applications on mobile devices due to their heavy computational and memory requirements. We propose a new method for multi-exposure fusion based on an encoder-decoder deep learning architecture with efficient building blocks tailored for mobile devices. This efficient design makes our model capable of processing 4K resolution images in less than 2 seconds on mid-range smartphones. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding full-reference quality measures and computational efficiency (runtime and memory usage), making it ideal for real-time applications on hardware-constrained devices. Our code is available at: https://github.com/LucasKirsten/MobileMEF.</description>

      <title>Conditional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for VHR SAR to Optical Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. To deal with this challenge, research has been conducted on translating SAR images into optical-like representations to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Model (CDM) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</description>

      <title>PI-Att: Topology Attention for Segmentation Networks through Adaptive Persistence Image Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting multiple objects (e.g., organs) in medical images often requires an understanding of their topology, which simultaneously quantifies the shape of the objects and their positions relative to each other. This understanding is important for segmentation networks to generalize better with limited training data, which is common in medical image analysis. However, many popular networks were trained to optimize only pixel-wise performance, ignoring the topological correctness of the segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a new topology-aware loss function, which we call PI-Att, that explicitly forces the network to minimize the topological dissimilarity between the ground truth and prediction maps. We quantify the topology of each map by the persistence image representation, for the first time in the context of a segmentation network loss. Besides, we propose a new mechanism to adaptively calculate the persistence image at the end of each epoch based on the network's performance. This adaptive calculation enables the network to learn topology outline in the first epochs, and then topology details towards the end of training. The effectiveness of the proposed PI-Att loss is demonstrated on two different datasets for aorta and great vessel segmentation in computed tomography images.</description>

      <title>Learned denoising with simulated and experimental low-dose CT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like in many other research fields, recent developments in computational imaging have focused on developing machine learning (ML) approaches to tackle its main challenges. To improve the performance of computational imaging algorithms, machine learning methods are used for image processing tasks such as noise reduction. Generally, these ML methods heavily rely on the availability of high-quality data on which they are trained. This work explores the application of ML methods, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in the context of noise reduction for computed tomography (CT) imaging. We utilize a large 2D computed tomography dataset for machine learning to carry out for the first time a comprehensive study on the differences between the observed performances of algorithms trained on simulated noisy data and on real-world experimental noisy data. The study compares the performance of two common CNN architectures, U-Net and MSD-Net, that are trained and evaluated on both simulated and experimental noisy data. The results show that while sinogram denoising performed better with simulated noisy data if evaluated in the sinogram domain, the performance did not carry over to the reconstruction domain where training on experimental noisy data shows a higher performance in denoising experimental noisy data. Training the algorithms in an end-to-end fashion from sinogram to reconstruction significantly improved model performance, emphasizing the importance of matching raw measurement data to high-quality CT reconstructions. The study furthermore suggests the need for more sophisticated noise simulation approaches to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data in CT image denoising applications and gives insights into the challenges and opportunities in leveraging simulated data for machine learning in computational imaging.</description>

      <title>Learned Multimodal Compression for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving sensors generate an enormous amount of data. In this paper, we explore learned multimodal compression for autonomous driving, specifically targeted at 3D object detection. We focus on camera and LiDAR modalities and explore several coding approaches. One approach involves joint coding of fused modalities, while others involve coding one modality first, followed by conditional coding of the other modality. We evaluate the performance of these coding schemes on the nuScenes dataset. Our experimental results indicate that joint coding of fused modalities yields better results compared to the alternatives.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Medical Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI: An Image Quality Assessment Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those leveraging autoencoders, have been widely adopted to perform anomaly detection in brain MRI. While most existing works try to improve detection accuracy by proposing new model structures or algorithms, we tackle the problem through image quality assessment, an underexplored perspective in the field. We propose a fusion quality loss function that combines Structural Similarity Index Measure loss with l1 loss, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a data pre-processing strategy that enhances the average intensity ratio (AIR) between normal and abnormal regions, further improving the distinction of anomalies. By fusing the aforementioned two methods, we devise the image quality assessment (IQA) approach. The proposed IQA approach achieves significant improvements (&gt;10%) in terms of Dice coefficient (DICE) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) on the BraTS21 (T2, FLAIR) and MSULB datasets when compared with state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the importance of invoking the comprehensive image quality assessment in medical anomaly detection and provide a new perspective for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Image-Aware Generative Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose in this paper an analytically new construct of a diffusion model whose drift and diffusion parameters yield an exponentially time-decaying Signal to Noise Ratio in the forward process. In reverse, the construct cleverly carries out the learning of the diffusion coefficients on the structure of clean images using an autoencoder. The proposed methodology significantly accelerates the diffusion process, reducing the required diffusion time steps from around 1000 seen in conventional models to 200-500 without compromising image quality in the reverse-time diffusion. In a departure from conventional models which typically use time-consuming multiple runs, we introduce a parallel data-driven model to generate a reverse-time diffusion trajectory in a single run of the model. The resulting collective block-sequential generative model eliminates the need for MCMC-based sub-sampling correction for safeguarding and improving image quality, to further improve the acceleration of image generation. Collectively, these advancements yield a generative model that is an order of magnitude faster than conventional approaches, while maintaining high fidelity and diversity in generated images, hence promising widespread applicability in rapid image synthesis tasks.</description>

      <title>Learned Single-Pass Multitasking Perceptual Graphics for Immersive Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive displays are advancing rapidly in terms of delivering perceptually realistic images by utilizing emerging perceptual graphics methods such as foveated rendering. In practice, multiple such methods need to be performed sequentially for enhanced perceived quality. However, the limited power and computational resources of the devices that drive immersive displays make it challenging to deploy multiple perceptual models simultaneously.
  We address this challenge by proposing a computationally-lightweight, text-guided, learned multitasking perceptual graphics model. Given RGB input images, our model outputs perceptually enhanced images by performing one or more perceptual tasks described by the provided text prompts. Our model supports a variety of perceptual tasks, including foveated rendering, dynamic range enhancement, image denoising, and chromostereopsis, through multitask learning. Uniquely, a single inference step of our model supports different permutations of these perceptual tasks at different prompted rates (i.e., mildly, lightly), eliminating the need for daisy-chaining multiple models to get the desired perceptual effect. We train our model on our new dataset of source and perceptually enhanced images, and their corresponding text prompts. We evaluate our model's performance on embedded platforms and validate the perceptual quality of our model through a user study. Our method achieves on-par quality with the state-of-the-art task-specific methods using a single inference step, while offering faster inference speeds and flexibility to blend effects at various intensities.</description>

      <title>Surgical SAM 2: Real-time Segment Anything in Surgical Video by Efficient Frame Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM-2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM-2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM-2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM-2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a feasible reality.</description>

      <title>Snuffy: Efficient Whole Slide Image Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce \textbf{\textit{Snuffy}} architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies.

      <title>Enhancing chest X-ray datasets with privacy-preserving large language models and multi-type annotations: a data-driven approach for improved classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis, rule-based systems are usually employed to extract labels from reports for dataset releases. However, there is still room for improvement in label quality. These labelers typically output only presence labels, sometimes with binary uncertainty indicators, which limits their usefulness. Supervised deep learning models have also been developed for report labeling but lack adaptability, similar to rule-based systems. In this work, we present MAPLEZ (Medical report Annotations with Privacy-preserving Large language model using Expeditious Zero shot answers), a novel approach leveraging a locally executable Large Language Model (LLM) to extract and enhance findings labels on CXR reports. MAPLEZ extracts not only binary labels indicating the presence or absence of a finding but also the location, severity, and radiologists' uncertainty about the finding. Over eight abnormalities from five test sets, we show that our method can extract these annotations with an increase of 3.6 percentage points (pp) in macro F1 score for categorical presence annotations and more than 20 pp increase in F1 score for the location annotations over competing labelers. Additionally, using the combination of improved annotations and multi-type annotations in classification supervision, we demonstrate substantial advancements in model quality, with an increase of 1.1 pp in AUROC over models trained with annotations from the best alternative approach. We share code and annotations.</description>

      <title>AMAES: Augmented Masked Autoencoder Pretraining on Public Brain MRI Data for 3D-Native Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of self-supervised pretraining of 3D semantic segmentation models on a large-scale, domain-specific dataset. We introduce BRAINS-45K, a dataset of 44,756 brain MRI volumes from public sources, the largest public dataset available, and revisit a number of design choices for pretraining modern segmentation architectures by simplifying and optimizing state-of-the-art methods, and combining them with a novel augmentation strategy. The resulting AMAES framework is based on masked-image-modeling and intensity-based augmentation reversal and balances memory usage, runtime, and finetuning performance. Using the popular U-Net and the recent MedNeXt architecture as backbones, we evaluate the effect of pretraining on three challenging downstream tasks, covering single-sequence, low-resource settings, and out-of-domain generalization. The results highlight that pretraining on the proposed dataset with AMAES significantly improves segmentation performance in the majority of evaluated cases, and that it is beneficial to pretrain the model with augmentations, despite pretraing on a large-scale dataset. Code and model checkpoints for reproducing results, as well as the BRAINS-45K dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/asbjrnmunk/amaes}.</description>

      <title>Few Shot Class Incremental Learning using Vision-Language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01040</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated remarkable performance comparable to human capabilities across various supervised computer vision tasks. However, the prevalent assumption of having an extensive pool of training data encompassing all classes prior to model training often diverges from real-world scenarios, where limited data availability for novel classes is the norm. The challenge emerges in seamlessly integrating new classes with few samples into the training data, demanding the model to adeptly accommodate these additions without compromising its performance on base classes. To address this exigency, the research community has introduced several solutions under the realm of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL).
  In this study, we introduce an innovative FSCIL framework that utilizes language regularizer and subspace regularizer. During base training, the language regularizer helps incorporate semantic information extracted from a Vision-Language model. The subspace regularizer helps in facilitating the model's acquisition of nuanced connections between image and text semantics inherent to base classes during incremental training. Our proposed framework not only empowers the model to embrace novel classes with limited data, but also ensures the preservation of performance on base classes. To substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three distinct FSCIL benchmarks, where our framework attains state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>DIffSteISR: Harnessing Diffusion Prior for Superior Real-world Stereo Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiffSteISR, a pioneering framework for reconstructing real-world stereo images. DiffSteISR utilizes the powerful prior knowledge embedded in pre-trained text-to-image model to efficiently recover the lost texture details in low-resolution stereo images. Specifically, DiffSteISR implements a time-aware stereo cross attention with temperature adapter (TASCATA) to guide the diffusion process, ensuring that the generated left and right views exhibit high texture consistency thereby reducing disparity error between the super-resolved images and the ground truth (GT) images. Additionally, a stereo omni attention control network (SOA ControlNet) is proposed to enhance the consistency of super-resolved images with GT images in the pixel, perceptual, and distribution space. Finally, DiffSteISR incorporates a stereo semantic extractor (SSE) to capture unique viewpoint soft semantic information and shared hard tag semantic information, thereby effectively improving the semantic accuracy and consistency of the generated left and right images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffSteISR accurately reconstructs natural and precise textures from low-resolution stereo images while maintaining a high consistency of semantic and texture between the left and right views.</description>
