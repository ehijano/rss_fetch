      <title>LASY: LAser manipulations made eaSY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using realistic laser profiles for simulations of laser-plasma interaction is critical to reproduce experimental measurements, but the interface between experiments and simulations can be challenging. Similarly, start-to-end simulations with different codes may require error-prone manipulations to convert between different representations of a laser pulse. In this work, we propose LASY, an open-source Python library to simplify these workflows. Developed through an international collaboration between experimental, theoretical and computational physicists, LASY can be used to initialize a laser profile from an experimental measurement, from a simulation, or from analytics, manipulate it, and write it into a file in compliance with the openPMD standard. This profile can then be used as an input of a simulation code.</description>

      <title>Octave-wide broadening of ultraviolet dispersive wave driven by soliton-splitting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent dispersive wave emission, as an important phenomenon of soliton dynamics, manifests itself in multiple platforms of nonlinear optics from fibre waveguides to integrated photonics. Limited by its resonance nature, efficient generation of coherent dispersive wave with ultra-broad bandwidth has, however, proved difficult to realize. Here, we unveil a new regime of soliton dynamics in which the dispersive wave emission process strongly couples with the splitting dynamics of the driving pulse. High-order dispersion and self-steepening effects, accumulated over soliton self-compression, break the system symmetry, giving rise to high-efficiency generation of coherent dispersive wave in the ultraviolet region. Simultaneously, asymmetric soliton splitting results in the appearance of a temporally-delayed ultrashort pulse with high intensity, overlapping and copropagating with the dispersive wave pulse. Intense cross-phase modulations lead to octave-wide broadening of the dispersive wave spectrum, covering 200 to 400 nm wavelengths. The highly-coherent, octave-wide ultraviolet spectrum, generated from the simple capillary fibre set-up, is in great demand for time-resolved spectroscopy, ultrafast electron microscopy and frequency metrology applications, and the critical role of the secondary pulse in this process reveals some new opportunities for all-optical control of versatile soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the orbit-induced spin density of tightly focused optical vortex beams: ellipticity and helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been established that a linearly-polarized optical vortex possesses spin angular momentum density in the direction of propagation (longitudinal spin) under tight-focusing. The helicity of light has long been associated with longitudinal spin angular momentum. Here we show that the longitudinal spin density of linearly-polarized vortices is anomalous because it has no associated helicity. It was also recently determined that the polarization-independent helicity of tightly-focused optical vortices is associated with their transverse spin momentum density. The key finding of this work is the fact that, in general, longitudinal spin can not necessarily be associated with helicity, and transverse spin is in general not associated with a zero helicity, and such extraordinary behaviour manifests most clearly for optical vortices under non-paraxial conditions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian uncertainty evaluation applied to the tilted-wave interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tilted-wave interferometer is a promising technique for the development of a reference measurement system for the highly accurate form measurement of aspheres and freeform surfaces. The technique combines interferometric measurements, acquired with a special setup, and sophisticated mathematical evaluation procedures. To determine the form of the surface under test, a computational model is required that closely mimics the measurement process of the physical measurement instruments. The parameters of the computational model, comprising the surface under test sought, are then tuned by solving an inverse problem. Due to this embedded structure of the real experiment and computational model and the overall complexity, a thorough uncertainty evaluation is challenging. In this work, a Bayesian approach is proposed to tackle the inverse problem, based on a statistical model derived from the computational model of the tilted-wave interferometer. Such a procedure naturally allows for uncertainty quantification to be made. We present an approximate inference scheme to efficiently sample quantities of the posterior using Monte Carlo sampling involving the statistical model. In particular, the methodology derived is applied to the tilted-wave interferometer to obtain an estimate and corresponding uncertainty of the pixel-by-pixel form of the surface under test for two typical surfaces taking into account a number of key influencing factors. A statistical analysis using experimental design is employed to identify main influencing factors and a subsequent analysis confirms the efficacy of the method derived.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of ultrafast pulses via spectral inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolution limits of classical spectroscopy can be surpassed by quantum-inspired methods leveraging the information contained in the phase of the complex electromagnetic field. Their counterpart in spatial imaging has been widely discussed and demonstrated; however, the spectral-domain implementations are few and scarce. We experimentally demonstrate a spectroscopic super-resolution method aimed at broadband light (10s to 100s of GHz), and based on the spectral-domain analog of image inversion interferometry. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we study the paradigmatic problem of estimating a small separation between two incoherent spectral features of equal brightness, with a small number of photons per coherence time. On the grounds of asymptotic estimation theory, more than a $2$-fold improvement over the spectral direct imaging is demonstrated in terms of required resources (photons) for a given estimator variance. The setup is based on an actively stabilized Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer with electro-optic time lenses and passive spectral dispersers implementing the inversion. As such, the method promises on-chip integration, good scalability, and further applications e.g. for mode sorting.</description>

      <title>Stability restoration by asymmetric nonlinear states in non-Hermitian double-well potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of one-dimensional complex optical potentials that feature a nonlinearity-induced stability restoration, i.e., the existence of stable nonlinear modes propagating in a waveguide whose linear eigenmodes are unstable. The optical potential is an even function of the transverse coordinate, i.e., the system is parity symmetric but not parity-time symmetric. The stability restoration occurs for asymmetric stationary nonlinear modes that do not respect the parity symmetry. Stable nonlinear states exist either for focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. On the qualitative level the stability restoration cab be analyzed using a simple bimodal system. Its solutions enable systematic construction of stable stationary modes and more complex patterns with intensity periodically oscillating along the propagation distance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Digital Hologram Reconstruction Using Reverse-Attention Loss for Untrained Physics-Driven Deep Learning Models with Uncertain Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Untrained Physics-based Deep Learning (DL) methods for digital holography have gained significant attention due to their benefits, such as not requiring an annotated training dataset, and providing interpretability since utilizing the governing laws of hologram formation. However, they are sensitive to the hard-to-obtain precise object distance from the imaging plane, posing the $\textit{Autofocusing}$ challenge. Conventional solutions involve reconstructing image stacks for different potential distances and applying focus metrics to select the best results, which apparently is computationally inefficient. In contrast, recently developed DL-based methods treat it as a supervised task, which again needs annotated data and lacks generalizability. To address this issue, we propose $\textit{reverse-attention loss}$, a weighted sum of losses for all possible candidates with learnable weights. This is a pioneering approach to addressing the Autofocusing challenge in untrained deep-learning methods. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate its superiority in efficiency and accuracy. Interestingly, our method presents a significant reconstruction performance over rival methods (i.e. alternating descent-like optimization, non-weighted loss integration, and random distance assignment) and even is almost equal to that achieved with a precisely known object distance. For example, the difference is less than 1dB in PSNR and 0.002 in SSIM for the target sample in our experiment.</description>

      <title>Topology reconstruction for asymmetric systems by isomorphic mapping or perturbation approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systems without symmetries, e.g. the internal or spatial symmetry, are generally thought to be improper for topological study and no conventional integral topological invariant can be well defined. In this work, with multi-band asymmetric Rice-Mele-like systems as examples, we show that the topology of all gaps can be reconstructed by two general methods and a new integral topological invariant, i.e. the renormalized real-space winding number, can properly characterise the topology of such systems. For the first method, an isomorphic mapping relationship between a Rice-Mele-like system and its chiral counterpart is constructed, which accounts for the topology reconstruction at half-filling gaps. For the second method, the Hilbert space of asymmetric systems could be reduced into degenerate subspaces by perturbation approximation, so that the topology in subspaces accounts for the topology reconstruction at fractional-filling gaps. The perturbation-based topology exhibits extraordinary robustness since it even exists beyond the weak perturbation limit. We also show that both methods can be widely used for other asymmetric systems, e.g. the two-dimensional (2D) Rice-Mele systems and the superconductor systems. At last, for the asymmetric photonic systems, we predict different topological edge states by our topology-reconstruction theory and experimentally observe them in the laboratory, which agree with each other very well. Our findings open a door for investigating new topological phenomena in asymmetric systems by various topological reconstruction methods which should greatly expand the category of topology study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2-D(Two-dimensional) isotropic negative refractive index (NRI) is explicitly realized via the orthogonal signal and coupling standing-wave fields coupling the N-type four-level atomic system. Under some key parameters of the dense vapor media, the atomic system exhibits isotropic NRI with simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability (i.e. Left-handedness) in the 2-D x-y plane. Compared with other 2-D NRI schemes, the coherent atomic vapor media in our scheme may be an ideal 2-D isotropic NRI candidate and has some potential advantages, significance or applications in the further investigation.</description>

      <title>Intervalence Plasmons in Boron-Doped Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doped semiconductors are capable of exhibiting metallic-like properties ranging from superconductivity to tunable localized surface plasmon resonances. Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, which could facilitate optical applications, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low energy excitations is provided by scanning transmission electron microscope-valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Remarkably, the calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a resonance characteristic of metallicity (narrow-banded negative values of the dielectric function). The energy of the zero-crossing and the position of the loss peak are found to coincide, and both increase with the carrier density. Our results provide insight into a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in doped semiconductors from intervalence band transitions, and the possibility of attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for biomedical and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, machine learning tools, particularly artificial neural networks, have become crucial for diverse applications. However, current digital computing tools to train and deploy artificial neural networks often struggle with massive data sizes and high power consumptions. Optical computing provides inherent parallelism and perform fundamental operations with passive optical components. However, most of the optical computing platforms suffer from relatively low accuracies for machine learning tasks due to fixed connections while avoiding complex and sensitive techniques. Here, we demonstrate a genetically programmable yet simple optical neural network to achieve high performances with optical random projection. By genetically programming the orientation of the scattering medium which acts as a random projection kernel and only using 1% of the search space, our novel technique finds an optimum kernel and improves its initial test accuracies 7-22% for various machine learning tasks. Our optical computing method presents a promising approach to achieve high performance in optical neural networks with a simple and scalable design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To add to the rapidly progressing field of ultrafast photocurrent, we propose a universal method to generate photocurrent in normal and topological materials using a pair of multicycle linearly polarized laser pulses. The interplay of the fundamental and its second harmonic pulses is studied for the generation of photocurrent in Weyl semimetals by varying the angle between the polarization direction, relative intensity, and relative phase delay. It has been found that the presence of a comparatively weaker second harmonic pulse is sufficient to generate substantial photocurrent. Moreover, significant photocurrent is generated even when polarization directions are orthogonal for certain ratios of the lasers' intensities. In addition, the photocurrent is found to be susceptible to the delay between the two pulses. We have illustrated that all our findings are extendable to non-topological and two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide.</description>

      <title>High Precision Inertial Sensors on a One Inch Diameter Optic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact, high-precision inertial sensors are needed to isolate many modern physics experiments from disturbances caused by seismic motion. We present a novel inertial sensor whose mechanical oscillator fits on a standard one-inch diameter optic. The oscillators achieve a Quality factor of over 600,000 and a resonance frequency of 50\,Hz, giving them a suspension thermal noise floor lower than all commercially available inertial sensors. The oscillator is combined with a Pound-Drever-Hall based readout scheme that achieves a displacement noise of 100\,f\msqrthz above 0.2\,Hz. We integrate the oscillator and readout to make two inertial sensors. Of order n$g$ performance is achieved in a broad band from 0.1\,Hz to 200\,Hz. Below 20\,Hz, the sensor presented here offers comparable performance to the best inertial sensors available today while being a fraction of the size. Above 20\,Hz, the sensor is, to the author's knowledge, the best demonstrated in the literature to date for a device of this style, with a self-noise floor of 0.1\,n$g$\sqrthz. The excellent performance of the sensors across the relevant seismic frequencies, vacuum compatibility, and compact size make it a prime candidate for integration into sophisticated seismic isolation schemes, such as those used by gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Optical Atomic Clock Interrogation Via an Integrated Spiral Cavity Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks have demonstrated revolutionary advances in precision timekeeping, but their applicability to the real world is critically dependent on whether such clocks can operate outside a laboratory setting. The challenge to clock portability stems from the many obstacles not only in miniaturizing the underlying components of the clock $-$ namely the ultrastable laser, the frequency comb, and the atomic reference itself $-$ but also in making the clock resilient to environmental fluctuations. Photonic integration offers one compelling solution to simultaneously address the problems of miniaturization and ruggedization, but brings with it a new set of challenges in recreating the functionality of an optical clock using chip-scale building blocks. The clock laser used for atom interrogation is one particular point of uncertainty, as the performance of the meticulously-engineered bulk-cavity stabilized lasers would be exceptionally difficult to transfer to chip. Here we demonstrate that a chip-integrated ultrahigh quality factor (Q) spiral cavity, when interfaced with a 1348 nm seed laser, reaches a fractional frequency instability of $7.5 \times 10^{-14}$, meeting the stability requirements for interrogating the narrow-linewidth transition of $^{88}$Sr$^+$ upon frequency doubling to 674 nm. In addition to achieving the record for laser stability on chip, we use this laser to showcase the operation of a Sr-ion clock with short-term instability averaging down as $3.9 \times 10^{-14} / \sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the averaging time. Our demonstration of an optical atomic clock interrogated by an integrated spiral cavity laser opens the door for future advanced clock systems to be entirely constructed using lightweight, portable, and mass-manufacturable integrated optics and electronics.</description>

Abstract: The multifrequency quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) with a large valley Chern number has been realized to significantly improve the transmission capacity of topological waveguides and increase the mode density of topological waveguides. However, multifrequency and multimode QVHEs have not been realized simultaneously. In this work, using tight-binding model calculations and numerical simulations, a valley photonic crystal (VPC) consisting of a Stampfli-triangle photonic crystal is constructed, and its multiple degeneracies in the low-frequency and high-frequency bands split simultaneously to realize the QVHE with multiple topological edge states (TESs). The multifrequency and multimode topological transmission with two low-frequency modes and four high-frequency modes is realized by means of simulations and experiments through a Z-shaped waveguide constructed using two VPCs with opposite valley Chern numbers to prove the realization of a large valley Chern number in the two frequency bands. The two low-frequency modes are successfully distinguished with position-dependent selective excitations, which experimentally demonstrates the occurrence of a large valley Chern number. A frequency-dependent multimode beam splitter is theoretically proposed for high-performance integrated photonic device applications. These results provide new ideas for high-efficiency and high-capacity optical transmission and communication devices and their integration; furthermore, they broaden the application range of TESs.</description>

      <title>Cubic magneto-optic Kerr effect in Ni(111) thin films with and without twinning</title>

Abstract: In most studies utilizing the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), the detected change of polarized light upon reflection from a magnetized sample is supposed to be proportional to the magnetization $\boldsymbol{M}$. However, MOKE signatures quadratic in $\boldsymbol{M}$ have also been identified and utilized, e.g., to sense the structural order in Heusler compounds, to detect spin-orbit torques or to image antiferromagnetic domains. In our study, we observe a strong anisotropic MOKE contribution of third order in $\boldsymbol{M}$ in Ni(111) thin films, attributed to a cubic magneto-optic tensor $\propto $ $\boldsymbol{M}^3$. We further show that the angular dependence of cubic MOKE (CMOKE) is affected by the amount of structural domain twinning in the sample. Our detailed study on CMOKE for two selected photon energies will open up new opportunities for CMOKE applications with sensitivity to twinning properties of thin films, e.g. CMOKE spectroscopy and microscopy or time-resolved CMOKE.</description>

      <title>Limits and prospects for long-baseline optical fiber interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's most precise optical instruments -- gravitational-wave interferometers and optical atomic clocks -- rely on long storage times for photons to realize their exquisite sensitivity. Optical fiber technology is the most widely deployed platform for realizing long-distance optical propagation. Yet, their application to precision optical measurements is sparse. We review the state-of-the-art in the noise performance of conventional (solid-core) optical fibers from the perspective of precision optical measurements and quantum technology that rely on precise transfer of information over long distances. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of this platform and point to the opportunities that structured fiber technology offers to overcome some of these limitations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Transverse Laguerre-Gauss Modes in Parametric Down-Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first color photos of the parametric down-conversion (PDC) emission cone illustrate the correlation of longitudinal- and transverse momentum in the process, i.e., wavelength-dependent emission angle of PDC photons. However, current experiments and applications are more conveniently described in terms of discrete mode sets, with the most suitable choice depending on the propagation symmetries of the experimental setting. Remarkably, despite the fact that experiments with PDC sources are becoming ever more demanding, e.g. in terms of brightness or state fidelity, a description of spectral-spatial coupling in parametric downconversion for the case of discrete modal decompositions remains elusive. We present a comprehensive study, in theory and experiment, of the spectral dependence of the transverse Laguerre-Gauss modes in parametric downconversion. Moreover, we show how the spectral and spatial coupling can be harnessed to tune the purity of the well-known orbital angular momentum entanglement. This work has implications for efficient collection of entangled photons in a transverse single mode, quantum imaging, and engineering pure states for high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Dicke superradiance in ordered arrays of multilevel atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inverted atomic ensembles, photon-mediated interactions give rise to Dicke superradiance, a form of many-body decay that results in a rapid release of energy as a photon burst. While originally studied in pointlike ensembles, this phenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the inter-particle distance is below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in a realistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new opportunities for light-matter interactions as their internal structure allows for trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their long-wavelength transitions, providing the potential for collectively enhanced dissipative interactions. Despite their intricate electronic structure, we show that two-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should exhibit many-body superradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover, superradiance effectively ``closes'' transitions, such that multilevel atoms become more two-level like. This occurs because the avalanchelike decay funnels the emission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming the single-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman branching. Our work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth atoms as quantum optical sources and as platforms to explore many-body dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Time correlations in atmospheric quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient transfer of quantum information between remote parties is a crucial challenge for quantum communication over atmospheric channels. Random fluctuations of the channel transmittance are a major disturbing factor for its practical implementation. We study correlations between channel transmittances at different moments of time and focus on two transmission protocols. The first is related to the robustness of both discrete- and continuous-variable entanglement between time-separated light pulses, showing a possibility to enlarge the effective dimension of the Hilbert space. The second addresses a selection of high-transmittance events by testing them with bright classical pulses followed by quantum light. Our results show a high capacity of the time-coherence resource for encoding and transferring quantum states of light in atmospheric channels.</description>
