      <title>Constrained portfolio optimization in a life-cycle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the constrained portfolio optimization in a generalized life-cycle model. The individual with a stochastic income manages a portfolio consisting of stocks, a bond, and life insurance to maximize his or her consumption level, death benefit, and terminal wealth. Meanwhile, the individual faces a convex-set trading constraint, of which the non-tradeable asset constraint, no short-selling constraint, and no borrowing constraint are special cases. Following Cuoco (1997), we build the artificial markets to derive the dual problem and prove the existence of the original problem. With additional discussions, we extend his uniformly bounded assumption on the interest rate to an almost surely finite expectation condition and enlarge his uniformly bounded assumption on the income process to a bounded expectation condition. Moreover, we propose a dual control neural network approach to compute tight lower and upper bounds for the original problem, which can be utilized in more general cases than the simulation of artificial markets strategies (SAMS) approach in Bick et al. (2013). Finally, we conclude that when considering the trading constraints, the individual will reduce his or her demand for life insurance.</description>

      <title>Optimal life insurance and annuity decision under money illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal consumption, investment, and life insurance/annuity decisions for a family in an inflationary economy under money illusion. The family can invest in a financial market that consists of nominal bonds, inflation-linked bonds, and a stock index. The breadwinner can also purchase life insurance or annuities that are available continuously. The family's objective is to maximize the expected utility of a mixture of nominal and real consumption, as they partially overlook inflation and tend to think in terms of nominal rather than real monetary values. We formulate this life-cycle problem as a random horizon utility maximization problem and derive the optimal strategy. We calibrate our model to the U.S. data and demonstrate that money illusion increases life insurance demand for young adults and reduces annuity demand for retirees. Our findings indicate that the money illusion contributes to the annuity puzzle and highlights the role of financial literacy in an inflationary environment.</description>

      <title>Extracting Alpha from Financial Analyst Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of a momentum trading signal based on the coverage network of financial analysts. This signal builds on the key information-brokerage role financial sell-side analysts play in modern stock markets. The baskets of stocks covered by each analyst can be used to construct a network between firms whose edge weights represent the number of analysts jointly covering both firms. Although the link between financial analysts coverage and co-movement of firms' stock prices has been investigated in the literature, little effort has been made to systematically learn the most effective combination of signals from firms covered jointly by analysts in order to benefit from any spillover effect. To fill this gap, we build a trading strategy which leverages the analyst coverage network using a graph attention network. More specifically, our model learns to aggregate information from individual firm features and signals from neighbouring firms in a node-level forecasting task. We develop a portfolio based on those predictions which we demonstrate to exhibit an annualized returns of 29.44% and a Sharpe ratio of 4.06 substantially outperforming market baselines and existing graph machine learning based frameworks. We further investigate the performance and robustness of this strategy through extensive empirical analysis. Our paper represents one of the first attempts in using graph machine learning to extract actionable knowledge from the analyst coverage network for practical financial applications.</description>
