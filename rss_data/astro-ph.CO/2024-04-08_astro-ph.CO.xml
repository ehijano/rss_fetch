      <title>Substructures within Substructures in the Complex Post-Merging System A514 Unveiled by High-Resolution Magellan/Megacam Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abell 514 (A514) at $z=0.071$ is an intriguing merging system exhibiting highly elongated (~1 Mpc) X-ray features and three large-scale (300~500 kpc) bent radio jets. To dissect this system with its multi-wavelength data, it is critical to robustly identify and quantify its dark matter (DM) substructures. We present a weak-lensing analysis of A514 using deep Magellan/Megacam observations. Combining two optical band filter imaging data obtained under optimal seeing (~0.''6) and leveraging the proximity of A514, we achieve a high source density of ~$46\mbox{arcmin}^{-2}$ or ~$\mathrm{6940Mpc^{-2}}$, which enables high-resolution mass reconstruction. We unveil the complex DM substructures of A514, which are characterized by the NW and SE subclusters separated by ~$0.7$Mpc, each exhibiting a bimodal mass distribution. The total mass of the NW subcluster is estimated to be $\mathrm{M^{NW}_{200c} = 1.08_{-0.22}^{+0.24} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}}$ and is further resolved into the eastern ($\mathrm{M^{NW_E}_{200c} = 2.6_{-1.1}^{+1.4} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}})$ and western ($\mathrm{M^{NW_W}_{200c} = 7.1_{-2.0}^{+2.3} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}}$) components. The mass of the SE subcluster is $\mathrm{M^{SE}_{200c} = 1.55_{-0.26}^{+0.28} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}}$, which is also further resolved into the northern ($\mathrm{M^{SE_N}_{200c} = 2.9_{-1.3}^{+1.8} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}}$) and southern ($\mathrm{M^{SE_S}_{200c} = 8.5_{-2.6}^{+3.0} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}}$) components. These four substructures coincide with the A514 brightest galaxies and are detected with significances ranging from 3.4$\sigma$ to 4.8$\sigma$. Comparison of the dark matter substructures with the X-ray distribution suggests that A514 might have experienced an off-axis collision, and the NW and SE subclusters are currently near their apocenters.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation from Ly$\alpha$ forest in Fourier space using Information Maximising Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to present a robust parameter estimation with simulated Lya forest spectra from Sherwood-Relics simulations suite using Information Maximizing Neural Network(IMNN) to extract maximal information from Lya 1D-transmitted flux in Fourier space. We perform 1D estimations using IMNN for IGM thermal parameters $T_0$ &amp; $\gamma$ at z=2-4 and cosmological parameters $\sigma_8$ &amp; $n_s$ at z=3-4. We compare our results with estimates from power spectrum using posterior distribution from Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC). We then check robustness of IMNN estimates against deviation in spectral noise levels,continuum uncertainties &amp; instrumental smoothing effects. Using mock Lya forest sightlines from publicly available CAMELS project we also check the robustness of the trained IMNN on a different simulation. We also perform a 2D-parameter estimation for $T_0$ &amp; HI photoionization rates $\Gamma_{HI}$. We obtain improved estimates of $T_0$ &amp; $\gamma$ using IMNN over standard MCMC approach. These estimates are also more robust against SNR deviations at z=2 &amp; 3. At z=4 the sensitivity to noise deviations is on par with MCMC estimates. The IMNN also provides $T_0$ and $\gamma$ estimates which are robust against continuum uncertainties by extracting continuum-independent small-scale information from Fourier domain. In case of $\sigma_8$ &amp; $n_s$ IMNN performs on par with MCMC but still offers a significant speed boost in estimating parameters from a new dataset. The improved estimates with IMNN are seen for high instrumental-resolution(FWHM=6km/s). At medium or low resolutions IMNN performs similar to MCMC suggesting an improved extraction of small-scale information with IMNN. We also find that IMNN estimates are robust against the choice of simulation. By performing a 2D-parameter estimation for $T_0$ &amp; $\Gamma_{HI}$ we also demonstrate how to take forward this approach observationally in the future.</description>

      <title>Surface Brightness Fluctuations in Two SPT clusters: a Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of surface brightness fluctuations in the intracluster medium (ICM) present an indirect probe of turbulent properties such as the turbulent velocities, injection scales, and the slope of the power spectrum of fluctuations towards smaller scales. With the advancement of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) studies and surveys relative to X-ray observations, we seek to investigate surface brightness fluctuations in a sample of SPT-SZ clusters which also have archival \textit{XMM-Newton} data. Here we present a pilot study of two typical clusters in that sample: SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and SPT-CLJ0638-5358. We infer injection scales larger than 500 kpc in both clusters and Mach numbers $\approx 0.5$ in SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and Mach numbers $\approx 0.6 - 1.6$ in SPT-CLJ0638-5358, which has a known shock. We find hydrostatic bias values for $M_{500}$ less than 0.2 for SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and less than 0.1 for SPT-CLJ0638-5358. These results show the importance to assess its quantitative values via a detailed multiwavelength approach and suggest that the drivers of turbulence may occur at quite larger scales.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray (ICM-SHOX). Paper II: Galaxy cluster sample overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers are representative of a wide range of physics, making them an excellent probe of the properties of dark matter and the ionized plasma of the intracluster medium. To date, most studies have focused on mergers occurring in the plane of the sky, where morphological features can be readily identified. To allow study of mergers with arbitrary orientation, we have assembled multi-probe data for the eight-cluster ICM-SHOX sample sensitive to both morphology and line of sight velocity. The first ICM-SHOX paper (Silich+2023) provided an overview of our methodology applied to one member of the sample, MACS J0018.5+1626, in order to constrain its merger geometry. That work resulted in an exciting new discovery of a velocity space decoupling of its gas and dark matter distributions. In this work, we describe the availability and quality of multi-probe data for the full ICM-SHOX galaxy cluster sample. These datasets will form the observational basis of an upcoming full ICM-SHOX galaxy cluster sample analysis.</description>

      <title>OLIMPO: a Balloon-Borne SZE Imager to Probe ICM Dynamics and the WHIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OLIMPO is a proposed Antarctic balloon-borne Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) imager to study gas dynamics associated with structure formation along with the properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) residing in the connective filaments. During a 25 day flight OLIMPO will image a total of 10 z~0.05 galaxy clusters and 8 bridges at 145, 250, 365, and 460 GHz at an angular resolution of 1.0'-3.3'. The maps will be significantly deeper than those planned from CMB-S4 and CCAT-P, and will have excellent fidelity to the large angular scales of our low-z targets, which are difficult to probe from the ground. In combination with X-ray data from eROSITA and XRISM we will transform our current static view of galaxy clusters into a full dynamic picture by measuring the internal intra-cluster medium (ICM) velocity structure with the kinematic SZE, X-ray spectroscopy, and the power spectrum of ICM fluctuations. Radio observations from ASKAP and MeerKAT will be used to better understand the connection between ICM turbulence and shocks with the relativistic plasma. Beyond the cluster boundary, we will combine thermal SZE maps from OLIMPO with X-ray imaging from eROSITA to measure the thermodynamics of the WHIM residing in filaments, providing a better understanding of its properties and its contribution to the total baryon budget.</description>

      <title>Wide-Angle Effects in the Power Spectrum Multipoles in Next-Generation Redshift Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As galaxy redshift surveys expand to larger areas on the sky, effects coming from the curved nature of the sky become important, introducing wide-angle (WA) corrections to the power spectrum multipoles at large galaxy-pair separations. These corrections particularly impact the measurement of physical effects that are predominantly detected on large scales, such the local primordial non-Gaussianities. In this paper, we examine the validity of the perturbative approach to modeling WA effects in the power spectrum multipoles for upcoming surveys by comparing to measurements on simulated galaxy catalogs using the Yamamoto estimator. We show that on the scales $k \lesssim 2\pi/\chi$, where $\chi$ is the comoving distance to the galaxies, the estimated power spectrum monopole differs by up to $5\%$ from the second-order perturbative result, with similar absolute deviations for higher multipoles. To enable precision comparison, we pioneer an improved treatment of the $\mu$-leakage effects in the Yamamoto estimator. Additionally, we devise a solution to include $f_{\rm NL}$ in the perturbative WA calculations, avoiding divergences in the original framework through the integral constraint. This allows us to conclude that WA effects can mimic a $f_{\rm NL}\sim5$ signal in the lowest SPHEREx redshift bin. We recommend using non-perturbative methods to model large scale power spectrum multipoles for $f_{\rm NL}$ measurements. A companion paper, Wen et al. 2024, addresses this by introducing a new non-perturbative method going through the spherical Fourier-Bessel basis.</description>

      <title>Exact Modeling of Power Spectrum Multipole through Spherical Fourier-Bessel Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum is a powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity and additional general relativistic effects, which become important on large scales. At the same time, wide-angle (WA) effects due to differing lines-of-sight (LOS) on the curved sky also become important with large angular separation. In this work, we accurately model WA and Doppler effects using the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) formalism, before transforming the result into the commonly used power spectrum multipoles (PSM). This mapping from the SFB power spectrum to PSM represents a new way to non-perturbatively model WA and GR effects present in the PSM, which we validate with log-normal mocks. Moreover, for the first time, we can compute the analytical PSM Gaussian covariance on large scales, exactly including WA-induced mode-couplings, without resorting to any plane-parallel approximations.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: Large-scale view of the Centaurus cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods. We utilized the combined five SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey data (eRASS:5) to perform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses of the Centaurus cluster in various directions to large radii. Surface brightness (SB) profiles out to $2R_{200}$ were constructed. We acquired gas temperature, metallicity, and normalization per area profiles out to $R_{200}$. We compared our results with previous Centaurus studies, cluster outskirts measurements, and simulations. Comprehensive sky background analysis was done across the FoV, in particular, to assess the variation of the eROSITA Bubble emission that partially contaminates the field. Results. The processed X-ray images show the known sloshing-induced structures in the core. The core ($r\leq11~\mathrm{kpc}$) is better described with a 2T model than a 1T model. Here, we measured lower T from the cooler component (~1.0 keV) and higher Z ($\sim\!1.6Z_\odot$), signifying an iron bias. In the intermediate radial range, we observed prominent SB and normalization per area excesses in the eastern sector (Cen 45 location), reaching out to $R_{500}$. Temperature enhancements near the location of Cen 45 imply that the gas is shock-heated due to the interaction with Cen 30, the significant excess behind Cen 45 center might be the tail/ram-pressure-stripped gas. We found good agreement between the outskirt temperatures with the profile from simulations and fit from Suzaku outskirts measurements. We detected significant SB emission to the sky background level out to $R_{200}$ with a $3.5\sigma$ and followed by $2.9\sigma$ at $1.1R_{200}$. The metallicity at $R_{500}-R_{200}$ is low but within the ranges of other outskirts studies. Conclusions. We present the first measurement of ICM morphology and properties of Centaurus cluster sampling the whole azimuth beyond $30'$, increasing the probed volume by a factor of almost 30.</description>

      <title>Halo asymmetry in the modelling of galaxy clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional studies of galaxy clustering within the framework of halo models typically assume that the density profile of all dark matter haloes can be approximated by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) spherically symmetric profile. However, both modern N-body simulations and observational data suggest that most haloes are either oblate or prolate, and almost never spherical. In this paper we present a modified model of the galaxy correlation function. In addition to the five "classical" HOD parameters proposed by Zheng et al. 2007, it includes an additional free parameter $\phi$ in the modified NFW density profile describing the asymmetry of the host dark matter halo.
  Using a subhalo abundance matching model (SHAM), we populate galaxies within BolshoiP N-body simulations. We compute the projected two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ for six stellar mass volume limited galaxy samples. We fit our model to the results, and then compare the best-fit asymmetry parameter $\phi$ (and other halo parameters) to the asymmetry of dark matter haloes measured directly from the simulations and find that they agree within 1$\sigma$. We then fit our model to the $w_p(r_p)$ results from Zehavi et al. 2011 and compare halo parameters. We show that our model accurately retrieves the halo asymmetry and other halo parameters. Additionally, we find $2-6\%$ differences between the halo masses ($\log M_{min}$ and $\log M_1$) estimated by our model and "classical" HOD models. The model proposed in this paper can serve as an alternative to multiparameter HOD models, since it can be used for relatively small samples of galaxies.</description>

      <title>The cosmological collider in $R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R^2$ inflation manifests a best-fit scenario for the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations. Observables derived from the slow-roll picture of the $R^2$ model in the Einstein frame relies on the conformal transformation of the metric, which inevitably induces a unique exponential-type couplings of the rolling scalaron with all matter fields during inflation. The "large-field" nature of the $R^2$ model further invokes non-negligible time and scale dependence to the matter sector through such an exponential coupling, modifying not only the dynamics of matter perturbations on superhorizon scales but also their decay rates. In this work, we identify the simplest observable of the cosmological collider physics built in the background of $R^2$ inflation, focusing on the so-called "quantum primordial clock" signals created by the non-local propagation of massive scalar perturbations. Our numerical formalism based on the unique conformal coupling can have extended applications to (quasi-)single-field inflationary models with non-trivial couplings to gravity or models originated from the $f(R)$ modification of gravity.</description>

      <title>Current and future cosmological impact of microwave background temperature measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshift dependence of the cosmic microwave background temperature, $T(z)=T_0(1+z)$, is a key prediction of standard cosmology, but this relation is violated in many extensions thereof. Current astrophysical facilities can probe it in the redshift range $0\le z\le6.34$. We extend recent work by Gelo {\it et al.} (2022) showing that for several classes of models (all of which aim to provide alternative mechanisms for the recent acceleration of the universe) the constraining power of these measurements is comparable to that of other background cosmology probes. Specifically, we discuss constraints on two classes of models not considered in the earlier work: a model with torsion and a recently proposed phenomenological dynamical dark energy model which can be thought of as a varying speed of light model. Moreover, for both these models and also for those in the earlier work, we discuss how current constraints may be improved by next-generation ground and space astrophysical facilities. Overall, we conclude that these measurements have a significant cosmological impact, mainly because they often constrain combinations of model parameters that are orthogonal, in the relevant parameter space, to those of other probes.</description>

      <title>Tackling Challenges in 21cm Global Spectrum Experiment: the Impact of Ionosphere and Beam Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HI 21cm global signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) offers critical insights into the evolution of our Universe. Yet, its detection presents significant challenges due to its extremely low signal-to-contamination ratio and complex instrumental systematics. In this paper, we examine the effects of the ionosphere and antenna beam on data analysis. The ionosphere, an ionized plasma layer in the Earth's atmosphere, refracts, absorbs, and emits radio waves in the relevant frequency range. This interaction results in additional spectral distortion of the observed signal, complicating the process of foreground subtraction. Additionally, chromatic variations in the beam can also introduce further contamination into the global spectrum measurement. Notably, the ionospheric effect, being dependent on the direction of incoming light, interacts with the instrumental beam, adding another layer of complexity. To address this, we evaluate three different fitting templates of foreground: the logarithmic polynomial, the physically motivated EDGES template, and a SVD-based template. Our findings indicate that the EDGES and SVD templates generally surpass logarithmic polynomials in performance. Recognizing the significance of beam chromaticity, we further investigate specific beam distortion models and their impacts on the signal extraction process.</description>

      <title>A theoretical perspective on the almost dark galaxy Nube: exploring the fuzzy dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent astronomical observations, an almost dark galaxy, designated as Nube, has unveiled an intriguing anomaly in its stellar distribution. Specifically, Nube exhibits an exceptionally low central brightness, with the 2D half-light radius of its stars far exceeding the typical values found in dwarf galaxies, and even surpassing those observed in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). This phenomenon is difficult to explain within the framework of cold dark matter (CDM). Meanwhile, due to its ultralight particle mass, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) exhibits a de Broglie wavelength on the order of kiloparsecs under the typical velocities of galaxies. The interference between different modes of the FDM wave gives rise to fluctuations in the gravitational field, which can lead to the dynamical heating of stars within galaxies, resulting in an expansion of their spatial distribution. In this paper, we aim to interpret the anomalous stellar distribution observed in Nube as a consequence of the dynamical heating effect induced by FDM. Our findings suggest that a FDM particle mass around $1-2\times 10^{-23}$ eV can effectively account for this anomaly. And we propose that the FDM dynamical heating effect provides a new insight into understanding the formation of field UDGs.</description>

      <title>Generating Galaxy Clusters Mass Density Maps from Mock Multiview Images via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are composed of dark matter, gas and stars. Their dark matter component, which amounts to around 80\% of the total mass, cannot be directly observed but traced by the distribution of diffused gas and galaxy members. In this work, we aim to infer the cluster's projected total mass distribution from mock observational data, i.e. stars, Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and X-ray, by training deep learning models. To this end, we have created a multiview images dataset from {\sc{The Three Hundred}} simulation that is optimal for training Machine Learning models. We further study deep learning architectures based on the U-Net to account for single-input and multi-input models. We show that the predicted mass distribution agrees well with the true one.</description>

      <title>New ideas on the formation and astrophysical detection of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a number of novel scenarios for primordial black hole (PBH) formation have been discovered. Some of them require very minimal new physics, some others require no new ingredients besides those already present in commonly considered models, such as supersymmetry. At the same time, new strategies have emerged for detection of PBHs. For example, an observation of an orphan kilonova unaccompanied by the gravitational waves signal of merging neutron stars, but associated with a fast radio burst, could be a smoking gun of PBH dark matter. We review some new ideas for PBH formation and detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the astrophysical gravitational-wave background resulting from compact binary coalescences, focusing on Population III binary black holes. We exploit results of state-of-the-art simulations on the evolution of Population I-II and III binaries, considering a variety of initial condition and star formation rate models for the latter. The contribution from Population III binary black holes is found to be very small, with no effect on the gravitational-wave spectrum. A network of third-generation detectors will detect easier individual Population III binaries, due to their significantly higher masses, hence decreasing even further their residual contribution.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, recently discovered from pulsar timing array experiments, is still unclear. If this background is of astrophysical origin, we expect the distribution of GW sources to follow the one of galaxies. Since galaxies are not perfectly isotropically distributed at large scales, but follow the cosmological large-scale structure, this would lead to an intrinsic anisotropy in the distribution of GW sources. In this work, we develop a formalism to account for this anisotropy, by considering a Gaussian ensemble of sources in each realization of the universe and then taking ensemble averages over all such realizations. We find that large-scale galaxy clustering has no impact on the Hellings-Downs curve, describing the expectation value of pulsar timing residual correlations. However, it introduces a new contribution to the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation. Hence, due to the anisotropic distribution of sources, the measurements of pulsar timing residual correlations in our Universe may differ from the Hellings-Downs curve. This indicates that the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation can be utilized as a new cosmological observable that might help us to unveil the nature of current background observations in the nHz band.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the recombination history by combining early and late cosmological probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and apply a new framework for reconstructing the ionization history during the epoch of recombination with combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova data. We find a wide range of ionization histories that are consistent with current CMB data, and also that cosmological parameter constraints are significantly weakened once freedom in recombination is introduced. BAO data partially break the degeneracy between cosmological parameters and the recombination model, and are therefore important in these reconstructions. The 95% confidence upper limits on H0 are 80.1 (70.7) km/s/Mpc given CMB (CMB+BAO) data, assuming no other changes are made to the standard cosmological model. Including Cepheid-calibrated supernova data in the analysis drives a preference for non-standard recombination histories with visibility functions that peak early and exhibit appreciable skewness. Forthcoming measurements from SPT-3G will reduce the uncertainties in our reconstructions by about a factor of two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent result of DESI in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the EoS parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark energy and dark matter is one of modern physics' greatest open problems. Scalar-tensor theories with screened scalar fields like the chameleon model are among the most popular proposed solutions. In this article, we present the first analysis of the impact of a chameleon field on the dynamical Casimir effect, whose main feature is the particle production associated with a resonant condition of boundary periodic motion in cavities. For this, we employ a recently developed method to compute the evolution of confined quantum scalar fields in a globally hyperbolic spacetime by means of time-dependent Bogoliubov transformations. As a result, we show that particle production is reduced due to the presence of the chameleon field. In addition, our results for the Bogoliubov coefficients and the mean number of created particles agree with known results in the absence of a chameleon field. Our results initiate the discussion of the evolution of quantum fields on screened scalar field backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Confusion of extragalactic sources in the far infrared: a baseline assessment of the performance of PRIMAger in intensity and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of their limited angular resolution, far-infrared telescopes are usually affected by confusion phenomenon. Since several galaxies can be located in the same instrumental beam, only the brightest objects emerge from the fluctuations caused by fainter sources. The probe far-infrared mission for astrophysics imager (PRIMAger) will observe the mid- and far-infrared (25-235 $\mu$m) sky both in intensity and polarization. We aim to provide predictions of the confusion level and its consequences for future surveys. We produced simulated PRIMAger maps affected only by the confusion noise using the simulated infrared extragalactic sky (SIDES) semi-empirical simulation. We then estimated the confusion limit in these maps and extracted the sources using a basic blind extractor. By comparing the input galaxy catalog and the extracted source catalog, we derived various performance metrics as completeness, purity, and the accuracy of various measurements. In intensity, we predict that the confusion limit increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. The confusion limit in polarization is more than 100x lower. The measured flux density is dominated by the brightest galaxy in the beam, but other objects also contribute at longer wavelength (~30% at 235 $\mu$m). We also show that galaxy clustering has a mild impact on confusion in intensity (up to 25%), while it is negligible in polarization. In intensity, a basic blind extraction will be sufficient to detect galaxies at the knee of the luminosity function up to z~3 and 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ main-sequence galaxies up to z~5. In polarization for the baseline sensitivity, we expect ~8 000 detections up to z=2.5 opening a totally new window on the high-z dust polarization. Finally, we show that intensity surveys at short wavelength and polarization surveys at long wavelength tend to reach confusion at similar depth. There is thus a strong synergy.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter Gravitationally with Laser Interferometers in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is one of the leading well-motivated dark matter candidates, predicted in many theories beyond the standard model of particle physics and cosmology. There have been increasing interests in searching for ULDM in physical and astronomical experiments, mostly assuming there are additional interactions other than gravity between ULDM and normal matter. Here we demonstrate that even if ULDM has only gravitational interaction, it shall induce gravitational perturbations in solar system that may be large enough to cause detectable signals in future gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers in space. We investigate the sensitivities of Michelson time-delay interferometer to ULDM of various spins, and show vector ULDM with mass $m\lesssim 10^{-18}~$eV can be probed by space-based GW detectors aiming at $\mu$Hz frequencies. Our findings exhibit that GW detectors may directly probe ULDM in some mass ranges that otherwise are challenging to examine.</description>

Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in the minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms in the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with a sufficient number of $e$-foldings and is compatible with the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) Survey: Photometric and Emission Line Data Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present reduced images and catalogues of photometric and emission line data ($\sim$230,000 and $\sim$8,000 sources, respectively) for the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) Survey. These data are made publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) and include reduced images from various facilities: ground-based $ugri$, HST WFC3, and Spitzer IRAC (Infrared Array Camera). Coverage in at least one additional filter beyond the WFC3/IR data are available for roughly half of the fields (227 out of 483), with $\sim$20% (86) having coverage in six or more filters from $u$-band to IRAC 3.6$\mu$m (0.35-3.6$\mu$m). For the lower spatial resolution (and shallower) ground-based and IRAC data, we perform PSF-matched, prior-based, deconfusion photometry (i.e., forced-photometry) using the TPHOT software to optimally extract measurements or upper limits. We present the methodology and software used for the WISP emission line detection and visual inspection. The former adopts a continuous wavelet transformation that significantly reduces the number of spurious sources as candidates before the visual inspection stage. We combine both WISP catalogues and perform SED fitting on galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and multi-band photometry to measure their stellar masses. We stack WISP spectra as functions of stellar mass and redshift and measure average emission line fluxes and ratios. We find that WISP emission line sources are typically `normal' star-forming galaxies based on the Mass-Excitation diagram ([OIII]/H$\beta$ vs. $M_\star$; $0.74&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;2.31$), the galaxy main sequence (SFR vs. $M_\star$; $0.30&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;1.45$), $S_{32}$ ratio vs. $M_\star$ ($0.30&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;0.73$), and $O_{32}$ and $R_{23}$ ratios vs. $M_\star$ ($1.27&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;1.45$).</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>Impact of AGN feedback on the dynamics of gas; A Review across Diverse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review examines the relationship between black hole activity and kinematic gas-star misalignment in brightest group galaxies (BGGs) with different merger rates. The formation history of galaxy groups is assessed through "age-dating" as an indicator of distinct major mergers involving the BGG. BGGs within groups characterized by a higher frequency of major mergers are more likely to host active SMBHs. A consistent correlation is identified between the level of black hole activity, as indicated by the 1.4 GHz and 325 MHz radio emissions, and the degree of kinematic misalignment between the gas and stellar components in BGGs. In dynamically fossil groups, where black hole accretion rate is relatively ($\sim 1$ dex) lower due to the lack of recent ( $\leq 1$ Gyr) major mergers, there is reduced ($\sim$ 30\%) misalignment between the gas and stellar components of BGGs compared to non-fossil groups. Additionally, the study reveals that BGGs in non-fossil groups show higher levels of star formation rate and increased occurrence of mergers, contributing to observed color differences. Exploring the properties and dynamics of the gas disc influenced by mechanical AGN feedback through hydrodynamic simulations suggests that AGN wind-induced effects further lead to persistent gas misalignment of the disk around the supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Australian MWA EoR pipeline I: 21-cm sky model and correlated measurement density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first of two papers dedicated to verifying the Australian Epoch of Reionisation pipeline (AusEoRPipe) through simulation. The AusEoRPipe aims to disentangle 21-cm radiation emitted by gas surrounding the very first stars from contaminating foreground astrophysical sources, and has been in development for close to a decade. In this paper, we build an accurate 21-cm sky model that can be used by the WODEN simulation software to create visibilities containing a predictable 21-cm signal. We verify that the power spectrum estimator CHIPS can recover this signal in the absence of foregrounds. We also investigate how measurements in Fourier-space are correlated, and how their gridded density affects the power spectrum. We measure and fit for this effect using Gaussian-noise simulations of the MWA phase I layout. We find a gridding density correction factor of 2.651 appropriate for integrations equal to or greater than 30 minutes of data, which contain observations with multiple primary beam pointings and LSTs. Paper II of this series will use the results of this paper to test the AusEoRPipe in the presence of foregrounds and instrumental effects.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the ESPRESSO Line-Spread Function and Improvement of the Wavelength Calibration Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving a truly accurate wavelength calibration of high-dispersion echelle spectrographs is a challenging task but crucially needed for certain science cases, e.g. to test for a possible variation of the fine-structure constant in quasar spectra. One of the spectrographs best suited for this mission is VLT/ESPRESSO. Nevertheless, previous studies have identified significant discrepancies between the classical wavelength solutions and the one derived independently from the laser frequency comb. The dominant parts of these systematics were intra-order distortions, most-likely related to a deviation of the instrumental line-spread function from the assumed Gaussian shape. Here, we therefore present a study focused on a detailed modeling of the ESPRESSO instrumental line-spread function. We demonstrate that it is strongly asymmetric, non-Gaussian, different for the two slices and fibers, and varies significantly along the spectral orders. Incorporating the determined non-parametric model in the wavelength calibration process drastically improves the wavelength calibration accuracy, reducing the discrepancies between the two independent wavelength solutions from 50m/s to about 10m/s. The most striking success is, however, that the different fibers and slices now provide fully consistent measurements with a scatter of just a couple m/s. This demonstrates that the instrument-related systematics can be nearly eliminated over most of the spectral range by properly taking into account the complex shape of the instrumental line-spread function and paves the way for further optimizations of the wavelength calibration process.</description>

      <title>Cosmological fluids with boundary term couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological models can be studied effectively using dynamical systems techniques. Starting from Brown's formulation of the variational principle for relativistic fluids, we introduce new types of couplings involving a perfect fluid, a scalar field, and boundary terms. We describe three different coupling models, one of which turns out to be particularly relevant for cosmology. Its behaviour is similar to that of models in which dark matter decays into dark energy. In particular, for a constant coupling, the model mimics well-known dynamical dark energy models while the non-constant couplings offer a rich dynamical structure, unseen before. We are able to achieve this richness whilst working in a two-dimensional phase space. This is a significant advantage which allows us to provide a clear physical interpretation of the key features and draw analogies with previously studied models.</description>

      <title>Second law of horizon thermodynamics during cosmic evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the second law of thermodynamics in the context of horizon cosmology, in particular, whether the change of total entropy (i.e. the sum of the entropy for the apparent horizon and the entropy for the matter fields) proves to be positive with the cosmic expansion of the universe. The matter fields inside the horizon obey the thermodynamics of an open system as the matter fields has a flux through the apparent horizon, which is either outward or inward depending on the background cosmological dynamics. Regarding the entropy of the apparent horizon, we consider different forms of the horizon entropy like the Tsallis entropy, the R\'{e}nyi entropy, the Kaniadakis entropy, or even the 4-parameter generalized entropy; and determine the appropriate conditions on the respective entropic parameters coming from the second law of horizon thermodynamics. The constraints on the entropic parameters are found in such a way that it validates the second law of thermodynamics during a wide range of cosmic era of the universe, particularly from inflation to radiation dominated epoch followed by a reheating stage. Importantly, the present work provides a model independent way to constrain the entropic parameters directly from the second law of thermodynamics for the apparent horizon.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from matter bounce cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from a cubic Weyl action with a non-dynamical coupling are suppressed by the so-called slow-roll parameter in a conventional framework of slow-roll inflation. In this paper, we consider matter bounce cosmology in which the background spacetime is no longer quasi-de Sitter, and hence one might expect that the matter bounce models could predict non-suppressed non-Gaussianities. Nevertheless, we first show that the corresponding non-Gaussian amplitudes from the cubic Weyl term with a non-dynamical coupling are much smaller than those from the conventional slow-roll inflation, in spite of the fact that there is no slow-roll suppression. We then introduce a dynamical coupling that can boost the magnitude of graviton cubic interactions and clarify that there is a parameter region where the tensor non-Gaussianities can be enhanced and can potentially be tested by cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark matter free dwarf galaxy formation at the the tips of the tentacles of jellyfish galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When falling into a galaxy cluster, galaxies experience a loss of gas due to ram pressure stripping. In particular, disk galaxies lose gas from their disks and very large tentacles of gas can be formed. Because of the morphology of these stripped galaxies they have been referred to as Jellyfish galaxies. It has been found that star formation is triggered not only in the disk, but also in the tentacles of such Jellyfish galaxies. The observed star forming regions located in the tentacles of those galaxies have been found to be as massive as $3\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and with sizes $&gt; 100$ pc. Interestingly, these parameters in mass and size agree with those of dwarf galaxies. In this work we make use of the state of the art magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris TNG-50, to study massive jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles. We find that, in the tentacles of TNG-50 Jellyfish galaxies, the star formation regions (gas+stars) formed could be as massive as $\sim2\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. A particular star forming region was analyzed. This region has a star formation rate of $0.04$ M$_{\odot}$/yr, it is metal rich, has an average age of $0.46$ Gyr, and has a half mass radius of $\sim1$ kpc, typical of standard dwarf galaxies. Most importantly, this region is gravitationally self-bound. All and all, we identify a new type of dwarf galaxy being born from the gas tentacles of jellyfish galaxies, that by construction lacks a dark matter (hereafter DM) halo.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Array Harmonic Analysis and Source Angular Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW) influence the arrival times of radio signals coming from pulsars. Here, we investigate the harmonic space approach to describing the pulsar response to a GW. We derive and discuss the "diagonalized form" of the response, which is a sum of spin-2-weighted spherical harmonics of the GW direction multiplied by normal (spin-weight 0) spherical harmonics of the pulsar direction. We show how this allows many useful objects, for example the Hellings and Downs two-point function, to be easily calculated. The approach also provides a clear description of the gauge dependence. We then employ this harmonic approach to model the effects of angular correlations in the sky locations of GW sources (sometimes called "statistical isotropy"). To do this, we construct rotationally invariant ensembles made up of many Gaussian subensembles, each of which breaks rotational invariance. Using harmonic techniques, we compute the cosmic covariance and the total covariance of the Hellings and Downs correlation in these models. The results may be used to assess the impact of angular source correlations on the Hellings and Downs correlation, and for optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs curve in models where GW sources have correlated sky locations.</description>

      <title>GW230529_181500: A Potential Primordial Binary Black Hole Merger in the Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected a coalescing compact binary, GW230529_181500, with component masses of $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ at the $90\%$ credible level. The gravitational-wave data alone is insufficient to determine whether the components are neutron stars or black holes. In this paper, we propose that GW230529_181500 originated from the merger of two primordial black holes (PBHs). We estimate a merger rate of $5.0^{+47.0}_{-4.9} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to GW230529_181500. Assuming the source is a PBH-PBH merger, GW230529-like events lead to approximately $1.7^{+36.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter in the form of PBHs. The required abundance of PBHs to explain this event is consistent with existing upper limits derived from microlensing, cosmic microwave background observations and the null detection of gravitational wave background by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

Abstract: Nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies are ideal targets in the search for indirect dark matter (DM) signals. In this work, we analyze MUSE spectroscopic observations of a sample of five galaxies, composed of both classical and ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals. The goal is to search for radiative decays of axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range of 2.7-5.3 eV. After taking into account the uncertainties associated with the DM spatial distribution in the galaxies, we derive robust bounds on the effective ALP-two-photon coupling. They lie well below the QCD axion band and are significantly more constraining than limits from other probes, in the relevant mass range. We also test the possible presence of a positive signal, concluding that none of the channels selected for this analysis, i.e., not affected by large background contamination, is exhibiting such evidence.</description>

      <title>A full reconstruction of two galaxy clusters intra-cluster medium with strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whilst X-rays and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations allow to study the properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, their gravitational potential may be constrained using strong gravitational lensing. Although being physically related, these two components are often described with different physical models. Here, we present a unified technique to derive the ICM properties from strong lensing for clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to derive this model, we present a new universal and self-similar polytropic temperature profile, which we fit using the X-COP sample of clusters. We subsequently derive an analytical model for the electron density, which we apply to strong lensing clusters MACS J0242.5-2132 and MACS J0949.8+1708. We confront the inferred ICM reconstructions to XMM-Newton and ACT observations. We contrast our analytical electron density reconstructions with the best canonical $\beta$-model. The ICM reconstructions obtained prove to be compatible with observations. However they appear to be very sensitive to various dark matter halo parameters constrained through strong lensing (such as the core radius), and to the halo scale radius (fixed in the lensing optimisations). With respect to the important baryonic effects, we make the sensitivity on the scale radius of the reconstruction an asset, and use the inferred potential to constrain the dark matter density profile using ICM observations. The technique here developed should allow to take a new, and more holistic path to constrain the content of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>ICM-SHOX. Paper I: Methodology overview and discovery of a gas--dark matter velocity decoupling in the MACS J0018.5+1626 merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers are rich sources of information to test cluster astrophysics and cosmology. However, cluster mergers produce complex projected signals that are difficult to interpret physically from individual observational probes. Multi-probe constraints on the gas and dark matter cluster components are necessary to infer merger parameters that are otherwise degenerate. We present ICM-SHOX (Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray), a systematic framework to jointly infer multiple merger parameters quantitatively via a pipeline that directly compares a novel combination of multi-probe observables to mock observables derived from hydrodynamical simulations. We report a first application of the ICM-SHOX pipeline to MACS J0018.5+1626, wherein we systematically examine simulated snapshots characterized by a wide range of initial parameters to constrain the MACS J0018.5+1626 merger geometry. We constrain the epoch of MACS J0018.5+1626 to the range $0$--$60$ Myr post-pericenter passage, and the viewing angle is inclined $\approx 27$--$40$ degrees from the merger axis. We obtain constraints for the impact parameter ($\lesssim 250$ kpc), mass ratio ($\approx 1.5$--$3.0$), and initial relative velocity when the clusters are separated by 3 Mpc ($\approx 1700$--3000 km s$^{-1}$). The primary and secondary clusters initially (at 3 Mpc) have gas distributions that are moderately and strongly disturbed, respectively. We discover a velocity space decoupling of the dark matter and gas distributions in MACS J0018.5+1626, traced by cluster-member galaxy velocities and the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, respectively. Our simulations indicate this decoupling is dependent on the different collisional properties of the two distributions for particular merger epochs, geometries, and viewing angles.</description>

Abstract: In 2015, the Planck Collaboration released an all-sky map of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, obtained by implementing the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) method on the Planck PR2 data. The quality of the Planck data has significantly improved since then. The Planck PR4 data release offers upgraded full-sky maps in the LFI and HFI frequency bands with improved systematics and sensitivity. We present a new all-sky thermal SZ Compton $y$-parameter map derived from the Planck PR4 data using NILC and highlight improvements, particularly in noise reduction and handling residual foreground contamination. The PR4 NILC Compton $y$-parameter map has been made publicly available to support further analyses.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the origin of the radio synchrotron background via angular correlations</title>

Abstract: The origin of the radio synchrotron background (RSB) is currently unknown. Its understanding might have profound implications in fundamental physics or might reveal a new class of radio emitters. In this work, we consider the scenario in which the RSB is due to extragalactic radio sources and measure the angular cross-correlation of LOFAR images of the diffuse radio sky with matter tracers at different redshifts, provided by galaxy catalogs and CMB lensing. We compare these measured cross-correlations to those expected for models of RSB sources. We find that low-redshift populations of discrete sources are excluded by the data, while higher redshift explanations are compatible with available observations. We also conclude that at least 20\% of the RSB surface brightness level must originate from populations tracing the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe, indicating that at least this fraction of the RSB is of extragalactic origin. Future measurements of the correlation between the RSB and tracers of high-redshift sources will be crucial to constraining the source population of the RSB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated analysis of eleven cosmological models that may help reduce the Hubble tension, which now reaches the $6\sigma$ level when considering the latest SH0ES measurement versus recent CMB and BAO data, assuming $\Lambda$CDM. Specifically, we look at five classical extensions of $\Lambda$CDM (with massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, free-streaming or self-interacting relativistic relics, or dynamical dark energy) and six elaborate models featuring either a time-varying electron mass, early dark energy or some non-trivial interactions in the neutrino sector triggered by a light Majoron. We improve over previous works in several ways. We include the latest data from the South Pole Telescope as well as the most recent measurement of the Hubble rate by the SH0ES collaboration. We treat the summed neutrino mass as a free parameter in most of our models, which reveals interesting degeneracies and constraints. We define additional metrics to assess the potential of a model to reduce or even solve the Hubble tension. We validate an emulator that uses active learning to train itself during each parameter inference run for any arbitrary model. We find that the time-varying electron mass and the Majoron models are now ruled out at more than $3\sigma$. Models with a time-varying electron mass and spatial curvature or with early dark energy reduce the tension to $1.0-2.9\sigma$. Nevertheless, none of the models considered in this work is favored with enough statistical significance to become the next concordance model of Cosmology.</description>

      <title>From inflation to dark matter halo profiles: the impact of primordial non-Gaussianities on the central density cusp</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that local primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) with significant amplitude ($|f_{\rm NL}| \sim 1000$), at small (Mpc) scales, can help in forming simulated galaxies with more disky baryonic kinematics than in the Gaussian case, while generating matter power spectra that can differ by up to 20% from the Gaussian case at non-linear scales. Here, we explore in detail the consequences of such small-scale PNG on the dark matter halo profiles. We show in particular that, for negative $f_{\rm NL}$, dark matter halos formed in collisionless simulations are not always well described by the traditional Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles, as supported by their sparsity distribution. We conclude that NFW profiles are not as clear attractors for the density profiles of dark matter halos in the presence of PNG than in the case of a Gaussian contrast density field. We show how alternatives to the NFW profile can describe halos both in the Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases. From the combination of our sparsity analysis and the quality of the adjustments of the density profiles with a minimal extension to NFW, we conclude that $z=1$ halos carry the most interesting information about PNG</description>

Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Using Axion Miniclusters to Disentangle the Axion-photon Coupling and the Dark Matter Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter direct (and indirect) detection experiments usually can only determine a specific combination of a power of the coupling and the dark matter density. This is also true for axion haloscopes which are sensitive to the product $g^{2}_{a\gamma\gamma}\rho_{\rm DM}$, the combination of axion-photon coupling squared and the dark matter density. In this note we show, that in the lucky case when we intersect with a so-called axion minicluster of a suitable size, we can utilize the spectral information available in haloscopes to determine the gravitational potential of the minicluster. We can then use this to measure separately the coupling and the density of the minicluster.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Black Hole Ringdowns: an Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the nature of gravity, non-linear effects are left imprinted in the quasi-normal modes generated in the ringdown phase of the merger of two black holes. We offer an analytical treatment of the quasi-normal modes at second-order in black hole perturbation theory which takes advantage from the fact that the non-linear sources are peaked around the light ring. As a byproduct, we describe why the amplitude of the second-order mode relative to the square of the first-order amplitude depends only weakly on the initial condition of the problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral Libraries for Analyzing Spectra of Low-Metalicity Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a set of isochrone-tailored spectral libraries for analyzing composite spectra of low-metallicity massive star clusters or starburst galaxies. Specifically, we have computed non-LTE spectra for stars of all initial masses for isochrones at metallicities, Z=0.006, 0.002,and 0.0004, with and without considering rotation. These isochrones were constructed by the Geneva group (Ekstr\"{o}m et al., 2011; Georgy et al., 2013; Groh et al., 2019; Eggenberger et al. 2020). We also present a Python program for integrating individual spectra for an arbitrary initial mass function.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Kalb-Ramond-Like-Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalb-Ramond field is an antisymmetric, rank-two tensor field which most notably appears in the context of string theory, but has largely been unexplored in the context of cosmology. In this work, motivated by the Kalb-Ramond field in string theory, and antisymmetric tensor fields that emerge in effective field theories ranging from particle physics to condensed matter, we study the primordial production of interacting massive Kalb-Ramond-like-particles (KRLPs). KRLPs contain features of both dark photon and axion models, which can be appreciated via their duality properties. While the massless non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudoscalar, and the massive non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudovector, the interacting massive KRLP can be distinguished from its scalar and vector counterparts. We study early-universe production of KRLPs via the freeze-in mechanism, considering a `dark photon-like' interaction, an `axion-like' interaction, and a `Higgs portal' interaction, as well as production via cosmological gravitational particle production. We find that as a dark matter candidate, KRLPs can be produced by all of the above mechanisms and account for the relic density of dark matter today for a wide range of masses. Finally, we comment on the potential to obtain both warm and cold dark matter subcomponents, and speculate on observational and experimental prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scenario with axions/axion-like particles Chern-Simons gravity coupling, such that gravitational waves can be produced directly from axion wave parametric resonance in the early universe after inflation. This axion gravity term is less constrained compared to the well-searched axion photon coupling and can provide a direct and efficient production channel for gravitational waves. Such stochastic gravitational waves can be detected by either space/ground-based gravitational wave detectors or pulsar timing arrays for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the dark matter in the Universe is made of $\mu$eV axion-like particles (ALPs), then a rich phenomenology can emerge in connection to their stimulated decay into two photons. We discuss the ALP stimulated decay induced by electromagnetic radiation from Galactic radio sources. Three signatures, made by two echoes and one collinear emission, are associated with the decay, and can be simultaneously detected, offering a unique opportunity for a clear ALP identification. We derive the formalism associated with such signatures starting from first principles, and providing the relevant equations to be applied to study the ALP phenomenology. We then focus on the case of Galactic pulsars as stimulating sources and derive forecasts for future observations, which will be complementary to helioscopes and haloscopes results</description>

      <title>Extracting Halo Independent Information from Dark Matter Electron Scattering Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments and the interpretation of their results are sensitive to the velocity structure of the dark matter in our galactic halo. In this work, we extend the formalism that deals with such astrophysics-driven uncertainties, originally introduced in the context of dark-matter-nuclear scattering, to include dark-matter-electron scattering interactions. Using mock data, we demonstrate that the ability to determine the correct dark matter mass and velocity distribution is depleted for recoil spectra which only populate a few low-lying bins, such as models involving a light mediator. We also demonstrate how this formalism allows one to test the compatibility of existing experimental data sets (e.g. SENSEI and EDELWEISS), as well as make predictions for possible future experiments (e.g. GaAs-based detectors).</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave populations and cosmology with neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply neural posterior estimation for fast-and-accurate hierarchical Bayesian inference of gravitational wave populations. We use a normalizing flow to estimate directly the population hyper-parameters from a collection of individual source observations. This approach provides complete freedom in event representation, automatic inclusion of selection effects, and (in contrast to likelihood estimation) without the need for stochastic samplers to obtain posterior samples. Since the number of events may be unknown when the network is trained, we split into sub-population analyses that we later recombine; this allows for fast sequential analyses as additional events are observed. We demonstrate our method on a toy problem of dark siren cosmology, and show that inference takes just a few minutes and scales to $\sim 600$ events before performance degrades. We argue that neural posterior estimation therefore represents a promising avenue for population inference with large numbers of events.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from JWST and NANOGrav</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the recent statistics of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently -- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.</description>

      <title>Is GN-z11 powered by a super-Eddington massive black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of $z \sim 6$ quasars powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10}\, M_\odot$) challenge our current understanding of early black hole (BH) formation and evolution. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the study of massive BHs (MBHs; $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{6-7} \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$) up to $z\sim 11$, thus bridging the properties of $z\sim 6$ quasars to their ancestors. The JWST spectroscopic observations of GN-z11, a well-known $z=10.6$ star-forming galaxy, have been interpreted with the presence of a super-Eddington (Eddington ratio $\equiv \,\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim 5.5$) accreting MBH. To test this hypothesis, we used a zoom-in cosmological simulation of galaxy formation and BH co-evolution. We first tested the simulation results against the observed probability distribution function (PDF) of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ found in $z\sim 6$ quasars. Then, in the simulation we selected the BHs that satisfy the following criteria: (a) $10 &lt; z &lt; 11 $, (b) $M_{\rm BH} &gt; 10^6 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Next, we apply the extreme value statistics to the PDF of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ resulting from the simulation and we find that the probability of observing a $z\sim 10-11$ MBH accreting with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5.5$ in the volume surveyed by JWST is very low ($&lt;0.2\%$). We compared our predictions with those in the literature, and discuss the main limitations of our work. Our simulation cannot explain the JWST observations of GN-z11. This might be due to (i) poor resolution and statistics in simulations, (ii) simplistic sub-grid models (e.g. BH accretion and seeding), (iii) uncertainties in the data analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the collision scenario of the dissociative galaxy cluster Abell 56 through hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In galaxy cluster collisions, the gas can be separated from dark matter halos. Abell~56 displays signatures of a dissociative bullet-like merger with a possible high inclination angle between the plane of orbit and the sky. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive description of the features observed in the collision scenario of Abell~56. Additionally, we aim to apply a potential weak lensing mass bias correction attributed to the merger to evaluate its impact on our findings. To investigate this, we perform tailored hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations, varying the impact parameter. We initially identified an early scenario at $0.12$\,Gyr after the central passage that reproduces some observational features. However, the mean temperature of $9.7$\,keV exceeded the observed value. Our best model corresponds to the late scenario at $0.52$\,Gyr after the pericenter, reproducing observed features of Abell~56, with an inclination of $58^\circ$. These features include the offset of $103$\,kpc between the main gas density peak and the south dark matter density peak, gas morphology, a line of sight relative velocity of $184$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, and a mean temperature of $6.7$\,keV. This late model provides a plausible scenario to describe the dynamics of Abell~56. The weak lensing mass bias did not significantly impact the overall dynamics of this cluster merger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An outstanding mystery of dark matter physics is the lack of direct detection signals to date. We suggest that dark matter is scatophobic: due to a repulsive long-range interaction, it is repelled by objects with a large net scat charge, such as the Earth, and is therefore not able to reach direct detection experiments. This represents the first step in a broader theoretical paradigm that we dub the "anti-anthropic principle."</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of modified gravity in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a fundamental flaw in the application of modified gravity theories in cosmology, taking $f(R)$ gravity as a paradigmatic example. This theory contains a scalar degree of freedom that couples to the matter stress-energy tensor but not to gravitational energy. However, when applied to cosmology this theory is unable to distinguish between gravitational and non-gravitational energy. Hence the cosmological version of the theory does not coincide with its own macroscopic average, and we show that this leads to order-one discrepancies. We argue that the same inconsistency is common to many other modified gravity theories with extra degrees of freedom. Our results put into question whether these theories can make sense as the cosmological average of a fundamental theory, hence challenging their physical significance.</description>

      <title>A complex node of the cosmic web associated with the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0600.1-2008</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MACS J0600.1-2008 (MACS0600) is an X-ray luminous, massive galaxy cluster at $z_{\mathrm{d}}=0.43$, studied previously as part of the REionization LensIng Cluster Survey (RELICS) and ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) projects which revealed a complex, bimodal mass distribution and an intriguing high-redshift object behind it. Here, we report on the results of an extended strong-lensing (SL) analysis of this system. Using new JWST and ground-based Gemini-N and Keck data, we obtain 13 new spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged galaxies and identify 12 new photometric multiple-image systems and candidates, including two multiply imaged $z\sim7$ objects. Taking advantage of the larger areal coverage, our analysis reveals a new bimodal, massive SL structure adjacent to the cluster which we measure spectroscopically to lie at the same redshift and whose existence was implied by previous SL-modeling analyses. While based in part on photometric systems identified in ground-based imaging requiring further verification, our extended SL model suggests that the cluster may have the second-largest critical area and effective Einstein radius observed to date, $A_{\mathrm{crit}}\simeq2.16\,\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{E}}=49.7''\pm5.0''$ for a source at $z_{\mathrm{s}}=2$, enclosing a total mass of $M(&lt;\theta_{\mathrm{E}})=(4.7\pm0.7)\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Yet another, probably related massive cluster structure, discovered in X-rays $5'$ (1.7 Mpc) further north, suggests that MACS0600 is in fact part of an even larger filamentary structure. This discovery adds to several recent detections of massive structures around SL galaxy clusters and establishes MACS0600 as a prime target for future high-redshift surveys with JWST.</description>
