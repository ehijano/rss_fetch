      <title>Sequencing Silicates in the IRS Debris Disk Catalog I: Methodology for Unsupervised Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris disks, which consist of dust, planetesimals, planets, and gas, offer a unique window into the mineralogical composition of their parent bodies, especially during the critical phase of terrestrial planet formation spanning 10 to a few hundred million years. Observations from the $\textit{Spitzer}$ Space Telescope have unveiled thousands of debris disks, yet systematic studies remain scarce, let alone those with unsupervised clustering techniques. This study introduces $\texttt{CLUES}$ (CLustering UnsupErvised with Sequencer), a novel, non-parametric, fully-interpretable machine-learning spectral analysis tool designed to analyze and classify the spectral data of debris disks. $\texttt{CLUES}$ combines multiple unsupervised clustering methods with multi-scale distance measures to discern new groupings and trends, offering insights into compositional diversity and geophysical processes within these disks. Our analysis allows us to explore a vast parameter space in debris disk mineralogy and also offers broader applications in fields such as protoplanetary disks and solar system objects. This paper details the methodology, implementation, and initial results of $\texttt{CLUES}$, setting the stage for more detailed follow-up studies focusing on debris disk mineralogy and demographics.</description>

      <title>TOI-421 b: A Hot Sub-Neptune with a Haze-Free, Low Mean Molecular Weight Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common features of sub-Neptunes atmospheres observed to date include signatures of aerosols at moderate equilibrium temperatures (~500-800 K), and a prevalence of high mean molecular weight atmospheres, perhaps indicating novel classes of planets such as water worlds. Here we present a 0.83-5 micron JWST transmission spectrum of the sub-Neptune TOI-421 b. This planet is unique among previously observed counterparts in its high equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \approx 920$) and its Sun-like host star. We find marked differences between the atmosphere of TOI-421 b and those of sub-Neptunes previously characterized with JWST, which all orbit M stars. Specifically, water features in the NIRISS/SOSS bandpass indicate a low mean molecular weight atmosphere consistent with solar metallicity, and no appreciable aerosol coverage. Hints of SO$_2$ and CO (but not CO$_2$ or CH$_4$) also exist in our NIRSpec/G395M observations, but not at sufficient signal-to-noise to draw firm conclusions. Our results support a picture in which sub-Neptunes hotter than ~850 K do not form hydrocarbon hazes due to a lack of methane to photolyze. TOI-421 b additionally fits the paradigm of the radius valley for planets orbiting FGK stars being sculpted by mass loss processes, which would leave behind primordial atmospheres overlying rock/iron interiors. Further observations of TOI-421 b and similar hot sub-Neptunes will confirm whether haze-free atmospheres and low mean molecular weights are universal characteristics of such objects.</description>

      <title>Photometry of outer Solar System objects from the Dark Energy Survey II: a joint analysis of trans-Neptunian absolute magnitudes, colors, lightcurves and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the 696 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with absolute magnitudes $5.5 &lt; H_r &lt; 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely $H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity. We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright'' (NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$ and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey IV. Unveiling the carbon isotope ratio of GQ Lup B and its host star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbon isotope ratio ($^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$) is a potential tracer of giant planet and brown dwarf formation. The GQ Lup system, hosting the K7 T Tauri star GQ Lup A and its substellar companion GQ Lup B, offers a unique opportunity to investigate this ratio in a young system. We aim to characterise the atmosphere of GQ Lup B, determining its temperature, chemical composition, spin, surface gravity, and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$, while also measuring the same ratio for its host star, GQ Lup A. High-resolution K-band spectra of GQ Lup were obtained using CRIRES+ at the VLT. We modelled the starlight contribution from GQ Lup A and fitted GQ Lup B\'s spectrum with atmospheric models from petitRADTRANS. The $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio for GQ Lup A was derived using isotope-sensitive PHOENIX models. Atmospheric analysis of GQ Lup B revealed abundances of H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HF, Na, Ca, and Ti, along with a C/O ratio of $0.50 \pm 0.01$, consistent with the solar value. The carbon isotope ratio was measured as $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 53^{+7}_{-6}$ for GQ Lup B and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 51^{+10}_{-8}$ for GQ Lup A. Strong veiling of the photospheric lines of GQ Lup A was identified and accounted for. The similar $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ values in GQ Lup A and B suggest a common origin from a shared material reservoir, supporting formation via disc fragmentation or gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Detection via Differentiable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is crucial for advancing our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system, but it faces significant challenges due to the high contrast between host stars and their planets. Wavefront aberrations introduce speckles in the telescope science images, which are patterns of diffracted starlight that can mimic the appearance of planets, complicating the detection of faint exoplanet signals. Traditional post-processing methods, operating primarily in the image intensity domain, do not integrate wavefront sensing data. These data, measured mainly for adaptive optics corrections, have been overlooked as a potential resource for post-processing, partly due to the challenge of the evolving nature of wavefront aberrations. In this paper, we present a differentiable rendering approach that leverages these wavefront sensing data to improve exoplanet detection. Our differentiable renderer models wave-based light propagation through a coronagraphic telescope system, allowing gradient-based optimization to significantly improve starlight subtraction and increase sensitivity to faint exoplanets. Simulation experiments based on the James Webb Space Telescope configuration demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial improvements in contrast and planet detection limits. Our results showcase how the computational advancements enabled by differentiable rendering can revitalize previously underexploited wavefront data, opening new avenues for enhancing exoplanet imaging and characterization.</description>

      <title>Stellar Physics and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model. This surprising result is reviewed including brief discussion of physics behind the discrepancy and a new application of the new mass formula to gas planets.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering From the Sun and Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that massless waves should scatter from the Riemann curvature of their backgrounds. These scattered waves are sometimes called $\textit{tails}$ and have never been directly observed. Here we calculate the gravitational waves scattered in the backward direction (scattering angle $\vartheta=\pi$) from the weak-field curvature of an extended massive object, finding close agreement with previous results in the long-wavelength limit. These long-wavelength results are then applied to gravitational waves in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) sensitivity band scattering from the Sun and planets. We estimate that scattering from the Sun and the planets from Jupiter to Neptune could contribute a $10^{-3}$ amplitude modulation to LISA observations when these objects almost intersect the line of sight between LISA and the source, leading to forward scattering with $\vartheta\simeq0$. These conditions should be realized for the Sun during the lifetime of LISA if the detection rate of long-duration sources is not much smaller than a thousand per year.</description>

      <title>Cleaning WASP-33 b transits from the host star photometric variability: analysis of TESS data from two sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$ Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33 b transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$ s to $18$ s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed previously based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

      <title>Promise and Peril: Stellar Contamination and Strict Limits on the Atmosphere Composition of TRAPPIST-1c from JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attempts to probe the atmospheres of rocky planets around M dwarfs present both promise and peril. While their favorable planet-to-star radius ratios enable searches for even thin secondary atmospheres, their high activity levels and high-energy outputs threaten atmosphere survival. Here, we present the 0.6--2.85\,$\mu$m transmission spectrum of the 1.1\,$\rm R_\oplus$, $\sim$340\,K rocky planet TRAPPIST-1\,c obtained over two JWST NIRISS/SOSS transit observations. Each of the two spectra displays 100--500\,ppm signatures of stellar contamination. Despite being separated by 367\,days, the retrieved spot and faculae properties are consistent between the two visits, resulting in nearly identical transmission spectra. Jointly retrieving for stellar contamination and a planetary atmosphere reveals that our spectrum can rule out hydrogen-dominated, $\lesssim$300$\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres with effective surface pressures down to 10\,mbar at the 3-$\sigma$ level. For high-mean molecular weight atmospheres, where O$_2$ or N$_2$ is the background gas, our spectrum disfavors partial pressures of more than $\sim$10\,mbar for H$_2$O, CO, NH$_3$ and CH$_4$ at the 2-$\sigma$ level. Similarly, under the assumption of a 100\% H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CO, or CH$_4$ atmosphere, our spectrum disfavors thick, $&gt;$1\,bar atmospheres at the 2-$\sigma$ level. These non-detections of spectral features are in line with predictions that even heavier, CO$_2$-rich, atmospheres would be efficiently lost on TRAPPIST-1\,c given the cumulative high-energy irradiation experienced by the planet. Our results further stress the importance of robustly accounting for stellar contamination when analyzing JWST observations of exo-Earths around M dwarfs, as well as the need for high-fidelity stellar models to search for the potential signals of thin secondary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>
