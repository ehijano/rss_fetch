      <title>Frustration, dynamics and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Partial SMILES Validation Scheme for Enhanced Drug Design in Reinforcement Learning Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM) has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\% during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</description>
