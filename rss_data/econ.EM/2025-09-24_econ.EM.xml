      <title>Optimal estimation for regression discontinuity design with binary outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a finite-sample optimal estimator for regression discontinuity designs when the outcomes are bounded, including binary outcomes as the leading case. Our finite-sample optimal estimator achieves the exact minimax mean squared error among linear shrinkage estimators with nonnegative weights when the regression function of a bounded outcome lies in a Lipschitz class. Although the original minimax problem involves an iterating (n+1)-dimensional non-convex optimization problem where n is the sample size, we show that our estimator is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. A key advantage of our estimator is that the Lipschitz constant is the only tuning parameter. We also propose a uniformly valid inference procedure without a large-sample approximation. In a simulation exercise for small samples, our estimator exhibits smaller mean squared errors and shorter confidence intervals than conventional large-sample techniques which may be unreliable when the effective sample size is small. We apply our method to an empirical multi-cutoff design where the sample size for each cutoff is small. In the application, our method yields informative confidence intervals, in contrast to the leading large-sample approach.</description>

      <title>Driver Identification and PCA Augmented Selection Shrinkage Framework for Nordic System Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The System Price (SP) of the Nordic electricity market serves as a key reference for financial hedge contracts such as Electricity Price Area Differentials (EPADs) and other risk management instruments. Therefore, the identification of drivers and the accurate forecasting of SP are essential for market participants to design effective hedging strategies. This paper develops a systematic framework that combines interpretable drivers analysis with robust forecasting methods. It proposes an interpretable feature engineering algorithm to identify the main drivers of the Nordic SP based on a novel combination of K-means clustering, Multiple Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (MSTD), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. Then, it applies principal component analysis (PCA) to the identified data matrix, which is adapted to the downstream task of price forecasting to mitigate the issue of imperfect multicollinearity in the data. Finally, we propose a multi-forecast selection-shrinkage algorithm for Nordic SP forecasting, which selects a subset of complementary forecast models based on their bias-variance tradeoff at the ensemble level and then computes the optimal weights for the retained forecast models to minimize the error variance of the combined forecast. Using historical data from the Nordic electricity market, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms individual input models uniformly, robustly, and significantly, while maintaining a comparable computational cost. Notably, our systematic framework produces superior results using simple input models, outperforming the state-of-the-art Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Furthermore, we show that our approach also exceeds the performance of several well-established practical forecast combination methods.</description>

      <title>Filtering amplitude dependence of correlation dynamics in complex systems: application to the cryptocurrency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the cryptocurrency market dynamics, this study presents a general methodology for analyzing evolving correlation structures in complex systems using the $q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient \rho(q,s). By extending traditional metrics, this approach captures correlations at varying fluctuation amplitudes and time scales. The method employs $q$-dependent minimum spanning trees ($q$MSTs) to visualize evolving network structures. Using minute-by-minute exchange rate data for 140 cryptocurrencies on Binance (Jan 2021-Oct 2024), a rolling window analysis reveals significant shifts in $q$MSTs, notably around April 2022 during the Terra/Luna crash. Initially centralized around Bitcoin (BTC), the network later decentralized, with Ethereum (ETH) and others gaining prominence. Spectral analysis confirms BTC's declining dominance and increased diversification among assets. A key finding is that medium-scale fluctuations exhibit stronger correlations than large-scale ones, with $q$MSTs based on the latter being more decentralized. Properly exploiting such facts may offer the possibility of a more flexible optimal portfolio construction. Distance metrics highlight that major disruptions amplify correlation differences, leading to fully decentralized structures during crashes. These results demonstrate $q$MSTs' effectiveness in uncovering fluctuation-dependent correlations, with potential applications beyond finance, including biology, social and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Cointegration with Occasionally Binding Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature on nonlinear cointegration, a long-standing open problem relates to how a (nonlinear) vector autoregression, which provides a unified description of the short- and long-run dynamics of a vector of time series, can generate 'nonlinear cointegration' in the profound sense of those series sharing common nonlinear stochastic trends. We consider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural VAR (CKSVAR), which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within which to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities, such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model, via unit roots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions, providing the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theorem to a nonlinearly cointegrated setting, and thereby giving the first successful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes include regulated, censored and kinked Brownian motions, none of which have previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results and running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a far richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR, in ways that may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Quasi-randomization tests for network interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network interference amounts to the treatment status of one unit affecting the potential outcome of other units in the population. Testing for spillover effects in this setting makes the null hypothesis non-sharp. An interesting approach to tackling the non-sharp nature of the null hypothesis in this setup is constructing conditional randomization tests such that the null is sharp on the restricted population. In randomized experiments, conditional randomized tests hold finite sample validity and are assumption-lean. In this paper, we incorporate the network amongst the population as a random variable instead of being fixed. We propose a new approach that builds a conditional quasi-randomization test. To build the (non-sharp) null distribution of no spillover effects, we use random graph null models. We show that our method is exactly valid in finite samples under mild assumptions. Our method displays enhanced power over state-of-the-art methods, with a substantial improvement in cluster randomized trials. We illustrate our methodology to test for interference in a weather insurance adoption experiment run in rural China.</description>
