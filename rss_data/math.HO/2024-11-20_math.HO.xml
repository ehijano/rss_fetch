      <title>Scattered polynomials: an overview on their properties, connections and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to outline the state of the art in research on a class of linearized polynomials with coefficients over finite fields, known as scattered polynomials. These have been studied in several contexts, such as in [A. Blokhuis, M. Lavrauw. Scattered spaces with respect to a spread in $\mathrm{PG}(n, q)$. Geometriae Dedicata 81(1) (2000), 231-243] and [G. Lunardon, O. Polverino. Blocking sets and derivable partial spreads. J. Algebraic Combin. 14 (2001), 49-56]. Recently, their connection to maximum rank-metric codes was brought to light in [J. Sheekey. MRD codes: Constructions and connections. In K.-U. Schmidt and A. Winterhof, editors, Combinatorics and Finite Fields, De Gruyter (2019), 255-286]. This link has significantly advanced their study and investigation, sparking considerable interest in recent years. Here, we will explore their relationship with certain subsets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ known as maximum scattered linear sets, as well as with codes made up of square matrices of order $n$ equipped with the rank metric. We will review the known examples of scattered polynomials up to date and discuss some of their key properties. We will also address the classification of maximum scattered linear sets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ for small values of $n$ and discuss characterization results for the examples known so far. Finally, we will retrace how each scattered polynomial gives rise to a translation plane, as discussed in [V. Casarino, G. Longobardi, C. Zanella. Scattered linear sets in a finite projective line and translation planes, Linear Algebra Appl. 650 (2022), 286-298] and in [G. Longobardi, C. Zanella, A standard form for scattered linearized polynomials and properties of the related translation planes, J. Algebr. Comb. 59(4) (2024), 917-937].</description>

      <title>A Course of Algebra (PART I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following is an exposition of a course of algebra that Prof. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Zykov (1922-2013) distributed among the participants of his seminar in graph theory not far away from Odessa, Ukraine, on September, 1991. It is a privilege for me to be able to reproduce, with some good additions, the English version of this remarkable course that he designed carefully over several years with the help of other colleagues and with the only purpose of making the science of algebra more accessible to the less gifted student. Prof. Zykov was an admirable person and a very clever mathematician and scientist. His scientific interests were wide: from the mathematical sciences at any level and in any of their branches to the theory of relativity as I recall. He kindly wrote a review recommending the results of my doctoral dissertation, which was necessary for the approval to obtain a Ph.D. degree during the meeting of my defense. In that meeting, I was very nervous because I had in front of me fifteen professors all of them doctors of technical or mathematical sciences asking all sort of questions and whom I had to convince of the fact that my results were true. I am sure this algebra course played the role that Prof. Zykov, with his deepness of thought, had primarily intended, that is, one course designed with the right approach to help out many of his students.</description>

      <title>Recent advances on minimal codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short survey we concern ourselves with minimal codes, a classical object in coding theory. We will explain the relation between minimal codes and various other mathematical domains, in particular with finite projective geometry. This latter connection has sparked a renewed interest in minimal codes, giving rise to new constructions as well as new questions.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Formal Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive proof assistants make it possible for ordinary mathematicians to write definitions and theorems in a formal proof language, like a programming language, so that a computer can parse them and check them against the rules of a formal axiomatic foundation. This article describes the experience of working with a proof assistant and considers the impact the technology will have on mathematics.</description>

      <title>On some geometric interpretations of fractional-order operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This discussion paper presents some parts of the work in progress. It is shown that G.W. Leibniz was the first who raised the question about geometric interpretation of fractional-order operators. Geometric interpretations of the Riemann--Liouville fractional integral and the Stieltjes integral are explained. Then, for the first time, a geometric interpretation of the Stieltjes derivatives is introduced, which holds also for so-called ``fractal derivatives'', which are a particular case of Stieltjes derivatives.</description>
