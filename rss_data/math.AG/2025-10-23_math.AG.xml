      <title>The abelian fundamental group with modulus in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the abelian fundamental group with modulus of a regular flat scheme over a discrete valuation ring, taking into account wild ramification along a divisor. Our definition provides a mixed-characteristic analogue of the abelian fundamental group with modulus introduced by Kerz--Saito for smooth schemes over a perfect field. In this setting, we prove a Lefschetz-type theorem for strictly semi-stable schemes: restriction to a hypersurface of sufficiently large degree relative to the ramification induces an isomorphism of the abelian fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>Tyurin Degenerations, Derived Lagrangians and Categorification of DT Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the moduli space of rigidified perfect complexes with support on a general complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ and its Tyurin degeneration $X\rightsquigarrow X_1\cup_SX_2$ to a complete intersection of Fano threefolds $X_1,X_2$ meeting along their anti-canonical divisor $S$. The corresponding derived dg moduli scheme over the generic fiber degenerates to the (Fano) moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{1}, \mathcal{M}_{2},$ of perfect complexes supported on each Fano which glue after derived restriction to the relative divisor $S$. We prove that the total moduli space of the degeneration family carries a relative Lagrangian foliation structure, which implies the existence of a flat Gauss-Manin connection on periodic cyclic homology of the category of the matrix factorizations associated with fiber-wise moduli spaces, realized locally as the derived critical loci of suitable potential functions. The Fano moduli spaces each define derived Lagrangians in the (ambient) moduli space of restricted complexes to the relative divisor $S$. The flatness of the Gauss-Manin connection implies the derived geometric deformation invariance of the categorified DT-invariants associated to fiberwise matrix factorization categories, hence, the categorified DT-invariants of the generic fiber are expressed in terms of a derived intersection cohomology of the corresponding Fano moduli spaces on the special fiber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct universal Brauer-Severi varieties of fixed period and index and study their geometry. We determine their cohomology and their Brauer and Picard groups and show that they are almost always simply connected. As an application, we reinterpret the discriminant avoidance result of de Jong and Starr in terms of universal Brauer-Severi varieties.</description>

      <title>Motivic p-adic periods of 1-motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit construction of the p-adic de Rham comparison isomorphism for 1-motives. In particular, we prove that our construction recovers the classical de Rham comparison isomorphism and is functorial with respect to morphisms of rigid 1-motives. In the second part, we construct a new ring of motivic p-adic periods using the formalism of rigid analytic motives. Furthermore, we explain the relation between these motivic periods and the periods of the classical p-adic de Rham comparison isomorphism. Finally, we apply our construction to explicitly compute the period pairing for several examples of 1-motives and curves.</description>

      <title>On Casagrande-Druel Fano varieties with Lefschetz defect 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The larger the Lefschetz defect delta(X) of a smooth complex Fano variety X, the more information we can deduce about the geometry of X. The structure of varieties with delta(X) greater than 2 is known. In this paper, we study the case delta(X)=2. In particular, we focus on Fano varieties with delta(X)=2 arising from the so called Casagrande-Druel construction, which we refer to as Construction A. We show that among the 19 families of Fano 3-folds with delta(X)=2 classified by Mori and Mukai, 15 arise from such construction. Moreover, we construct all Fano 4-folds with Picard number greater than 3 and delta(X)=2 admitting such a structure, obtaining 147 distinct families in total. This completes the classification of all Casagrande-Druel Fano 4-folds with delta(X)=2. To broaden the scope, we also study a generalized version of Construction A, which we call Construction B, and we show that 18 out of the 19 families of Fano 3-folds with delta(X)=2 arise from it.</description>

      <title>Regular Leaves of Singular Foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a class of singular algebraic foliations whose leaves through singular points retain regularity. The proof consists in showing existence of residual gerbes for certain formal stacks, which do not enjoy smooth presentations. As applications, we extend a theorem of Cerveau to the case where the ambient scheme is not smooth and we give a proof of the Zariski--Lipman conjecture for varieties with terminal singularities, which does not rely on existence of resolution of singularities.</description>

      <title>Analytical Traces on Coulomb Branches of Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit construction of twisted traces for quantum Coulomb branches of conical theories. We develop an operator representation of the Coulomb branch algebra and use it to derive integral formulas for the twisted trace. Our construction provides a concrete realization of twisted traces that arise as the correlation functions of a conformal field theory, particularly in the work of Beem, Peelaers, and Rastelli. This complements recent developments in the study of twisted traces on quantum Higgs branches and offers new mathematical insights into the structure of quantum Coulomb branches.</description>

      <title>Synthetic equivariant spectra for finite abelian groups and motivic homotopy theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a topological reconstruction result for the category of cellular $A$-equivariant motivic spectra over the complex numbers where $A$ is a finite abelian group: after completion at an arbitrary prime, this is equivalent to the completion of a category of synthetic $A$-equivariant spectra. The latter is a deformation of equivariant spectra which categorifies the equivariant perfect even filtration and is closely related to the equivariant Adams--Novikov spectral sequence. Our main computational input is a description of the bigraded homotopy groups of equivariant algebraic cobordism in terms of equivariant formal group laws.</description>

      <title>$K_1(Var)$ is presented by stratified birational equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete presentation of $K_1(Var)$, the $K_1$ group of varieties, resolving and simplifying a problem left open in \cite{ZakhK1}. Our approach adapts Gillet-Grayson's $G$-Construction to define an un-delooped $K$-theory spectrum of varieties. There are two levels on which one can read the present paper. On a technical level, we streamline and extend previous results on the $K$-theory of exact categories to a broader class of categories, including $Var$. On a more conceptual level, our investigations bring into focus an interesting generalisation of automorphisms (``double exact squares'') which generate $K_1$. For varieties, this isolates a subclass of birational equivalences which we call stratified, but the construction extends to a wide range of non-additive contexts (e.g. $o$-minimal structures, definable sets etc.). This raises a challenging question: what kind of information do these generalised automorphisms calibrate?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first give a geometric construction of a 2-dimensional mixed motive over $\mathbb{Q}$ with the Catalan constant $\mathbf{G}=1-1/3^2+1/5^2-1/7^2+\cdots$ as a period. We then use this motive to obtain a supply of linear forms in 1 and $\mathbf{G}$. We also explicitly compute the coefficients of 1 and $\mathbf{G}$ in these linear forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic algebraic geometry is a new approach to algebraic geometry. It consists in using homotopy type theory extended with three axioms, together with the interpretation of these in a higher version of the Zariski topos, in order to do algebraic geometry internally to this topos. In this article, we will show basic properties of projective n-space $\mathbb{P}^n$ in synthetic algebraic geometry. In particular, we show that the automorphism group of $\mathbb{P}^n$ is $\mathrm{PGL}_{n+1}(R)$ and that the picard group is $\mathbb{Z}$. We will provide different proofs of the latter statement, where the most synthetic approach naturally leads to the refined statement that the type of line bundles on $\mathbb{P}^n$ is the higher type $\mathbb{Z}\times K(R^\times,1)$, where $K(R^\times,1)$ is a delooping of the group of units of the internal base ring $R$.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\rm k}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and $G$ a connect, reductive group over it. Let $X$ be a projective $G$-variety of complexity 1. We classify $G$-equivariant normal test configurations of $X$ with integral central fibre via the combinatorial data. We also give a formula of anti-canonical divisors on $X$. Based on this formula, when $X$ is $\mathbb Q$-Fano, we give an expression of the Futaki invariant, and derive a criterion of uniform K-stability in terms of the combinatorial data.</description>

Abstract: Given a log Calabi--Yau surface $(Y,D)$, Bousseau has constructed a quantization of the mirror algebra of this pair. We give a formula for structure constants of this quantization in terms of higher genus descendant logarithmic Gromov--Witten invariants of $(Y,D)$. Our result generalises the weak Frobenius structure conjecture for surfaces to the $q$-refined setting, and is proved by relating these invariants to counts of quantum broken lines in the associated quantum scattering diagram.</description>

We examine intrinsic properties of such varieties and the connection between Clifford multiplication and their endomorphism algebras. We then extend the analysis of Clifford multiplication to the dual torus $Pic^{0}(S_{\Delta})$.</description>

Abstract: We classify finite subgroups of automorphism groups of non-trivial Severi--Brauer varieties of dimension $p-1$, where $p \ge 3$ is prime, over an arbitrary field whose characteristic is coprime to $p$. In addition, we construct a universal example in the case when the base field has characteristic 0; that is, we exhibit a field of characteristic 0 together with a non-trivial Severi--Brauer variety such that every finite subgroup allowed by our classification acts on it. For positive characteristic, we provide universal examples in a weaker sense.</description>

Abstract: We compute the completion of the local ring of the Hilbert scheme of degree $n+1$ subschemes of $\mathbb{A}^n$ at the point corresponding to the ideal $\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n\rangle^2$, and describe the completion of the universal family. For the purposes of comparison, we do this computation with both classical and DGLA methods. We use our explicit equations to produce high dimensional linear subspaces of the Hilbert scheme, and compare our equations with those coming from deformations of based algebras.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notions of higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities to pairs in the sense of the minimal model program. We extend numerous results to these higher pairs, including Bertini type theorems, stability under finite maps and that m-rational pairs are m-Du Bois. We prove these using a generalized Kov\'acs-Schwede-type injectivity theorem for pairs, the main technical result of this paper.</description>

Abstract: We show the Harris--Viehmann conjecture under some Hodge--Newton reducibility condition for a generalization of the diamond of a non-basic Rapoport--Zink space at infinite level, which appears as a cover of the non-semi-stable locus in the Hecke stack. We show also that the cohomology of the non-semi-stable locus with coefficient coming from a cuspidal Langlands parameter vanishes. As an application, we show the Hecke eigensheaf property in Fargues' conjecture for cuspidal Langlands parameters in the GL(2)-case.</description>

      <title>Isogeny relations in products of families of elliptic curves</title>

Abstract: Let $E_{\lambda}$ be the Legendre family of elliptic curves with equation $Y^2=X(X-1)(X-\lambda)$. Given a curve $\mathcal{C}$, satisfying a condition on the degrees of some of its coordinates and parametrizing $m$ points $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in E_{\lambda}$ and $n$ points $Q_1, \ldots, Q_n \in E_{\mu}$ and assuming that those points are generically linearly independent over the generic endomorphism ring, we prove that there are at most finitely many points $\mathbf{c}_0$ on $\mathcal{C}$, such that there exists an isogeny $\phi: E_{\mu(\mathbf{c}_0)} \rightarrow E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ and the $m+n$ points $P_1(\mathbf{c}_0), \ldots, P_m(\mathbf{c}_0), \phi(Q_1(\mathbf{c}_0)), \ldots, \phi(Q_n(\mathbf{c}_0)) \in E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ are linearly dependent over $\mathrm{End}(E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)})$.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Hidden Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been noticed since around 2007 that certain enumeration problems can be solved when an analytic or algebraic curve is identified. This curve is the key to the problem. In these lectures, a few such examples are presented. One is a detailed account on counting simple Hurwitz numbers, explaining how the problem was solved by discovering this key curve. The formula for the curve allows us to write the generating functions of Hurwitz numbers in terms of polynomials. This unexpected polynomiality produces, as a byproduct, straightforward and short proofs of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem and the $\lambda_g$-theorem of Faber-Pandharipande. An analogous enumeration problem associated with Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of analysis. The asymptotic behavior of counting leads this time to the Euler characteristic of the moduli spaces of smooth curves. We then discuss another enumeration problem, the Ap\'ery sequences. The quest of identifying the hidden curve for this case remains open.
  These curves, also known as spectral curves, are discovered via solving ordinary differential equations. The counting problem of geometric origin associated with the genus 0, one marked point case is encoded in the spectral curve. It is explained that going from the $(g,n)=(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$ is a process of quantization of the spectral curve.
  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when the differential equations are linear with holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs bundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context, however, there are no counting problems behind the scene.</description>

      <title>Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can algebraic geometry enhance the sharpness, robustness, and interpretability of modern neural reasoning models by equipping them with a mathematically grounded inductive bias? To answer this, we introduce Tropical Attention, an attention mechanism grounded in tropical geometry that lifts the attention kernel into tropical projective space, where reasoning is piecewise-linear and 1-Lipschitz, thus preserving the polyhedral decision structure inherent to combinatorial reasoning. We prove that Multi-Head Tropical Attention (MHTA) stacks universally approximate tropical circuits and realize tropical transitive closure through composition, achieving polynomial resource bounds without invoking recurrent mechanisms. These guarantees explain why the induced polyhedral decision boundaries remain sharp and scale-invariant, rather than smoothed by Softmax. Empirically, we show that Tropical Attention delivers stronger out-of-distribution generalization in both length and value, with high robustness against perturbative noise, and substantially faster inference with fewer parameters compared to Softmax-based and recurrent attention baselines. For the first time, we extend neural algorithmic reasoning beyond PTIME problems to NP-hard and NP-complete problems, paving the way toward sharper and more expressive Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) capable of tackling complex combinatorial challenges in phylogenetics, cryptography, particle physics, and mathematical discovery.</description>

      <title>Many rays of the submodular cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the cone of submodular functions goes back to Jack Edmonds' seminal 1970 paper, which already highlighted the difficulty of characterizing its extreme rays. Since then, researchers from diverse fields have sought to characterize, enumerate, and bound the number of such rays. In this paper, we introduce an inductive construction that generates new rays of the submodular cone. This allows us to establish that the $n$-th submodular cone has at least $2^{2^{n-2}}$ rays, which improves upon the lower bound obtained from Hien Q. Nguyen's 1986 characterization of indecomposable matroid polytopes by a factor of order $\sqrt{n^3}$ in the exponent.</description>
