      <title>PixelsDB: Serverless and Natural-Language-Aided Data Analytics with Flexible Service Levels and Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serverless query processing has become increasingly popular due to its advantages, including automated hardware and software management, high elasticity, and pay-as-you-go pricing. For users who are not system experts, serverless query processing greatly reduces the cost of owning a data analytic system. However, it is still a significant challenge for non-expert users to transform their complex and evolving data analytic needs into proper SQL queries and select a serverless query engine that delivers satisfactory performance and price for each type of query.
  This paper presents PixelsDB, an open-source data analytic system that allows users who lack system or SQL expertise to explore data efficiently. It allows users to generate and debug SQL queries using a natural language interface powered by fine-tuned language models. The queries are then executed by a serverless query engine that offers varying prices for different service levels on query urgency. The service levels are natively supported by dedicated architecture design and heterogeneous resource scheduling that can apply cost-efficient resources to process non-urgent queries. We envision that the combination of a serverless paradigm, a natural-language-aided interface, and flexible service levels and prices will substantially improve the user experience in data analysis.</description>

      <title>MUVERA: Multi-Vector Retrieval via Fixed Dimensional Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural embedding models have become a fundamental component of modern information retrieval (IR) pipelines. These models produce a single embedding $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ per data-point, allowing for fast retrieval via highly optimized maximum inner product search (MIPS) algorithms. Recently, beginning with the landmark ColBERT paper, multi-vector models, which produce a set of embedding per data point, have achieved markedly superior performance for IR tasks. Unfortunately, using these models for IR is computationally expensive due to the increased complexity of multi-vector retrieval and scoring.
  In this paper, we introduce MUVERA (MUlti-VEctor Retrieval Algorithm), a retrieval mechanism which reduces multi-vector similarity search to single-vector similarity search. This enables the usage of off-the-shelf MIPS solvers for multi-vector retrieval. MUVERA asymmetrically generates Fixed Dimensional Encodings (FDEs) of queries and documents, which are vectors whose inner product approximates multi-vector similarity. We prove that FDEs give high-quality $\epsilon$-approximations, thus providing the first single-vector proxy for multi-vector similarity with theoretical guarantees. Empirically, we find that FDEs achieve the same recall as prior state-of-the-art heuristics while retrieving 2-5$\times$ fewer candidates. Compared to prior state of the art implementations, MUVERA achieves consistently good end-to-end recall and latency across a diverse set of the BEIR retrieval datasets, achieving an average of 10$\%$ improved recall with $90\%$ lower latency.</description>

      <title>Threshold-Independent Fair Matching through Score Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity Matching (EM) is a critical task in numerous fields, such as healthcare, finance, and public administration, as it identifies records that refer to the same entity within or across different databases. EM faces considerable challenges, particularly with false positives and negatives. These are typically addressed by generating matching scores and apply thresholds to balance false positives and negatives in various contexts. However, adjusting these thresholds can affect the fairness of the outcomes, a critical factor that remains largely overlooked in current fair EM research. The existing body of research on fair EM tends to concentrate on static thresholds, neglecting their critical impact on fairness. To address this, we introduce a new approach in EM using recent metrics for evaluating biases in score based binary classification, particularly through the lens of distributional parity. This approach enables the application of various bias metrics like equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity without depending on threshold settings. Our experiments with leading matching methods reveal potential biases, and by applying a calibration technique for EM scores using Wasserstein barycenters, we not only mitigate these biases but also preserve accuracy across real world datasets. This paper contributes to the field of fairness in data cleaning, especially within EM, which is a central task in data cleaning, by promoting a method for generating matching scores that reduce biases across different thresholds.</description>

      <title>Applications of Information Inequalities to Database Theory Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper describes several applications of information inequalities to problems in database theory. The problems discussed include: upper bounds of a query's output, worst-case optimal join algorithms, the query domination problem, and the implication problem for approximate integrity constraints. The paper is self-contained: all required concepts and results from information inequalities are introduced here, gradually, and motivated by database problems.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency Handling in Prioritized Databases with Universal Constraints: Complexity Analysis and Links with Active Integrity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the problem of repairing and querying inconsistent databases equipped with universal constraints. We adopt symmetric difference repairs, in which both deletions and additions of facts can be used to restore consistency, and suppose that preferred repair actions are specified via a binary priority relation over (negated) facts. Our first contribution is to show how existing notions of optimal repairs, defined for simpler denial constraints and repairs solely based on fact deletion, can be suitably extended to our richer setting. We next study the computational properties of the resulting repair notions, in particular, the data complexity of repair checking and inconsistency-tolerant query answering. Finally, we clarify the relationship between optimal repairs of prioritized databases and repair notions introduced in the framework of active integrity constraints. In particular, we show that Pareto-optimal repairs in our setting correspond to founded, grounded and justified repairs w.r.t. the active integrity constraints obtained by translating the prioritized database. Our study also yields useful insights into the behavior of active integrity constraints.</description>

      <title>ReMatch: Retrieval Enhanced Schema Matching with LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schema matching is a crucial task in data integration, involving the alignment of a source schema with a target schema to establish correspondence between their elements. This task is challenging due to textual and semantic heterogeneity, as well as differences in schema sizes. Although machine-learning-based solutions have been explored in numerous studies, they often suffer from low accuracy, require manual mapping of the schemas for model training, or need access to source schema data which might be unavailable due to privacy concerns. In this paper we present a novel method, named ReMatch, for matching schemas using retrieval-enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method avoids the need for predefined mapping, any model training, or access to data in the source database. Our experimental results on large real-world schemas demonstrate that ReMatch is an effective matcher. By eliminating the requirement for training data, ReMatch becomes a viable solution for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>DuckDB-SGX2: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly within Confidential Analytical Query Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an evaluation of an analytical workload in a confidential computing environment, combining DuckDB with two technologies: modular columnar encryption in Parquet files (data at rest) and the newest version of the Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing a hardware enclave where data in flight can be (more) securely decrypted and processed. One finding is that the "performance tax" for such confidential analytical processing is acceptable compared to not using these technologies. We eventually manage to run TPC-H SF30 with under 2x overhead compared to non-encrypted, non-enclave execution; we show that, specifically, columnar compression and encryption are a good combination. Our second finding consists of dos and don'ts to tune DuckDB to work effectively in this environment. There are various performance hazards: potentially 5x higher cache miss costs due to memory encryption inside the enclave, NUMA penalties, and highly elevated cost of swapping pages in and out of the enclave -- which is also triggered indirectly by using a non-SGX-aware malloc library.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data is a critical resource for Machine Learning (ML), yet working with data remains a key friction point. This paper introduces Croissant, a metadata format for datasets that simplifies how data is used by ML tools and frameworks. Croissant makes datasets more discoverable, portable and interoperable, thereby addressing significant challenges in ML data management and responsible AI. Croissant is already supported by several popular dataset repositories, spanning hundreds of thousands of datasets, ready to be loaded into the most popular ML frameworks.</description>
