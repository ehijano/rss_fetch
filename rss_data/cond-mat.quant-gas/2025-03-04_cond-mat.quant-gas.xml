      <title>Understanding Floquet Resonances in Ultracold Gas Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering by a short-range potential with time-periodic interaction strength is investigated with a Floquet-scattering theory. Sharp resonances occur, at which the s-wave scattering length can be tuned to large positive and negative values. We show that the shape of these resonances is described by a simple formula, and find that both resonance position and prefactor can be altered by the driving strength. Our approach allows to identify the physical origin of the scattering resonances as Floquet bound states with positive energies, which are dynamically created by the drive. This insight is valuable for a detailed analysis and uncovers a general resource for enhanced or reduced scattering in Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Exploration of Phase Transitions in a Cavity-BEC System with Two Crossed Optical Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) inside an optical cavity and two crossed coherent pump fields. We determine the phase boundary separating the normal superfluid phase and the superradiance phase, perturbatively. In the regime of negative cavity detuning, we map out the phase diagrams both for an attractive and a repulsive optical lattice. It turns out that the situation is quite different in two cases. Specifically, in the case of attractive lattice, if a system is in the superradiant phase with one pump laser, adding another pump does not drive the system out of the superradiance phase. While for the repulsive lattice, increasing another pump potential have suppressive effects on the superradiance. We also find that, in the case of attractive lattice, equally increasing two pump lattice potentials can induce a transition from the normal phase to the superradiance phase. In stark contrast, for the repulsive lattice, the system will remain in the normal phase as the pump depths are tuned within a wide range, independent of the cavity detuning and the decay rate.</description>

      <title>Mediated Interactions and Damping Effects in Superfluid Mixtures of Bose and Fermi Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the homogeneous superfluid mixtures of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer~(BCS) superfluid originating from pairing two-species fermionic atoms and superfluidity stemming from condensation of bosonic atoms. By integrating out the freedoms associated with the BCS superfluid, we derive the fermion-mediated interactions between bosons, which is attractive and can be tuned from long range in the BCS region to short range in the region of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of molecular dimers. By analyzing the Bogoliubov spectrum and the damping rate of bosonic superfluid, we map out the phase diagram spanned by the boson-fermion mass ratio and the boson-fermion coupling strength, which consists of a phase separation region and two phase mixing regions with and without Landau damping. The three different phases can coexist at a tricritical point, which moves toward low boson-fermion mass ratio and high boson-fermion scattering length as the fermion-fermion interaction strength is tuned up on the BCS side.</description>

      <title>Correlated hopping induced topological order in an atomic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large majority of topological phases in one dimensional many-body systems are known to inherit from the corresponding single-particle Hamiltonian. In this work, we go beyond this assumption and find a new example of topological order induced through specific interactions couplings. Specifically, we consider a fermionic mixture where one component experiences a staggered onsite potential and it is coupled through density dependent hopping interactions to the other fermionic component. Crucially, by varying the sign of the staggered potential, we show that this latter fermionic component can acquire topological properties. Thanks to matrix product state simulations, we prove this result both at the equilibrium by extracting the behavior of correlation functions and in an out-of-equilibrium scheme by employing a Thouless charge pumping. Notably, we further discuss how our results can be probed in quantum simulators made up of ultracold atoms. Our results reveal an important and alternative mechanism that can give rise to topological order.</description>

      <title>Temperature Measurement via Time Crystal Frequencies in One-Dimensional Quantum Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for temperature measurement by analyzing the frequency of generated time crystals in one-dimensional (1D) quantum droplets. The system consists of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate mixture confined in a driven quasi-periodic optical lattice (QOL) with repulsive cubic effective mean-field and attractive quadratic beyond-mean-field interactions. By solving the 1D extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we derive the exact analytical wavefunction and investigate the droplet dynamics under different driving conditions. Specifically, we examine three cases: (i) constant driving frequency with linearly increasing QOL depth, (ii) constant QOL depth with linearly varying driving frequency, and (iii) constant driving frequency with sinusoidally modulated QOL depth. Fast Fourier Transform analysis reveals harmonic density oscillations, confirming time crystal formation. Additionally, we establish a non-trivial correlation between time crystal frequency and system temperature, demonstrating that an increase in time crystal frequency leads to oscillatory variations in the magnitude of the droplet's negative temperature. Finally, numerical stability analysis confirms that the obtained solutions remain robust, ensuring their feasibility for experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Probing $p$-wave effects in spin-density separation of Bose mixtures by dynamic structure factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of Bose gases with tunable $s$- and $p$-wave interactions offer a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated phases and exotic phenomena. While repulsive interactions often drive phase separation, the interplay of $p$-wave interactions with spin-density decoupling remains underexplored. In this work, we employ the path integal field theory to investigate the role of $p$-wave interactions in three-dimensional two-component Bose gas. We derive the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion, revealing how $p$-wave interactions modify equations of state of the model system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $p$-wave interactions predominantly renormalize the spin-sector effective mass in the language of decoupling the density and spin-density degrees of freedom. This effect manifests in the dynamic structure factor, computed via hydrodynamic theory, where Bragg spectroscopy can detect a tunable splitting between spin and density modes. Our results bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, offering insights into anisotropic interaction effects in quantum gases and their implications for probing emergent phases.</description>

      <title>Efficient shortcuts-to-adiabaticity for loading an ultracold Fermi gas into higher orbital bands of one-dimensional optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to load ultracold Fermi gases from the ground orbital band of a one-dimensional optical lattice into the first excited orbital band. Unlike the narrow momentum distribution of a Bose-Einstein Condensate, Fermi gases exhibit a broad momentum distribution. To address this, we define the average loading efficiency across all quasi-momentum states and theoretically perform the loading operation simultaneously for each Bloch state. Using a multiparameter global optimization method, we determine the loading efficiency at various lattice depths. We can enhance the loading efficiency by adjusting the phase of the lattice, which leverages the different symmetries of Bloch wavefunctions in various optical lattice orbitals. We also identified that the primary factor hindering higher loading efficiency in the Fermi gas is the multiple occupancy of the quasi-momentum states. Our simulations of various occupancies revealed a decreasing trend in mean loading efficiency as the number of occupied quasi-momentum states increases. Finally, we compare our method with other loading techniques and assess its experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Leap into the future: shortcut to dynamics for quantum mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just like the fast-forward button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.</description>

      <title>Tail-induced equilibration in long-range interacting quantum lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relation between inter-particle interactions and real-time equilibration in one-dimensional lattice systems with hard-core constraints. Focusing on the roles of interactions, our results demonstrate that in the presence of interaction tails, any power-law exponent (including the limit ones) can encode the random particle configurations to the Hamiltonian, leaving the latter characterized by random matrices. Through an experimental-accessible setup using dipolar-interacting particles in optical lattices, the quenched relaxations are demonstrated resulting in equilibrium, and the relation between eigenstate thermalization is confirmed. Our study directly unveiled the role of inter-particle interactions in quantum many-body dynamics, offering a new scheme to address equilibration in closed quantum many-body problem based on the manifesting of random particle configurations in the model Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced unatomic trimer states in mass-imbalanced systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As resonantly interacting trimers of the type AAB are progressively squeezed from $D=3$ to $D=2$, unatomic states emerge. We calculated the contacts from the high momentum tail of the single particle densities. The sharp increase of the contacts serves as a signature of the transition between the Efimov and unatomic regimes, characterized by the emergence of continuous scale invariance when the system reaches a critical dimension, $D_c$. This continuous scale invariance starts to dominate the behavior of the system at the dimension $\overline{D}&lt;D_c$, below which the trimers momentum distribution tails exhibit a power-law behavior signaling the unatomic regime. To illustrate our findings, we studied compounds of the forms $^{7}$Li$-^{23}$Na$_{2}$, $^{7}$Li$-^{87}$Rb$_{2}$ and $^{7}$Li$-^{133}$Cs$_{2}$. The increase in the mass-imbalance of the trimers reduces the interval between $D_c$ and $\overline{D}$. The emergence of unatomic states can be experimentally verified by observing the two-body contact parameter, which is a quantity directly related to the thermodynamic properties of the gas.</description>

      <title>Kelvin waves in nonequilibrium universal dynamics of relativistic scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</description>

      <title>The Coherent Forward Scattering peak: a probe of non-ergodicity and symmetries in a quantum chaotic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coherent Backscattering (CBS) peak is a well-known interferential signature of weak localization in disordered or chaotic systems. Recently, it was realized that another interferential peak, the Coherent Forward Scattering (CFS) peak, emerges in the presence of strong localization. This peak has never been observed directly to date. We report the first direct observation of the CFS peak and demonstrate its dual role as signature of non-ergodicity and as probe of symmetries in quantum chaotic systems. Using a shaken rotor model realized with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms in a modulated optical lattice, we investigate dynamical localization in momentum space. The CFS peak emerges in the position distribution as a consequence of non-ergodic dynamics, while its growth timescale depends critically on the localization scale. By finely tuning the modulation, we control the symmetries of the dynamics (time-reversal and parity) and measure their impact on both CFS and CBS peaks. Our results highlight the strong link of CFS and its temporal growth with symmetry and localization properties, establishing CFS as a robust quantitative marker of non-ergodicity. This work opens new avenues for characterizing non-ergodicity and symmetries in quantum chaotic or disordered systems, with possible applications in many-body localization and many-body chaos.</description>

      <title>A projected complex Langevin sampling method for bosons in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a projected complex Langevin (CL) numerical sampling method -- a fictitious Langevin dynamics scheme that uses numerical projection to sample a constrained stationary distribution with highly oscillatory character. Despite the complex-valued degrees of freedom and associated sign-problem, the projected CL method succeeds as a natural extension of real-valued projected Langevin processes. In the new proposed method, complex-valued Lagrange multipliers are determined to enforce constraints to machine precision at each iteration. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we adapt the projected CL method to sample coherent state quantum field theories describing interacting Bose gases, which are realized in modern cold-atom experiments. We apply projected CL to two scenarios with holomorphic constraints, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, and show that projected CL reproduces the correct thermodynamic observables. We further observe improved numerical stability and accuracy at larger timesteps when compared to the previous state-of-the-art method for performing constrained CL sampling.</description>

      <title>Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions-periodic for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations, which induce large impurity-impurity correlations that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information, respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</description>

      <title>Topological Chiral Edge States in a Synthetic Dimension of Atomic Trap States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key hallmark of quantum Hall physics is the existence of topological chiral states at the system boundary. Signatures of these edge states have been experimentally observed in cold atoms by using different approaches, including notably that of ``synthetic dimension'' in which internal states are coupled together and reinterpreted as sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, previous atomic synthetic dimension implementations have been limited to relatively small system sizes with inflexible boundaries. In this paper, we propose instead how to use a synthetic dimension of atomic trap states to observe chiral edge states in a large quantum Hall system with a tunable edge. We present numerical simulations for relevant experimental parameters, showing how this scheme may be used to probe the properties and robustness of the edge states to defects. Our work opens the way for future experiments in topological physics with synthetic dimensions, while also providing new ways to manipulate and control highly-excited trap states.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom of Two Heavy Impurities in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two heavy impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, and calculate the self-energy using the Wilsonian renormalization. The polaron energy, quasiparticle residue and damping rate are extracted from the self-energy. We demonstrate that various effective potentials emerge from the polaron energy under the specific conditions. In the limit of large separation between the impurities, the polaron spectrum converges to the results for a single impurity, exhibiting an attractive-repulsive crossover across the Feshbach resonance. The boundary of this crossover is identified through the analysis of the damping rate. We highlight that repulsive-dominant polarons can exist as long as the impurities are sufficiently close, even when the impurity-boson interactions are attractive. Additionally, we observe that the two impurities become asymptotically free in the repulsive polaron regime. These results are verifiable and offer a fresh perspective on the interaction dynamics between two polarons.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-Stark Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), namely the boundary localization of continuous-spectrum eigenstates. However, studies on the NHSE in systems without translational invariance are still limited. Here, we unveil a new class of NHSE, dubbed the imaginary-Stark skin effect (ISSE), in a one-dimensional lossy lattice with a spatially increasing loss rate. This ISSE is beyond the framework of non-Bloch band theory and exhibits intriguing properties significantly different from the conventional NHSE. Specifically, the energy spectrum of our model has a T-shaped feature, with approximately half of the eigenstates localized at the left boundary. Furthermore, each skin mode can be expressed as a single stable, exponentially-decaying wave within the bulk region. Such peculiar behaviors are analyzed via the transfer-matrix method, whose eigendecomposition quantifies the formation of the ISSE. Our work provides new insights into the NHSE in systems without translational symmetry and contributes to the understanding of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Many-Body Quantum Correlations in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Exactly characterizing critical states: invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical state of disordered systems is an intriguing and popular topic in condensed matter physics, known for its non-ergodic properties such as multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge so far. In this work, we propose an Ansatz for the critical state, and argue that critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both dual spaces. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we demonstrate that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, also exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces. Subsequent numerical simulations verify the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Two-body interaction induced phase transitions and intermediate phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that interactions could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into an intermediate mobility edge phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Ising phase transitions and thermodynamics of correlated fermions in a two-dimensional spin-dependent lattice potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge-density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>
