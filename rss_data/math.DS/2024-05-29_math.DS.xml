      <title>Torus diffeomorphisms with parabolic and non-proper actions on the fine curve graph and their generalized rotation sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a generic element of the Anosov-Katok class of the torus, $\overline{\mathcal{O}}^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}^2)$, acts parabolically and non-properly on the fine curve graph $C^{\dagger}(\mathbb{T}^2)$. Additionally, we show that a generic element of $\overline{\mathcal{O}}^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}^2)$ admits generalized rotation sets of any point-symmetric compact convex homothety type in the plane.</description>

      <title>A remark on rapid mixing for hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, we introduce a new criterion based on the temporal distance function that guarantees rapid mixing for a hyperbolic flow with respect to Gibbs measures. This criterion is probabilistically satisfied almost surely but lacks robustness. Moreover, it enables us to establish rapid mixing for a class of hyperbolic flows that do not meet the existing rapid mixing criteria. Furthermore, beyond uniform hyperbolicity, our proof also works for a significant category of non-uniformly hyperbolic flows that can be modeled by Young towers.</description>

      <title>A new platooning model for connected and autonomous vehicles to improve string stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel idea of coordinated vehicle platooning such that platoon followers inside the platoon communicates only to the platoon leader. A novel dynamic model is proposed to take driving safety into account when there is communication delay. Some general results of linear stability are proved mathematically, and numerical simulations are conducted to show the effect of model parameters for both ring road with an initial disturbance and infinite road with a periodic disturbance. The simulation results are consistent with theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed look-to-the-leader platooning strategy is far superior than the follow-one-vehicle-ahead or follow-two-vehicle-ahead conventional car-following (CF) strategies in stabilizing traffic flow. This paper provides a new perspective for the organization of platoons of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Set Descriptive Complexity of Solvable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced and studied a precise class of dynamical systems called solvable systems. These systems present a dynamic ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with solvable right-hand terms and unique evolution. They correspond to a class of systems for which a transfinite method exist to compute the solution. We also presented several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems might describe ordinal Turing computations. In the current article, we study in more depth solvable systems, using tools from descriptive set theory. By establishing a correspondence with the class of well-founded trees, we construct a coanalytic ranking over the set of solvable functions and discuss its relation with other existing rankings for differentiable functions, in particular with the Kechris-Woodin, Denjoy and Zalcwasser ranking. We prove that our ranking is unbounded below the first uncountable ordinal.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the absolute period foliation of a stratum of holomorphic 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a connected component of a stratum of the moduli space of holomorphic $1$-forms of genus $g$. We show that the absolute period foliation of $\mathcal{C}$ is ergodic on the area-$1$ locus, and that the non-dense leaves lie in an explicit countable union of suborbifolds, subject to a mild assumption on $\mathcal{C}$. We show similar results for subspaces of $\mathcal{C}$ defined by topological restrictions on the absolute periods. We obtain these dynamical results by showing that for a typical positive cohomology class in $H^1(S_g;\mathbb{C})$, the associated space of isoperiodic forms in $\mathcal{C}$ is connected. Lastly, we show that certain covering constructions provide examples of spaces of isoperiodic forms with positive dimension and infinitely many connected components.</description>

      <title>On the local Fourier uniformity problem for small sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider vanishing properties of exponential sums of the Liouville function $\lambda$ of the form $$ \lim_{H\to\infty}\limsup_{X\to\infty}\frac{1}{\log X}\sum_{m\leq X}\frac{1}{m}\sup_{\alpha\in C}\bigg|\frac{1}{H}\sum_{h\leq H}\lambda(m+h)e^{2\pi ih\alpha}\bigg|=0, $$ where $C\subset\mathbb{T}$. The case $C=\mathbb{T}$ corresponds to the local $1$-Fourier uniformity conjecture of Tao, a central open problem in the study of multiplicative functions with far-reaching number-theoretic applications. We show that the above holds for any closed set $C\subset\mathbb{T}$ of zero Lebesgue measure. Moreover, we prove that extending this to any set $C$ with non-empty interior is equivalent to the $C=\mathbb{T}$ case, which shows that our results are essentially optimal without resolving the full conjecture. We also consider higher-order variants. We prove that if the linear phase $e^{2\pi ih\alpha}$ is replaced by a polynomial phase $e^{2\pi ih^t\alpha}$ for $t\geq 2$ then the statement remains true for any set $C$ of upper box-counting dimension $&lt;1/t$. The statement also remains true if the supremum over linear phases is replaced with a supremum over all nilsequences coming form a compact countable ergodic subsets of any $t$-step nilpotent Lie group. Furthermore, we discuss the unweighted version of the local $1$-Fourier uniformity problem, showing its validity for a class of ``rigid'' sets (of full Hausdorff dimension) and proving a density result for all closed subsets of zero Lebesgue measure.</description>

Abstract: These notes are a slightly enlarged version of my habilitation thesis, where our research interest and main results in the past few years are summarized. Most of the discussion revolves around complex ordinary differential equations and their underling foliations, singularity theory and dynamical systems. Compared to the original text, a section containing some background material on holomorphic foliations was added. Also some new results obtained in the past three years that are in line with the one presented in the habilitation were included.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of Equilibria and a Poincar\'e-Bendixson-type Theorem for Holomorphic Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the local geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x}=F(x)$ with real time parameterization, where $F$ is holomorphic on connected open subsets of $\mathbb{C}\stackrel{\sim}{=}\mathbb{R}^2$. We describe the geometry of first-order equilibria. For equilibria of higher orders, we establish an equivalent condition for "definite directions", allowing us to reverse the implication in Theorem 2 of Chapter 2.10 in [Differential equations and dynamical systems, Lawrence Perko (1990)] under the additional condition of holomorphy. This enables the geometric construction of a finite elliptic decomposition. We derive a holomorphic Poincar\'e-Bendixson-type theorem, leading to the conclusion that bounded non-periodic orbits are always homoclinic or heteroclinic.</description>

      <title>Billiards in polyhedra: a method to convert 2-dimensional uniformity to 3-dimensional uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of 2-dimensional non-integrable flat dynamical systems has a rather extensive literature with many deep results, but the methods developed for this type of problems, both the traditional approach via Teichm\"{u}ller geometry and our recent shortline-ancestor method, appear to be exclusively plane-specific. Thus we know very little of any real significance concerning 3-dimensional systems.
  Our purpose here is to describe some very limited extensions of uniformity in 2 dimensions to uniformity in 3 dimensions. We consider a 3-manifold which is the cartesian product of the regular octagonal surface with the unit torus. This is a restricted system, in the sense that one of the directions is integrable. However, this restriction also allows us to make use of a transference theorem for arithmetic progressions established earlier by Beck, Donders and Yang.</description>

      <title>Finding bifurcations in mathematical epidemiology via reaction network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical Epidemiology (ME) shares with Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) the basic mathematical structure of its dynamical systems. Despite this central similarity, methods from CRNT have been seldom applied to solving problems in ME. We explore here the applicability of CRNT methods to find bifurcations at endemic equilibria of ME models. We adapt three CRNT methods to the features of ME. First, we prove that essentially all ME models admit Hopf bifurcations for certain monotone choices of the interaction functions. Second, we offer a parametrization of equilibria Jacobians of ME systems where few interactions are not in mass action form. Third, for a quite general class of models, we show that periodic oscillations in closed systems imply periodic oscillations when demography is added. Finally, we apply such results to two families of networks: a general SIR model with a nonlinear force of infection and treatment rate and a recent SIRnS model with a gradual increase in infectiousness. We give both necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of bifurcations at endemic equilibria of both families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that local stable/unstable sets of homeomorphisms of an infinite compact metric space satisfying the gluing-orbit property always contain compact and perfect subsets of the space. As a consequence, we prove that if a positively countably expansive homeomorphism satisfies the gluing-orbit property, then the space is a single periodic orbit. We also prove that there are homeomorphisms with gluing-orbit such that its induced homeomorphism on the hyperspace of compact subsets does not have gluing-orbit, contrasting with the case of the shadowing and specification properties, proving that if the induced map has gluing-orbit, then the base map has gluing-orbit and is topologically mixing.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{Fourier spectrum} which is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier dimension and the Hausdorff dimension for both sets and measures. We establish some fundamental theory and motivate the concept via several applications, especially to sumset type problems. For example, we study dimensions of convolutions and sumsets, and solve the distance set problem for sets satisfying certain Fourier analytic conditions.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $\lbrace \varphi_i\rbrace_{i\in \Gamma}$ and $\lbrace \psi_j\rbrace_{j\in\Lambda}$ are self-affine iterated function systems on the plane that satisfy strong separation, domination and irreducibility, then for any associated self-affine measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, the inequality $$\dim_{\rm H}(\mu*\nu) &lt; \min \lbrace 2, \dim_{\rm H} \mu + \dim_{\rm H} \nu \rbrace$$ implies that there is algebraic resonance between the eigenvalues of the linear parts of $\varphi_i$ and $\psi_j$. This extends to planar non-conformal setting the existing analogous results for self-conformal measures on the line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish Diophantine type estimates on shifts of trigonometric polynomials on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, as well as that of their square roots. These estimates arise from the spectral analysis of the quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger and the quasi-periodic wave operators. They have applications to the nonlinear quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) and the nonlinear quasi-periodic wave equations (NLW). One could now, for example, extend the result of Bourgain (Geom. Funct. Anal. 17(3): 682-706, 2007) to the nonlinear setting.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Simulation experiments on six problems under five agents, including the benchmarked one, provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</description>
