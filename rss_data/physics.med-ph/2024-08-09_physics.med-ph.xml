      <title>Exploring the Impact of Cochlear Implant Stimulation Artefacts in EEG Recordings: Unveiling Potential Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given rising numbers of bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users, predominantly children, there is a clinical need for efficient and reliable tests that can objectively evaluate binaural hearing. These tests are crucial for guiding the setup of bilateral CIs to optimise delivery of binaural cues. Our primary goal is to introduce a clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure to assess binaural hearing function at various stages within the auditory pathway. Previous research demonstrated that bilateral CI users significantly decrease in ability to discriminate interaural time differences when pulse rates exceed 300 pulses per second. Our paradigm utilizes different pulse rates to objectively explore the limits. A notable challenge with this EEG procedure is the interference induced by CI electrical stimulus artefacts. Despite this obstacle, the potential benefits of CI stimulation artefacts often go unnoticed. This paper outlines positive applications of the frequently criticized CI artefacts for optimizing the experiment setup.</description>

      <title>Design, Construction, and Test of Compact, Distributed-Charge, X-Band Accelerator Systems that Enable Image-Guided, VHEE FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of laser-Compton x-ray systems based on compact distributed charge accelerator structures can enable micron-scale imaging of disease and the concomitant production of beams of Very High Energy Electrons (VHEEs) capable of producing FLASH-relevant dose rates. The physics of laser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly the trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to image-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture capable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band RF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100 MeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a distributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF pulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by the illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses synchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV pulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes the RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band continuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10 {\mu}A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a compact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton scattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of "clinical" footprint. At the same time, the production of 1000 or greater individual micro-bunches per RF pulse enables &gt; 10 nC of charge to be produced in a macrobunch of &lt; 100 ns. The design, construction, and test of the 100-MeV class prototype system in Irvine, CA is also presented.</description>

      <title>TOF MLEM Adaptation for the Total-Body J-PET with a Realistic Analytical System Response Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a study of the original image reconstruction algorithm based on the time-of-flight maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (TOF MLEM), developed for the total-body (TB) Jagiellonian PET (J-PET) scanners. The method is applicable to generic cylindrical or modular multi-layer layouts and is extendable to multi-photon imaging. The system response matrix (SRM) is represented as a set of analytical functions, uniquely defined for each pair of plastic scintillator strips used for the detection. A realistic resolution model (RM) in detector space is derived from fitting the Monte Carlo simulated emissions and detections of annihilation photons on oblique transverse planes. Additional kernels embedded in SRM account for TOF, parallax effect and axial smearing. The algorithm was tested on datasets, simulated in GATE for the NEMA IEC and static XCAT phantoms inside a 24-module 2-layer TB J-PET. Compared to the reference TOF MLEM with none or a shift-invariant RM, an improvement was observed, as evaluated by the analysis of image quality, difference images and ground truth metrics. We also reconstructed the data with additive contributions, pre-filtered geometrically and with non-TOF scatter correction applied. Despite some deterioration, the obtained results still capitalise on the realistic RM with better edge preservation and superior ground truth metrics. The envisioned prospects of the TOF MLEM with analytical SRM include its application in multi-photon imaging and further upgrade to account for the non-collinearity, positron range and other factors.</description>

      <title>Improving Automated Hemorrhage Detection in Sparse-view Computed Tomography via Deep Convolutional Neural Network based Artifact Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09340v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a preprint. The latest version has been published here: https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.230275
  Purpose: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is an effective way to reduce dose by lowering the total number of views acquired, albeit at the expense of image quality, which, in turn, can impact the ability to detect diseases. We explore deep learning-based artifact reduction in sparse-view cranial CT scans and its impact on automated hemorrhage detection. Methods: We trained a U-Net for artefact reduction on simulated sparse-view cranial CT scans from 3000 patients obtained from a public dataset and reconstructed with varying levels of sub-sampling. Additionally, we trained a convolutional neural network on fully sampled CT data from 17,545 patients for automated hemorrhage detection. We evaluated the classification performance using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC-ROCs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the DeLong test, along with confusion matrices. The performance of the U-Net was compared to an analytical approach based on total variation (TV). Results: The U-Net performed superior compared to unprocessed and TV-processed images with respect to image quality and automated hemorrhage diagnosis. With U-Net post-processing, the number of views can be reduced from 4096 (AUC-ROC: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.972-0.976) views to 512 views (0.973; 0.971-0.975) with minimal decrease in hemorrhage detection (P&lt;.001) and to 256 views (0.967; 0.964-0.969) with a slight performance decrease (P&lt;.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that U-Net based artifact reduction substantially enhances automated hemorrhage detection in sparse-view cranial CTs. Our findings highlight that appropriate post-processing is crucial for optimal image quality and diagnostic accuracy while minimizing radiation dose.</description>
