      <title>H$_2$O and CO$_2$ sorption in ion exchange sorbents: distinct interactions in amine versus quaternary ammonium materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the H$_2$O  and CO$_2$ sorption behavior of two ion exchange sorbents: a primary amine and a permanently charged strong base quaternary ammonium (QA) groups with (bi)carbonate counter-anions. We compare their distinct interactions with H$_2$O  and CO$_2$ through simultaneous thermal gravimetric, calorimetric, gas analysis and molecular modeling to evaluate their performance for dilute CO$_2$ separations like direct air capture. Thermal and hybrid (heat + low-temperature hydration) desorption experiments demonstrate that the QA-based sorbent binds both water and CO$_2$ more strongly than the amine counterparts but undergoes degradation at moderate temperatures, limiting its compatibility with thermal swing regeneration. However, a low-temperature moisture-driven regeneration pathway at is uniquely effective for the QA-based sorbent. To inform the energetics of a moisture-based CO$_2$ separation, we compare calorimetric water sorption enthalpies to isosteric enthalpies. To our knowledge, this includes the first direct measurement of water sorption enthalpy in the QA-based sorbent. Molecular modeling supports this observation, showing higher water sorption energies and denser charge distributions in the QA-based sorbent. Mixed gas experiments in QA-based sorbent show that not only does water influence CO$_2$ binding, but CO$_2$ influences water uptake through counterion-dependent hydration states, and that moisture swing responsiveness in this material causes hydration-induced CO$_2$ release and drying-induced CO$_2$ uptake, an important feature for low-energy CO$_2$ separation under ambient conditions. Overall, the two classes of sorbents offer distinct pathways for CO$_2$ separation. Primary amine-based sorbent relies on weaker hydrogen bonding and CO$_2$-amine interactions, while QA-based sorbent leverages stronger electrostatic coupling between water and QA-reactive anion pairs.</description>

      <title>Constructing Generalized Sample Transition Probabilities with Biased Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, accessing transition probabilities between states is crucial for understanding kinetic information, such as reaction paths and rates. However, standard MD simulations are hindered by the capacity to visit the states of interest, prompting the use of enhanced sampling to accelerate the process. Unfortunately, biased simulations alter the inherent probability distributions, making kinetic computations using techniques such as diffusion maps challenging. Here, we use a coarse-grained Markov chain to estimate the intrinsic pairwise transition probabilities between states sampled from a biased distribution. Our method, which we call the generalized sample transition probability (GSTP), can recover transition probabilities without relying on an underlying stochastic process and specifying the form of the kernel function, which is necessary for the diffusion map method. The proposed algorithm is validated on model systems such as a harmonic oscillator, alanine dipeptide in vacuum, and met-enkephalin in solvent. The results demonstrate that GSTP effectively recovers the unbiased eigenvalues and eigenstates from biased data. GSTP provides a general framework for analyzing kinetic information in complex systems, where biased simulations are necessary to access longer timescales.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking electronic-structure methods for the description of dark transitions in carbonyls at and beyond the Franck-Condon point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein, we propose a comprehensive benchmark of electronic-structure methods to describe dark transitions, that is, transitions to excited electronic states characterized by a near-zero oscillator strength. This type of electronic state is particularly important for the photochemistry of molecules containing carbonyl groups, such as atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The oscillator strength characterizing a dark transition can change dramatically by a slight alteration of the molecular geometry around its ground-state equilibrium, the so-called non-Condon effects. Hence, testing the performance of electronic-structure methods for dark transitions requires considering molecules at their Franck-Condon point (i.e., equilibrium geometry), but also beyond the Franck-Condon point. Our benchmark focuses on various electronic-structure methods - LR-TDDFT(/TDA), ADC(2), CC2, EOM-CCSD, CC2/3, XMS-CASPT2 - with CC3/aug-cc-pVTZ serving as a theoretical best estimate. These techniques are tested against a set of 16 carbonyl-containing VOCs at their equilibrium geometry. We then assess the performance of these methods to describe the dark transition of acetaldehyde beyond its Franck-Condon point by (i) distorting the molecule towards its S$_1$ minimum energy structure and (ii) sampling an approximate ground-state quantum distribution for the molecule and calculating photoabsorption cross-sections within the nuclear ensemble approach. Based on the calculated cross-sections, we calculate the photolysis half-life as depicted by the different electronic-structure methods - highlighting the impact of the different electronic-structure methods on predicted experimental photolysis observables.</description>

      <title>MARTINI-based force fields for predicting gas separation performances of MOF/polymer composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MOF/polymer composites have been widely investigated in the past decade for gas separation applications. However, the impact of MOF nanoparticle morphology and size in gas separation have not yet been systematically studied by computer simulation techniques. In this work, coarse grained simulations are deployed to study gas adsorption in ZIF-8/PVDF at the nanoparticle level. Nanoparticles of different morphologies and sizes are explored, and adsorption of CO2, N2 and CH4 is investigated throughout the extension of the bulk and surface of the nanoparticle as well as of the polymer phase. Results reproduce the expected preference for CO2 over the other two gasses. Nanoparticles of smaller sizes provide better separation performance at ambient conditions, while rhombic dodecahedron nanoparticles perform better than cubic ones. This work presents a perspective on the merits and limitations of modelling gas adsorption in MOF/polymer composites at the nanoparticle level via particle-based coarse graining approaches, and provides a methodological set-up which can be integrated into high-throughput schemes, bringing us closer to reaching time- and length scales that can be directly compared with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Calculating Vibronic Spectra with a linear algorithm based on Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately simulating molecular vibronic spectra remains computationally challenging due to the exponential scaling of required calculations. Here, we show that employing the linear coupling model within the gaussian boson sampling framework effectively addresses this limitation. We implement the algorithm for simulating the pentacene molecule through three distinct approaches, using numerical simulation on a classical computer and experimentally using two optical setups equipped with different photon detectors (SNSPD and SPAD). High fidelity $(F&gt;0.999)$ was achieved between the simulated Franck-Condon profiles and analytically calculated profiles obtained by enumerating all possible transitions within the linear coupling model. Furthermore, simulations were performed for larger molecular systems using 48 vibrational modes of naphthalene and 64 vibrational modes of anthracene. Comparison with experimental data confirms that the simulated spectra accurately reproduce both the positions and shapes of the measured spectral bands. A notable advantage of our algorithm is its scalability, requiring only a fixed minimal set of optical components irrespective of the size of the studied system.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum--Classical Machine Learning Potential with Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative, suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.</description>

      <title>Suspensions of small ultra-soft colloids remain liquids in overcrowded conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentrated suspensions of small ultra-soft colloids (ultra-low crosslinked microgels) are investigated with scattering and steady shear rheology to capture their equilibrium dynamics. The suspensions lack dynamic arrest, although the slow relaxation time $\tau_2$ follows exponential growth with increasing generalized packing fraction, $\zeta$. The zero-shear viscosity grows weakly with $\zeta$, and never diverges in contrast to other soft glass formers, e.g.~star-polymers, microgels, green particles. Their high compressibility allows these ultra-soft spheres to diffuse even in overcrowded environments.</description>

      <title>A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.</description>

      <title>Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description>

      <title>How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheatham NaCl model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient large-scale computer simulations of aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the complexity of these systems evidences the difficulties in describing solution properties without due account of polarization. Different strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of solvated ions. In this work, we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized to predict the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally well, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, but also surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe densities of NaCl solutions for models parametrized to their crystal and melt properties only. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and show that a robust parametrization can be achieved without invoking the concept of charge scaling.</description>
