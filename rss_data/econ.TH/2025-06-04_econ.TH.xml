      <title>Elasticity of substitution and general model of economic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to generalize some recent results obtained by Chilarescu and Manuel Gomez. Essentially, we are trying to study the effect of elasticity of substitution on the parameters of economic growth, based on its two possible values - lower and higher than one. We show that a higher elasticity of substitution increases per capita income, the relative share of physical capital, the common growth rate and the share of human capital allocated to the production sector, and this property is not affected by the position of the elasticity of substitution - below or above one.</description>

      <title>Proportional Response Dynamics in Gross Substitutes Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proportional response is a well-established distributed algorithm which has been shown to converge to competitive equilibria in both Fisher and Arrow-Debreu markets, for various sub-families of homogeneous utilities, including linear and constant elasticity of substitution utilities. We propose a natural generalization of proportional response for gross substitutes utilities, and prove that it converges to competitive equilibria in Fisher markets. This is the first convergence result of a proportional response style dynamics in Fisher markets for utilities beyond the homogeneous utilities covered by the Eisenberg-Gale convex program. We show an empirical convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ for the prices. Furthermore, we show that the allocations of a lazy version of the generalized proportional response dynamics converge to competitive equilibria in Arrow-Debreu markets.</description>

      <title>Consumer Welfare under Individual Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Welfare effects of price changes are often estimated with cross-sections; however, such data do not identify demand models with heterogeneous consumers. We develop a method that leverages moments of demand to construct a local approximation to the curvature of the expenditure function, which is essential for welfare analysis. Our method applies to arbitrary cross-sections and delivers a nonparametric approximation to the entire distribution of consumer welfare, robust to unobserved preference heterogeneity. We provide moment- and quantile-based estimation strategies that are simple to implement.</description>

      <title>Flexible Demand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a simple framework to analyze how targeted persuasive advertising shapes market power and welfare. A designer flexibly manipulates the demand curve by influencing individual valuations at a cost. A monopolist prices against this manipulated demand curve. We fully characterize the form of optimal advertising plans under ex-ante and ex-post welfare measures. Flexibility per se is powerful, and can substantially harm or benefit consumers vis-a-vis uniform advertising. We discuss implications for regulation, intermediation, and the joint design of manipulation and information.</description>

      <title>A monotone solution to the problem of bargaining with transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a solution to the problem of bargaining with transfers, along with an axiomatisation of the solution. Each player receives a weighted average of her contributions to each coalition's claim, where a coalition's claim is determined by its best allocation in the bargaining set. The key axioms are additivity and a property we call marginal monotonicity, which states that increasing a player's payoff in an allocation of the bargaining set, either outright or by means of transfers from other players, must benefit that player.</description>

      <title>Collective Intelligence in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit DeGroot learning to examine the robustness of social learning in dynamic networks -- networks that evolve randomly over time. Dynamics have double-edged effects depending on social structure: while they can foster consensus and boost collective intelligence in "sparse" networks, they can have adverse effects such as slowing down the speed of learning and causing long-run disagreement in "well-connected" networks. Collective intelligence arises in dynamic networks when average influence and trust remain balanced as society grows. We also find that the initial social structure of a dynamic network plays a central role in shaping long-run beliefs. We then propose a robust measure of homophily based on the likelihood of the worst network fragmentation.</description>

      <title>An Isotonic Mechanism for Overlapping Ownership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of improving peer review at large scientific conferences, this paper studies how to elicit self-evaluations to improve review scores in a natural many-to-many owner-item (e.g., author-paper) situation with overlapping ownership. We design a simple, efficient and truthful mechanism to elicit self-evaluations from item owners that can be used to calibrate their noisy review scores in the existing evaluation process (e.g., papers' review scores from peers).
  Our approach starts by partitioning the owner-item relation structure into disjoint blocks, each sharing a common set of co-owners. We then elicit the ranking of items from each owner and employ isotonic regression to produce adjusted item scores, aligning with both the reported rankings and raw item review scores. We prove that truth-telling by all owners is a payoff dominant Nash equilibrium for any valid partition of the overlapping ownership sets under natural conditions. Moreover, the truthfulness depends on eliciting rankings independently within each block, making block partition optimization crucial for improving statistical efficiency. Despite being computationally intractable in general, we develop a nearly linear-time greedy algorithm that provably finds a performant block partition with appealing robust approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world conference review data demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in a pressing real-world problem.</description>
