      <title>Gaussian process regression with additive periodic kernels for two-body interaction analysis in coupled phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Gaussian process regression framework with additive periodic kernels for the analysis of two-body interactions in coupled oscillator systems. While finite-order Fourier expansions determined by Bayesian methods can still yield artifacts such as a high-amplitude, high-frequency vibration, our additive periodic kernel approach has been demonstrated to effectively circumvent these issues. Furthermore, by exploiting the additive and periodic nature of the coupling functions, we significantly reduce the effective dimensionality of the inference problem. We first validate our method on simple coupled phase oscillators and demonstrate its robustness to more complex systems, including Van der Pol and FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, under conditions of biased or limited data. We next apply our approach to spiking neural networks modeled by Hodgkin-Huxley equations, in which we successfully recover the underlying interaction functions. These results highlight the flexibility and stability of Gaussian process regression in capturing nonlinear, periodic interactions in oscillator networks. Our framework provides a practical alternative to conventional methods, enabling data-driven studies of synchronized rhythmic systems across physics, biology, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for phase locking of synchronized oscillator populations via dynamical reduction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for controlling the collective phase of a system of coupled oscillators described by the Kuramoto model under the influence of a periodic external input by combining the methods of dynamical reduction and optimal control. We employ the Ott-Antonsen ansatz and phase-amplitude reduction theory to derive a pair of one-dimensional equations for the collective phase and amplitude of mutually synchronized oscillators. We then use optimal control theory to derive the optimal input for controlling the collective phase based on the phase equation and evaluate the effect of the control input on the degree of mutual synchrony using the amplitude equation. We set up an optimal control problem for the system to quickly resynchronize with the periodic input after a sudden phase shift in the periodic input, a situation similar to jet lag, and demonstrate the validity of the framework through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing disorder with machine learning to harness synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder is often considered detrimental to coherence. However, under specific conditions, it can enhance synchronization. We develop a machine-learning framework to design optimal disorder configurations that maximize phase synchronization. In particular, utilizing the system of coupled nonlinear pendulums with disorder and noise, we train a feedforward neural network (FNN), with the disorder parameters as input, to predict the Shannon entropy index that quantifies the phase synchronization strength. The trained FNN model is then deployed to search for the optimal disorder configurations in the high-dimensional space of the disorder parameters, providing a computationally efficient replacement of the stochastic differential equation solvers. Our results demonstrate that the FNN is capable of accurately predicting synchronization and facilitates an efficient inverse design solution to optimizing and enhancing synchronization.</description>

      <title>The Exploratory Study on the Relationship Between the Failure of Distance Metrics in High-Dimensional Space and Emergent Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, integrating information theory and statistical mechanics, to connect metric failure in high-dimensional data with emergence in complex systems. We propose the "Information Dilution Theorem," demonstrating that as dimensionality ($d$) increases, the mutual information efficiency between geometric metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) and system states decays approximately as $O(1/d)$. This decay arises from the mismatch between linearly growing system entropy and sublinearly growing metric entropy, explaining the mechanism behind distance concentration. Building on this, we introduce information structural complexity ($C(S)$) based on the mutual information matrix spectrum and interaction encoding capacity ($C'$) derived from information bottleneck theory. The "Emergence Critical Theorem" states that when $C(S)$ exceeds $C'$, new global features inevitably emerge, satisfying a predefined mutual information threshold. This provides an operational criterion for self-organization and phase transitions. We discuss potential applications in physics, biology, and deep learning, suggesting potential directions like MI-based manifold learning (UMAP+) and offering a quantitative foundation for analyzing emergence across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Entropically Driven Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populations of agents often exhibit surprising collective behavior emerging from simple local interactions. The common belief is that the agents must posses a certain level of cognitive abilities for such an emerging collective behavior to occur. However, contrary to this assumption, it is also well known that even noncognitive agents are capable of displaying nontrivial behavior. Here we consider an intermediate case, where the agents borrow a little bit from both extremes. We assume a population of agents performing random-walk in a bounded environment, on a square lattice. The agents can sense their immediate neighborhood, and they will attempt to move into a randomly selected empty site, by avoiding collisions.Also, the agents will temporary stop moving when they are in contact with at least two other agents. We show that surprisingly, such a rudimentary population of agents undergoes a percolation phase transition and self-organizes in a large polymer like structure, as a consequence of an attractive entropic force emerging from their restricted-valence and local spatial arrangement.</description>

      <title>Stability Control of Metastable States as a Unified Mechanism for Flexible Temporal Modulation in Cognitive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible modulation of temporal dynamics in neural sequences underlies many cognitive processes. For instance, we can adaptively change the speed of motor sequences and speech. While such flexibility is influenced by various factors such as attention and context, the common neural mechanisms responsible for this modulation remain poorly understood. We developed a biologically plausible neural network model that incorporates neurons with multiple timescales and Hebbian learning rules. This model is capable of generating simple sequential patterns as well as performing delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks that require the retention of stimulus identity. Fast neural dynamics establish metastable states, while slow neural dynamics maintain task-relevant information and modulate the stability of these states to enable temporal processing. We systematically analyzed how factors such as neuronal gain, external input strength (contextual cues), and task difficulty influence the temporal properties of neural activity sequences - specifically, dwell time within patterns and transition times between successive patterns. We found that these factors flexibly modulate the stability of metastable states. Our findings provide a unified mechanism for understanding various forms of temporal modulation and suggest a novel computational role for neural timescale diversity in dynamically adapting cognitive performance to changing environmental demands.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this paper, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we first show that almost all learned periods are unstable, and each network has its own characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). The latently acquired dynamics, which are unstable within the trained network, serve as a foundation for the diversity of characteristic attractors and may even lead to the emergence of attractors of all periods after learning. When the neural network interpolation is quadratic, a universal post-learning bifurcation scenario appears, which is consistent with a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map. In addition to universality, we explore specific properties of certain networks, including the singular behavior of the scale of weight at the infinite limit, the finite-size effects, and the symmetry in learning period three.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and Excitable Dynamics in an Opinion Model with Group Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of opinion dynamics, each agent in a network has an opinion and changes in opinions arise from pairwise (i.e., dyadic) interactions between agents. However, in many situations, groups of individuals possess a collective opinion that can differ from the opinions of its constituent individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show -- both numerically and via our mean-field description -- that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated. Our results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can have important effects on collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>
