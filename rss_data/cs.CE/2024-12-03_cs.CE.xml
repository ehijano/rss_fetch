      <title>Bayesian FFT Modal Identification for Multi-setup Experimental Modal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In full-scale forced vibration tests, the demand often arises to capture high-spatial-resolution mode shapes with limited number of sensors and shakers. Multi-setup experimental modal analysis (EMA) addresses this challenge by roving sensors and shakers across multiple setups. To enable fast and accurate multi-setup EMA, this paper develops a Bayesian modal identification strategy by extending an existing single-setup algorithm. Specifically, a frequency-domain probabilistic model is first formulated using multiple sets of structural multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) vibration data. A constrained Laplace method is then employed for Bayesian posterior approximation, providing the maximum a posteriori estimates of modal parameters along with a posterior covariance matrix (PCM) for uncertainty quantification. Utilizing complex matrix calculus, analytical expressions are derived for parameter updates in the coordinate descent optimization, as well as for PCM computation, enhancing both coding simplicity and computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm is intensively validated by investigating empirical examples with synthetic and field data. It demonstrates that the proposed method yields highly consistent results compared to scenarios with adequate test equipment. The resulting high-fidelity MIMO model enables structural response prediction under future loading conditions and supports condition assessment.</description>

      <title>Option Pricing with Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of neural networks, methods for option pricing have evolved significantly. This study employs the Black-Scholes-Merton (B-S-M) model, incorporating an additional variable to improve the accuracy of predictions compared to the traditional Black-Scholes (B-S) model. Furthermore, Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Conv-KANs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are introduced to demonstrate that networks with enhanced non-linear capabilities yield superior fitting performance. For comparative analysis, Conv-LSTM and LSTM models, which are widely used in time series forecasting, are also applied. Additionally, a novel data selection strategy is proposed to simulate a real trading environment, thereby enhancing the robustness of the model.</description>

      <title>DeFi: Concepts and Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi) by examining its foundational concepts, research trends, and ecosystem. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify thematic clusters and track the evolution of DeFi research. Additionally, a thematic review was performed to analyze the roles and interactions of key participants within the DeFi ecosystem, focusing on its opportunities and inherent risks. The bibliometric analysis identified a progression in research priorities, transitioning from an initial focus on technological innovation to addressing sustainability, environmental impacts, and regulatory challenges. Key thematic clusters include decentralization, smart contracts, tokenization, and sustainability concerns. The analysis of participants highlighted the roles of developers, liquidity providers, auditors, and regulators while identifying critical risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidity constraints, and regulatory uncertainties. The study underlines the transformative potential of DeFi to enhance financial inclusion and transparency while emphasizing the need for robust security frameworks and regulatory oversight to ensure long-term stability. This paper comprehensively explains the DeFi ecosystem by integrating bibliometric and thematic analyses. It offers valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, contributing to the ongoing discourse on the sustainable development and integration of DeFi into the global financial system.</description>

      <title>An efficient slope stability algorithm with physically consistent parametrisation of slip surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimised algorithm implementing the method of slices for analysing the stability of slopes. The algorithm adopts an improved physically based parameterisation of slip lines according to their geometrical characteristics at the endpoints, which facilitates the identification of all viable failure mechanisms while excluding unrealistic ones. The minimisation routine combines a preliminary discrete calculation of the factor of safety over a coarse grid covering the above parameter space with a subsequent continuous exploration of the most promising region via the simplex optimisation. This reduces computational time up to about 92% compared to conventional approaches that rely on the discrete calculation of the factor of safety over a fine grid covering the entire search space. Significant savings of computational time are observed with respect to recently published heuristic algorithms, which enable a continuous exploration of the entire parametric space. These efficiency gains are particularly advantageous for numerically demanding applications like, for example, the statistical assessment of slopes with uncertain mechanical, hydraulic and geometrical properties. The novel physically based parametrisation of the slip geometry and the adoption of a continuous local search allow exploration of parameter combinations that are necessarily neglected by standard grid-based approaches, leading to an average improvement in accuracy of about 5%.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monte Carlo: Harnessing Diffusion Models to Simulate Financial Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating synthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic data produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in several key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for portfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across quantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data. Moreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market data exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated covariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for use as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an efficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks with Hybrid Regularization for Nonlinear Dynamics Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) have shown great potential in modelling nonlinear dynamic systems with uncertainties. This paper presents an RSCN with hybrid regularization to enhance both the learning capacity and generalization performance of the network. Given a set of temporal data, the well-known least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is employed to identify the significant order variables. Subsequently, an improved RSCN with L2 regularization is introduced to approximate the residuals between the output of the target plant and the LASSO model. The output weights are updated in real-time through a projection algorithm, facilitating a rapid response to dynamic changes within the system. A theoretical analysis of the universal approximation property is provided, contributing to the understanding of the network's effectiveness in representing various complex nonlinear functions. Experimental results from a nonlinear system identification problem and two industrial predictive tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other models across all testing datasets.</description>

      <title>The Muon Space GNSS-R Surface Soil Moisture Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon Space (Muon) is building a constellation of small satellites, many of which will carry global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R) receivers. In preparation for the launch of this constellation, we have developed a generalized deep learning retrieval pipeline, which now produces operational GNSS-R near-surface soil moisture retrievals using data from NASA's Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission. In this article, we describe the input datasets, preprocessing methods, model architecture, development methods, and detail the soil moisture products generated from these retrievals. The performance of this product is quantified against in situ measurements and compared to both the target dataset (retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) satellite) and the v1.0 soil moisture product from the CYGNSS mission. The Muon Space product achieves improvements in spatial resolution over SMAP with comparable performance in many regions. An ubRMSE of 0.032 cm$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ for in situ soil moisture observations from SMAP core validation sites is shown, though performance is lower than SMAP's when comparing in forests and/or mountainous terrain. The Muon Space product outperforms the v1.0 CYGNSS soil moisture product in almost all aspects. This initial release serves as the foundation of our operational soil moisture product, which soon will additionally include data from Muon Space satellites.</description>

      <title>ONION: Physics-Informed Deep Learning Model for Line Integral Diagnostics Across Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Physics-Informed model architecture that can be adapted to various backbone networks. The model incorporates physical information as additional input and is constrained by a Physics-Informed loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that the additional input of physical information substantially improve the model's ability with a increase in performance observed. Besides, the adoption of the Softplus activation function in the final two fully connected layers significantly enhances model performance. The incorporation of a Physics-Informed loss function has been shown to correct the model's predictions, bringing the back-projections closer to the actual inputs and reducing the errors associated with inversion algorithms. In this work, we have developed a Phantom Data Model to generate customized line integral diagnostic datasets and have also collected SXR diagnostic datasets from EAST and HL-2A. The code, models, and some datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/calledice/onion.</description>

      <title>Predicting Extubation Failure in Intensive Care: The Development of a Novel, End-to-End Actionable and Interpretable Prediction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting extubation failure in intensive care is challenging due to complex data and the severe consequences of inaccurate predictions. Machine learning shows promise in improving clinical decision-making but often fails to account for temporal patient trajectories and model interpretability, highlighting the need for innovative solutions.
  This study aimed to develop an actionable, interpretable prediction system for extubation failure using temporal modelling approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). A retrospective cohort study of 4,701 mechanically ventilated patients from the MIMIC-IV database was conducted. Data from the 6 hours before extubation, including static and dynamic features, were processed through novel techniques addressing data inconsistency and synthetic data challenges. Feature selection was guided by clinical relevance and literature benchmarks.
  Iterative experimentation involved training LSTM, TCN, and LightGBM models. Initial results showed a strong bias toward predicting extubation success, despite advanced hyperparameter tuning and static data inclusion. Data was stratified by sampling frequency to reduce synthetic data impacts, leading to a fused decision system with improved performance. However, all architectures yielded modest predictive power (AUC-ROC ~0.6; F1 &lt;0.5) with no clear advantage in incorporating static data or additional features. Ablation analysis indicated minimal impact of individual features on model performance.
  This thesis highlights the challenges of synthetic data in extubation failure prediction and introduces strategies to mitigate bias, including clinician-informed preprocessing and novel feature subsetting. While performance was limited, the study provides a foundation for future work, emphasising the need for reliable, interpretable models to optimise ICU outcomes.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Based Prediction of B-Cell Epitopes for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: Enhancing Vaccine Design through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of B-cell epitopes is critical for guiding vaccine development against infectious diseases, including SARS and COVID-19. This study explores the use of a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict B-cell epitopes for SARS-CoVandSARS-CoV-2,leveraging a dataset that incorporates essential protein and peptide features. Traditional sequence-based methods often struggle with large, complex datasets, but deep learning offers promising improvements in predictive accuracy. Our model employs regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping, to enhance generalization, while also analyzing key features, including isoelectric point and aromaticity, that influence epitope recognition. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 82% in predicting COVID-19 negative and positive cases, with room for improvement in detecting positive samples. This research demonstrates the applicability of deep learning in epitope mapping, suggesting that such approaches can enhance the speed and precision of vaccine design for emerging pathogens. Future work could incorporate structural data and diverse viral strains to further refine prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Decoder network for inverse prediction of capacitor electrostatic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional electrostatic simulation are meshed-based methods which convert partial differential equations into an algebraic system of equations and their solutions are approximated through numerical methods. These methods are time consuming and any changes in their initial or boundary conditions will require solving the numerical problem again. Newer computational methods such as the physics informed neural net (PINN) similarly require re-training when boundary conditions changes. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach to model parameter changes to the boundary conditions. The proposed method is demonstrated on the test problem of a long air-filled capacitor structure. The proposed approach is compared to plain vanilla deep learning (NN) and PINN. It is shown that our method can significantly outperform both NN and PINN under dynamic boundary condition as well as retaining its full capability as a forward model.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Large Time Series Models for Prediction of Wind Turbine SCADA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable achievements of large models in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have sparked interest in their application to time series forecasting within industrial contexts. This paper explores the application of a pre-trained large time series model, Timer, which was initially trained on a wide range of time series data from multiple domains, in the prediction of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data collected from wind turbines. The model was fine-tuned on SCADA datasets sourced from two wind farms, which exhibited differing characteristics, and its accuracy was subsequently evaluated. Additionally, the impact of data volume was studied to evaluate the few-shot ability of the Timer. Finally, an application study on one-turbine fine-tuning for whole-plant prediction was implemented where both few-shot and cross-turbine generalization capacity is required. The results reveal that the pre-trained large model does not consistently outperform other baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy whenever the data is abundant or not, but demonstrates superior performance in the application study. This result underscores the distinctive advantages of the pre-trained large time series model in facilitating swift deployment.</description>

      <title>Graph-to-SFILES: Control structure prediction from process topologies using generative artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control structure design is an important but tedious step in P&amp;ID development. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P&amp;ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&amp;ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the system description of our entry for the COLING 2025 FMD challenge, focusing on misinformation detection in financial domains. We experimented with a combination of large language models, including Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma-2, and leveraged pre-processing and sequential learning for not only identifying fraudulent financial content but also generating coherent, and concise explanations that clarify the rationale behind the classifications. Our approach achieved competitive results with an F1-score of 0.8283 for classification, and ROUGE-1 of 0.7253 for explanations. This work highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in financial applications, offering insights into their capabilities for combating misinformation and enhancing transparency while identifying areas for future improvement in robustness and domain adaptation.</description>

Abstract: Deep generative models have achieved tremendous success in structure-based drug design in recent years, especially for generating 3D ligand molecules that bind to specific protein pocket. Notably, diffusion models have transformed ligand generation by providing exceptional quality and creativity. However, traditional diffusion models are restricted by their conventional learning objectives, which limit their broader applicability. In this work, we propose a new framework FlowSBDD, which is based on rectified flow model, allows us to flexibly incorporate additional loss to optimize specific target and introduce additional condition either as an extra input condition or replacing the initial Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 show that our approach could achieve state-of-the-art performance on generating high-affinity molecules while maintaining proper molecular properties without specifically designing binding site, with up to -8.50 Avg. Vina Dock score and 75.0% Diversity.</description>

      <title>Superhypergraph Neural Networks and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks: Theoretical Foundations</title>

Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional graphs by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, while superhypergraphs further generalize this concept to represent even more complex relationships. Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</description>

      <title>Fire-Image-DenseNet (FIDN) for predicting wildfire burnt area using remote sensing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the extent of massive wildfires once ignited is essential to reduce the subsequent socioeconomic losses and environmental damage, but challenging because of the complexity of fire behaviour. Existing physics-based models are limited in predicting large or long-duration wildfire events. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based predictive model, Fire-Image-DenseNet (FIDN), that uses spatial features derived from both near real-time and reanalysis data on the environmental and meteorological drivers of wildfire. We trained and tested this model using more than 300 individual wildfires that occurred between 2012 and 2019 in the western US. In contrast to existing models, the performance of FIDN does not degrade with fire size or duration. Furthermore, it predicts final burnt area accurately even in very heterogeneous landscapes in terms of fuel density and flammability. The FIDN model showed higher accuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) about 82% and 67% lower than those of the predictive models based on cellular automata (CA) and the minimum travel time (MTT) approaches, respectively. Its structural similarity index measure (SSIM) averages 97%, outperforming the CA and FlamMap MTT models by 6% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, FIDN is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than both CA and MTT models. The enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy advancements offer vital insights for strategic planning and resource allocation for firefighting operations.</description>

      <title>CSP-AIT-Net: A contrastive learning-enhanced spatiotemporal graph attention framework for short-term metro OD flow prediction with asynchronous inflow tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate origin-destination (OD) passenger flow prediction is crucial for enhancing metro system efficiency, optimizing scheduling, and improving passenger experiences. However, current models often fail to effectively capture the asynchronous departure characteristics of OD flows and underutilize the inflow and outflow data, which limits their prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we propose CSP-AIT-Net, a novel spatiotemporal graph attention framework designed to enhance OD flow prediction by incorporating asynchronous inflow tracking and advanced station semantics representation. Our framework restructures the OD flow prediction paradigm by first predicting outflows and then decomposing OD flows using a spatiotemporal graph attention mechanism. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a masking mechanism and propose asynchronous passenger flow graphs that integrate inflow and OD flow with conservation constraints. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning to extract high-dimensional land use semantics of metro stations, enriching the contextual understanding of passenger mobility patterns. Validation of the Shanghai metro system demonstrates improvement in short-term OD flow prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes to enhancing metro operational efficiency, scheduling precision, and overall system safety.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Utilization as a Plasma Source for Magnetohydrodynamic Direct Power Extraction (MHD-DPE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the suitability of hydrogen-based plasma in direct power extraction (DPE) as a non-conventional electricity generation method. We apply computational modeling and principles in physics and chemistry to estimate different thermal and electric properties of a water-vapor/nitrogen/cesium-vapor (H2O/N2/Cs) gas mixture with different levels of cesium (Cs) at a fixed temperature of 2300 K (2026.85 {\deg}C). This gas mixture and temperature are selected because they resemble the stoichiometric combustion of hydrogen with air, followed by the addition of the alkali metal element cesium to allow ionization, thus converting the gas mixture into electrically conducting plasma. We vary the cesium mole fraction in the gas mixture by two orders of magnitude, from a minute amount of 0.0625% (1/1600) to a major amount of 16% (0.16). We use these results to further estimate the theoretical upper limit of the electric power output from a unit volume of a high-speed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel, with the plasma accelerated inside it to twice the local speed of sound (Mach number 2) while subject to an applied magnetic field of 5 T (5 teslas). We report that there is an optimum cesium mole fraction of 3%, at which the power output is maximized. Per 1 m3 of plasma volume, the estimated theoretical electric power generation at 1 atm (101.325 kPa) pressure of the hydrogen-combustion mixture is extraordinarily high at 360 MW/m3, and the plasma electric conductivity is 17.5 S/m. This estimated power generation even reaches an impressive level of 1.15 GW/m3 (11500 MW/m3) if the absolute pressure can be decreased to 0.0625 atm (6.333 kPa), at which the electric conductivity exceeds 55 S/m (more than 10 times the electric conductivity of seawater).</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Collatz-Weyl Generators, a family of uniform pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) which are based on generalized Collatz mappings, derived from the Collatz conjecture and Weyl sequences. The high-quality statistical properties of our generators is demonstrated by the fact that they pass stringent randomness tests used by the research and standardization community. The proposed Collatz-Weyl Generators have a number of important properties, including solid mathematical foundations, enablement of high throughput and low latency implementation, small code and/or ASIC size, enablement of producing multiple independent streams and potential of support of cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Data-Driven and Theory-Driven Modelling -- Leveraging Causal Machine Learning for Integrative Modelling of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical machine learning techniques often struggle with overfitting and unreliable predictions when exposed to novel conditions. Introducing causality into the modelling process offers a promising way to mitigate these challenges by enhancing interpretability and predictive reliability. However, constructing an initial causal graph manually using domain knowledge is a time-consuming, particularly in complex time series with numerous variables. To address this, causal discovery algorithms can provide a preliminary causal structure that domain experts can refine. This study investigates causal feature selection with domain knowledge using a data centre system as an example. We use simulated time-series data to compare different causal feature selection with traditional machine-learning feature selection methods. Our results show that predictions based on causal features are more robust and interpretable compared to those derived from traditional methods. These findings underscore the potential of combining causal discovery algorithms with human expertise to improve machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Medical Image Generation Based on Pyramid Convolutional Attention Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of multimodal medical imaging can provide complementary and comprehensive information for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in clinical practice, since positron emission tomography (PET) is often missing, multimodal images might be incomplete. To address this problem, we propose a method that can efficiently utilize structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) image information to generate high-quality PET images. Our generation model efficiently utilizes pyramid convolution combined with channel attention mechanism to extract multi-scale local features in sMRI, and injects global correlation information into these features using self-attention mechanism to ensure the restoration of the generated PET image on local texture and global structure. Additionally, we introduce additional loss functions to guide the generation model in producing higher-quality PET images. Through experiments conducted on publicly available ADNI databases, the generated images outperform previous research methods in various performance indicators (average absolute error: 0.0194, peak signal-to-noise ratio: 29.65, structural similarity: 0.9486) and are close to real images. In promoting AD diagnosis, the generated images combined with their corresponding sMRI also showed excellent performance in AD diagnosis tasks (classification accuracy: 94.21 %), and outperformed previous research methods of the same type. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other competing methods in quantitative metrics, qualitative visualization, and evaluation criteria.</description>

      <title>A Game-theoretic model of forex trading with stochastic strategies and information asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction strategies for reward in competitive environments are significantly influenced by the nature and extent of available information. In financial markets, particularly foreign exchange (forex), traders operate independently with limited information, often yielding highly unpredictable outcomes. This study introduces a game-theoretic framework modeling the market as a strategically active participant, rather than a neutral entity, within a stochastic, imperfect information setting. In this model, the market alternates sequentially with new traders, each trader having limited visibility of the market's moves, while the market observes and counteracts each trader strategy. Through a series of simulations, we show that this information asymmetry enables the market to consistently outperform traders on aggregate. This outcome suggests that real-world forex environments may inherently favor market structures with greater informational advantage, challenging the perception of a level playing field. The model provides a basis for simulating skewed information environments, highlighting how strategic imbalances contribute to trader losses. Further optimization of the intelligent market scoring and refined simulations of trader-market interactions can enhance predictive analytics for forex, offering a robust tool for market behavior analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraining Generative Models for Engineering Design with Negative Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have recently achieved remarkable success and widespread adoption in society, yet they often struggle to generate realistic and accurate outputs. This challenge extends beyond language and vision into fields like engineering design, where safety-critical engineering standards and non-negotiable physical laws tightly constrain what outputs are considered acceptable. In this work, we introduce a novel training method to guide a generative model toward constraint-satisfying outputs using `negative data' -- examples of what to avoid. Our negative-data generative model (NDGM) formulation easily outperforms classic models, generating 1/6 as many constraint-violating samples using 1/8 as much data in certain problems. It also consistently outperforms other baselines, achieving a balance between constraint satisfaction and distributional similarity that is unsurpassed by any other model in 12 of the 14 problems tested. This widespread superiority is rigorously demonstrated across numerous synthetic tests and real engineering problems, such as ship hull synthesis with hydrodynamic constraints and vehicle design with impact safety constraints. Our benchmarks showcase both the best-in-class performance of our new NDGM formulation and the overall dominance of NDGMs versus classic generative models. We publicly release the code and benchmarks at https://github.com/Lyleregenwetter/NDGMs.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic degrees of freedom are instrumental in antenna design, wireless communications, imaging, and scattering. Larger number of degrees of freedom enhances control in antenna design, influencing radiation patterns and directivity, while in communication systems, it links to spatial channels for increased data rates and reliability, and resolution in imaging. The correlation between computed degrees of freedom and physical quantities is not fully understood, prompting a comparison between classical estimates, Weyl's law, modal expansions, and optimization techniques. In this paper, it is shown that the number of degrees of freedom for arbitrary shaped radiating structures approaches the shadow area measured in squared wavelengths asymptotically as the wavelength decreases.</description>

      <title>Bike network planning in limited urban space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of cycling infrastructure in urban environments hinders the adoption of cycling as a viable mode for commuting, despite the evident benefits of (e-)bikes as sustainable, efficient, and health-promoting transportation modes. Bike network planning is a tedious process, relying on heuristic computational methods that frequently overlook the broader implications of introducing new cycling infrastructure, in particular the necessity to repurpose car lanes. In this work, we call for optimizing the trade-off between bike and car networks, effectively pushing for Pareto optimality. This shift in perspective gives rise to a novel linear programming formulation towards optimal bike network allocation. Our experiments, conducted using both real-world and synthetic data, testify the effectiveness and superiority of this optimization approach compared to heuristic methods. In particular, the framework provides stakeholders with a range of lane reallocation scenarios, illustrating potential bike network enhancements and their implications for car infrastructure. Crucially, our approach is adaptable to various bikeability and car accessibility evaluation criteria, making our tool a highly flexible and scalable resource for urban planning. This paper presents an advanced decision-support framework that can significantly aid urban planners in making informed decisions on cycling infrastructure development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance. Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary field aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We introduce a task of generating question-passages pairs, where questions are automatically created and paired with relevant regulatory passages, facilitating the development of regulatory question-answering systems. We create the ObliQA dataset, containing 27,869 questions derived from the collection of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation documents, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation (RIRAG) system and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations while avoiding contradictions.</description>
