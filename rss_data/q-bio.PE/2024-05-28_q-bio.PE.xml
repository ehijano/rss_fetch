      <title>Neutral phylogenetic models and their role in tree-based biodiversity measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of stochastic models of cladogenesis (based on speciation and extinction) lead to an identical distribution on phylogenetic tree shapes once the edge lengths are ignored. By contrast, the distribution of the tree's edge lengths is generally quite sensitive to the underlying model. In this paper, we review the impact of different model choices on tree shape and edge length distribution, and its impact for studying the properties of phylogenetic diversity (PD) as a measure of biodiversity, and the loss of PD as species become extinct at the present. We also compare PD with a stochastic model of feature diversity, and investigate some mathematical links and inequalities between these two measures plus their predictions concerning the loss of biodiversity under extinction at the present.</description>

      <title>Sparsification of Phylogenetic Covariance Matrices of $k$-Regular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a tree $T=(V,E)$ with root $\circ$ and edge length function $\ell:E\to\mathbb{R}_+$. The phylogenetic covariance matrix of $T$ is the matrix $C$ with rows and columns indexed by $L$, the leaf set of $T$, with entries $C(i,j):=\sum_{e\in[i\wedge j,o]}\ell(e)$, for each $i,j\in L$. Recent work [15] has shown that the phylogenetic covariance matrix of a large, random binary tree $T$ is significantly sparsified with overwhelmingly high probability under a change-of-basis with respect to the so-called Haar-like wavelets of $T$. This finding notably enables manipulating the spectrum of covariance matrices of large binary trees without the necessity to store them in computer memory but instead performing two post-order traversals of the tree. Building on the methods of [15], this manuscript further advances their sparsification result to encompass the broader class of $k$-regular trees, for any given $k\ge2$. This extension is achieved by refining existing asymptotic formulas for the mean and variance of the internal path length of random $k$-regular trees, utilizing hypergeometric function properties and identities.</description>

      <title>Antigenic Cooperation in Viral Populations: Redistribution of Loads Among Altruistic Viruses and Maximal Load per Altruist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper continues the study of the phenomenon of local immunodeficiency (LI) in viral cross-immunoreactivity networks, with a focus on the roles and interactions between altruistic and persistent viral variants. As always, only the state of stable (i.e. observable) LI is analysed. First, we show that a single altruistic viral variant has an upper limit for the number of persistent viral variants that it can support. Our findings reveal that in viral cross-immunoreactivity networks, altruistic viruses act essentially autonomously from each other. Namely, connections between altruistic viruses do not change neither their qualitative roles, nor the quantitative values of the strengths of their connections in the CRNs. In other words, each altruistic virus does exactly the same actions and with the same strengths with or without presence of other altruistic viruses. However, having more altruistic viruses allows to keep sizes of populations of persistent viruses at the higher levels. Likewise, the strength of the immune response against any altruistic virus remains at the same constant level regardless of how many persistent viruses this altruistic virus supports, i.e. shields from the immune response of the host's immune system. It is also shown that viruses strongly compete with each other in order to become persistent in the state of stable LI. We also present an example for a CRN with stable LI that only consists of persistent viral variants.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Altruistic Punishment with a PDE Model of Cultural Multilevel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two mechanisms that have been used to study the evolution of cooperative behavior are altruistic punishment, in which cooperative individuals pay additional costs to punish defection, and multilevel selection, in which competition between groups can help to counteract individual-level incentives to cheat. Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson have used simulation models of cultural evolution to suggest that altruistic punishment and pairwise group-level competition can work in concert to promote cooperation, even when neither mechanism can do so on its own. In this paper, we formulate a PDE model for multilevel selection motivated by the approach of Boyd and coauthors, modeling individual-level birth-death competition with a replicator equation based on individual payoffs and describing group-level competition with pairwise conflicts based on differences in the average payoffs of the competing groups. Building off of existing PDE models for multilevel selection with frequency-independent group-level competition, we use analytical and numerical techniques to understand how the forms of individual and average payoffs can impact the long-time ability to sustain altruistic punishment in group-structured populations. We find several interesting differences between the behavior of our new PDE model with pairwise group-level competition and existing multilevel PDE models, including the observation that our new model can feature a non-monotonic dependence of the long-time collective payoff on the strength of altruistic punishment. Going forward, our PDE framework can serve as a way to connect and compare disparate approaches for understanding multilevel selection across the literature in evolutionary biology and anthropology.</description>

      <title>Mutation-Bias Learning in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two variants of a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on evolutionary game theoretic considerations. The intentional simplicity of one variant enables us to prove results on its relationship to a system of ordinary differential equations of replicator-mutator dynamics type, allowing us to present proofs on the algorithm's convergence conditions in various settings via its ODE counterpart. The more complicated variant enables comparisons to Q-learning based algorithms. We compare both variants experimentally to WoLF-PHC and frequency-adjusted Q-learning on a range of settings, illustrating cases of increasing dimensionality where our variants preserve convergence in contrast to more complicated algorithms. The availability of analytic results provides a degree of transferability of results as compared to purely empirical case studies, illustrating the general utility of a dynamical systems perspective on multi-agent reinforcement learning when addressing questions of convergence and reliable generalisation.</description>

      <title>Disease Transmission on Random Graphs Using Edge-Based Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge-based percolation methods can be used to analyze disease transmission on complex social networks. This allows us to include complex social heterogeneity in our models while maintaining tractability. Here we review the seminal works on this field by Newman et al (2001); Newman (2002, 2003), and Miller et al (2012). We present a systematic discussion of the theoretical background behind these models, including an extensive derivation of the major results. We also connect these results relate back to the classical literature in random graph theory Molloy and Reed (1995, 1998). Finally, we also present an accompanying R package that takes epidemic and network parameters as input and generates estimates of the epidemic trajectory and final size. This manuscript and the R package was developed to help researchers easily understand and use network models to investigate the interaction between different community structures and disease transmission.</description>

      <title>Generating-functional analysis of random Lotka-Volterra systems: A step-by-step guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides what is hopefully a self-contained set of notes describing the detailed steps of a generating-functional analysis of systems of generalised Lotka-Volterra equations with random interaction coefficients. Nothing in these notes is original, instead the generating-functional method (also known as the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominic-Janssen formalism) and the resulting dynamic mean field theories have been used for the study of disordered systems and spin glasses for decades. But it is hard to find unifying sources which would allow a beginner to learn step-by-step how these methods can be used. My aim is to provide such a source. Most of the calculations are specific to generalised Lotka-Volterra systems, but much can be transferred to disordered systems in more general.</description>
