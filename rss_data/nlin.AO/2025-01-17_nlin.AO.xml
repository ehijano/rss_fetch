      <title>Definition and data-driven reconstruction of asymptotic phase and amplitudes of stochastic oscillators via Koopman operator theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic phase and amplitudes are fundamental concepts in the analysis of limit-cycle oscillators. In this paper, we briefly review the definition of these quantities, particularly a generalization to stochastic oscillatory systems from the viewpoint of Koopman operator theory, and discuss a data-driven approach to estimate the asymptotic phase and amplitude functions from time-series data of stochastic oscillatory systems. We demonstrate that the standard Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) can successfully reconstruct the phase and amplitude functions of the noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model only from the time-series data.</description>

      <title>Bacterial proliferation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria can form a great variety of spatially heterogeneous cell density patterns, ranging from simple concentric rings to dynamical spiral waves appearing in growing colonies. These pattern formation phenomena are important as they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in heterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in simplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are externally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing example, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential formation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal population. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained obscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in simplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and timing of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of different bands can be modulated independently. This "modularity" is suggested by the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it is reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal metabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also modify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that impair selected metabolic pathways. In our opinion, the possibility of precise measurements and controls, together with the simplicity and richness of the "proliferation pattern formation" phenomenon, can make it a model system to study the response of cellular processes to heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>CrowdEgress: A Multi-Agent Simulation Platform for Pedestrian Crowd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a simulation platform to study complex crowd behavior in social context. The agent-based model is extended based on the social force model, and it mainly describes how agents interact with each other, and also with surrounding facilities such as walls, doors and exits. The simulation platform is compatible to FDS+Evac, and the input data in FDS+Evac could be imported into our simulation platform to create single-floor compartment geometry, and a flow solver is used to generate the roadmap towards exits. Most importantly, we plan to integrate advanced social and psychological theory into our simulation platform, especially investigating human behavior in emergency evacuation,such as pre-evacuation behavior, exit-selection activities, social group and herding effect and so forth.</description>
