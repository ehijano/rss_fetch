      <title>Bioinspired Synergistic Texture and Color Modulation Enabled by Surface Instability of Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain cephalopods can dynamically camouflage by altering both skin texture and color to match their surroundings. Inspired by this capability, we present a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer-liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE-LCE) bilayer capable of simultaneous, reversible modulation of surface texture and structural color through programmable wrinkling. By tuning the bilayer's fabrication parameters, on-demand wrinkle morphologies and color combinations are achieved. Spatially selective UV curing allows localized surface textures, while chemical patterning of the CLCE layer enables region-specific color responses, expanding the design space for multifunctional, spatially encoded optical materials. The CLCE-LCE bilayer enables dynamic thermal regulation by tuning light absorption through synergistically modulating surface morphology and color. Notably, this system achieves strain-dependent multiscale encoding via multistep selective UV curing, revealing distinct visual content under different applied strains. This work establishes a versatile platform that merges surface instabilities with tunable structural coloration, advancing intelligent materials with programmable, strain-responsive surface and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Towards terahertz nanomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing electromechanical resonators towards terahertz frequencies opens vast bandwidths for phononic signal processing. In quantum phononics, mechanical resonators at these frequencies can remain in their quantum ground state even at kelvin temperatures, obviating the need for millikelvin cooling typically required for GHz resonators. However, electrical actuation and detection of mechanical motion at such high frequencies present significant challenges, primarily due to the need for device miniaturization to support acoustic waves with nanometer-scale wavelengths. One effective strategy is to aggressively thin down piezoelectric thin films, ideally to a thickness on the order of the acoustic wavelength, which is in the tens of nanometers. In this work, we aggressively reduce the thickness of lithium niobate from 300 nm to 67 nm through several stages, and fabricate suspended Lamb-wave resonators at each thickness level. These resonators achieve resonant frequencies as high as 220 GHz, doubling the previous record and approaching the terahertz frequency threshold. While ultrathin films exhibit a clear advantage in frequency gains, they also experience increased acoustic losses. Our results suggest that future advances in terahertz nanomechanics will critically rely on mitigating surface defects in sub-100 nm thin films.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping Risk in Terahertz Channels by Covered Wavy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz communications offer unprecedented data rates for next-generation wireless networks but suffer blockage susceptibility that restrict coverage and introduce physical-layer security vulnerabilities. Non-line-of-sight relay schemes using metallic wavy surfaces (MWS) address coverage limitations but require concealment beneath indoor materials for practical deployment. This work investigates THz channel characteristics and security vulnerabilities when MWS surfaces are covered with wallpaper, curtain, and wall plaster across 113-170 GHz. Results reveal that covering materials redistribute rather than eliminate eavesdropping threats, with persistent feasible interception scenarios remaining undetectable through conventional backscattering monitoring. These findings underscore the need for enhanced mechanisms designed for covered reflecting elements.</description>

      <title>X-ray thermal diffuse scattering as a texture-robust temperature diagnostic for dynamically compressed solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of x-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) from a cubic polycrystal with an arbitrary crystallographic texture, based on the classic approach of Warren. We compare the predictions of our model with femtosecond x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from ambient and dynamically compressed rolled copper foils obtained at the High Energy Density (HED) instrument of the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL), and find that the texture-aware TDS model yields more accurate results than does the conventional powder model owed to Warren. Nevertheless, we further show that: with sufficient angular detector coverage, the TDS signal is largely unchanged by sample orientation and in all cases strongly resembles the signal from a perfectly random powder; shot-to-shot fluctuations in the TDS signal resulting from grain-sampling statistics are at the percent level, in stark contrast to the fluctuations in the Bragg-peak intensities (which are over an order of magnitude greater); and TDS is largely unchanged even following texture evolution caused by compression-induced plastic deformation. We conclude that TDS is robust against texture variation, making it a flexible temperature diagnostic applicable just as well to off-the-shelf commercial foils as to ideal powders.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity in Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity-the ability to transmit signals in one direction while blocking them in the reverse-has become a powerful resource in quantum technologies, enabling directional amplification, routing of quantum information, and topologically protected quantum states. Recent experimental advances have demonstrated nonreciprocal behavior in low-loss, fully integrated devices operating with weak or no magnetic bias, enabled by synthetic gauge fields, optomechanical interactions, and chiral light-matter coupling. These achievements overcome the limitations of more traditional approaches, making nonreciprocity compatible with superconducting circuits and scalable quantum photonic architectures as well as an integral part of the next generation of modular quantum computers, distributed quantum networks, and precision metrology. Here we highlight the key concepts for engineering nonreciprocity in quantum systems and describe how this functionality can be employed for high-fidelity qubit readout, robust quantum state transfer, and boosting the sensitivity of quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption of a Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ (CTS) layer trapped by metallic thin films in multilayer configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coating and reflecting thin films for energy harvesting purposes are interesting topics in both theoretical and experimental research. The thin film could help to enhance the absorption of the system via its specific optical properties depending on the optical wavelength and the stacked layer thickness. Here, by using Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields penetrating thin films, we examined in detail the absorption of a CTS layer coated by nanometer-thick thin films of several materials, Au, Ag, Cu, Al, and figured out the optimal thickness range for the outer layers of the solar cell to optimize thermal energy harvesting from the light. In particular, the absorption has been shown to be significantly enhanced thanks to the optical cavity effect, and the maximal absorption of the system could reach 60\% for ... These results could help in suitably choosing the detailed thickness for the structure of the solar cell and other energy harvesting objects.</description>

      <title>Effect of screening on Seebeck coefficient in bilayer graphene/AlGaAs electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The knowledge of Seebeck coefficient is a key factor in optimization of thermoelectric materials and finding right applications for it. A high sensitivity to structural change makes thermopower measurements an excellent technique for the study on the charge transport properties of a given material. The phonondrag term dominates at low temperature in the Seebeck coefficient This study examines the temperaturedependent screening effect on the phonondraginduced Seebeck coefficient S^g in a bilayer graphene- BLG-AlGaAs-quasi-twodimensional electron gas (q2DEG) system at the temperature below 50 K. The BLG layer interacts with both deformation potential acoustic phonons and stronger piezoelectric field acoustic phonons from AlGaAs/GaAs. We compare the electronphonon interactions in BLG with and without screening by q2DEG. The screening effect reduces particularly at low temperatures and shows a strong dependence on the carrier density in the BLG layer. The doublelayer screening function increases with layer separation d paralleling the monolayer screening at large d. Additionally varying the GaAs quantum well width reveals that increases with width less than 100 \AA under doublelayer screening but remains unchanged beyond this threshold while monolayer screening decreases as the width increases. Both screening functions enhance when the BLG carrier density is lower than that of q2DEG though the magnitude difference between them is minimal</description>

      <title>Excitation frequency dependence of noise and minimum detectable force in amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a versatile nanoscale imaging technique. Since its spatiotemporal resolution is fundamentally limited by the minimum detectable force (MDF) arising from system noise, a deep understanding of MDF is essential for improving instrumentation. However, the theoretical MDF of amplitude-modulation (AM) AFM has long remained inconsistent, with three reported expressions yielding conflicting coefficients: 1.84, 1.41, and 0.71 times those of other dynamic modes. Moreover, although we recently clarified the strong dependence of force sensitivity on the cantilever's driving frequency, previous theories overlooked this effect. Here, we present an exact solution for the MDF of AM-AFM that accounts for noise frequency dependence, excitation efficiency, and arbitrary cantilever Q-factors. Our results clarify that the coefficient strongly depends on the driving frequency and Q-factor. Notably, when driven at the resonance slope, it stays within 1 and 1.41, thus resolving this long-standing inconsistency. Our findings provide essential guidance for improving instrumentation to visualize previously inaccessible phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spinwave Bandpass Filters for 6G Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinwave filters using single-crystal yttrium iron garnet are an attractive technology for integration in frequency adjustable or tunable communication systems. However, existing SW devices do not have sufficient bandwidth for future 5G and 6G communication systems, are too large, or have strong spurious passbands creating unintentional cross-channel interference. Leveraging modern micromachining fabrication methods capable of wafer-scale production, we report a SW ladder filter architecture requiring only a single external magnetic bias. The filters demonstrate loss as low as 2.54 dB, bandwidths up to 663 MHz, center frequency tuning over multiple octaves from 7.08-21.6 GHz, and high linearity with an input referred third-order intercept point over 11 dBm in the passband. The filter's operation is also experimentally demonstrated in a frequency tunable radio system.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</description>

      <title>How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheatham NaCl model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient large-scale computer simulations of aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the complexity of these systems evidences the difficulties in describing solution properties without due account of polarization. Different strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of solvated ions. In this work, we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized to predict the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally well, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, but also surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe densities of NaCl solutions for models parametrized to their crystal and melt properties only. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and show that a robust parametrization can be achieved without invoking the concept of charge scaling.</description>

Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.</description>
