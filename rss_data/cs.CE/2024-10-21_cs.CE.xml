      <description>arXiv:2410.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand cardiac arrhythmia, computer models for electrophysiology are essential. In the EuroHPC MicroCARD project, we adapt the current models and leverage modern computing resources to model diseased hearts and their microstructure accurately. Towards this objective, we develop a portable, highly efficient, and performing BDDC preconditioner and solver implementation, demonstrating scalability with over 90% efficiency on up to 100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Aligning LLMs with Human Instructions and Stock Market Feedback in Financial Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for trading and investment decision-making. This study introduces an adaptive retrieval augmented framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that aligns with human instructions through Instruction Tuning and incorporates market feedback to dynamically adjust weights across various knowledge sources within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Building upon foundational models like LLaMA 2, we fine-tune a series of LLMs ranging from 7B to 70B in size, enriched with Instruction Tuning and RAG, and further optimized through direct feedback and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based refinement methods applied to the source weights of RAG.Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that the sentiment outputs from our LLMs more accurately mirror the intrinsic sentiment of textual data, showcasing a 1% to 6% boost in accuracy and F1 score over existing state-of-the-art models and leading conversational AI systems. Moreover, the sentiments extracted are more indicative of the directions in stock price movements. On top of that, we successfully construct portfolios that yield a 3.61% higher Sharpe ratio compared to the S&amp;P 500 baseline in bullish markets. These portfolios also demonstrate resilience in bearish markets, with a 5x reduction in return losses compared to those typically experienced by the S&amp;P 500.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relentless pursuit of technological advancements has ushered in a new era where artificial intelligence (AI) is not only a powerful tool but also a critical economic driver. At the forefront of this transformation is Generative AI, which is catalyzing a paradigm shift across industries. Deep generative models, an integration of generative and deep learning techniques, excel in creating new data beyond analyzing existing ones, revolutionizing sectors from production and manufacturing to finance. By automating design, optimization, and innovation cycles, Generative AI is reshaping core industrial processes. In the financial sector, it is transforming risk assessment, trading strategies, and forecasting, demonstrating its profound impact. This paper explores the sweeping changes driven by deep learning models like Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their potential to foster innovative business models, disruptive technologies, and novel economic landscapes. As we stand at the threshold of an AI-driven economic era, Generative AI is emerging as a pivotal force, driving innovation, disruption, and economic evolution on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Customized FinGPT Search Agents Using Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) have proven useful for analyzing financial data, but most existing models, such as BloombergGPT and FinGPT, lack customization for specific user needs. In this paper, we address this gap by developing FinGPT Search Agents tailored for two types of users: individuals and institutions. For individuals, we leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to integrate local documents and user-specified data sources. For institutions, we employ dynamic vector databases and fine-tune models on proprietary data. There are several key issues to address, including data privacy, the time-sensitive nature of financial information, and the need for fast responses. Experiments show that FinGPT agents outperform existing models in accuracy, relevance, and response time, making them practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Empower Personalized Valuation in Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auctions, a fundamental economic mechanism, encompass the valuation of goods or services and the competitive bidding algorithms within a specific framework, serving to uncover the true market value. However, current research predominantly focuses on the bidding algorithms within a given auction mechanism, often overlooking the advantages of incorporating individual bidders' unique preferences and the semantic information related to the items into the valuation process. Our analysis, both theoretical and empirical, shows that imprecise or noisy valuations can significantly affect the overall utility for participants. To bridge this gap, we propose a personalized valuation framework, namely \textbf{S}emantic-enhanced \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{V}aluation in \textbf{A}uction (\ours), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate semantic information into each bidder's unique valuation process. Specifically, SPVA employs a two-stage approach: it first fine-tunes LLMs to encode bidder preferences in personalized valuations, and then constructs a Vickrey auction environment integrated with a bidding algorithm to demonstrate that SPVA's more accurate valuations result in higher profits. Additionally, we have developed a semantic-enhanced dataset comprising over 23,000 samples and introduced new personalized evaluation metrics that reflect both bidder preferences and profit. Through simulations of various auction scenarios, our method demonstrates its ability to provide accurate valuations and capture bidder preferences, affirming the method's effectiveness in real-world auction settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial models have increasingly become popular in recent times, and the focus of researchers has been to find the perfect model which fits all circumstances; however, this has not been thoroughly achieved, and as a result, many financial models have been created. Artificial Intelligence modelling has increasingly become more popular in the financial space as an answer to the weakness of the advanced mathematical models studied in Economics. This paper introduces three commonly used models and tests them on the S&amp;P500 to give a strong projection as to the future values of the prices. It then introduces various error metrics like the root mean square error (RMSE) to ascertain the viability of the models. The results show that a longer-term forecast indeed has more arduous consequences as there is a veer between the actual and the forecasted readings. The models can produce a strong growth estimate for businesses and policymakers to plan more appropriately in the short term. Overall, the GARCH-LSTM model produced the least RMSE which also shows that complex models tend to perform better than simpler models</description>

      <title>Green vehicle routing problem that jointly optimizes delivery speed and routing based on the characteristics of electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance of materials and the development of the economy have led to the flourishing of the logistics industry, but have also caused certain pollution. The research on GVRP (Green vehicle routing problem) for planning vehicle routes during transportation to reduce pollution is also increasingly developing. Further exploration is needed on how to integrate these research findings with real vehicles. This paper establishes an energy consumption model using real electric vehicles, fully considering the physical characteristics of each component of the vehicle. To avoid the distortion of energy consumption models affecting the results of route planning. The energy consumption model also incorporates the effects of vehicle start/stop, speed, distance, and load on energy consumption. In addition, a load first speed optimization algorithm was proposed, which selects the most suitable speed between every two delivery points while planning the route. In order to further reduce energy consumption while meeting the time window. Finally, an improved Adaptive Genetic Algorithm is used to solve for the most energy-efficient route. The experiment shows that the results of using this speed optimization algorithm are generally more energy-efficient than those without using this algorithm. The average energy consumption of constant speed delivery at different speeds is 17.16% higher than that after speed optimization. Provided a method that is closer to reality and easier for logistics companies to use. It also enriches the GVRP model.</description>

      <title>SYNOSIS: Image synthesis pipeline for machine vision in metal surface inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) methods for development of robust and flexible visual inspection system has shown promising. However their performance is highly dependent on the amount and diversity of training data. This is often restricted not only due to costs but also due to a wide variety of defects and product surfaces which occur with varying frequency. As such, one can not guarantee that the acquired dataset contains enough defect and product surface occurrences which are needed to develop a robust model. Using parametric synthetic dataset generation, it is possible to avoid these issues. In this work, we introduce a complete pipeline which describes in detail how to approach image synthesis for surface inspection - from first acquisition, to texture and defect modeling, data generation, comparison to real data and finally use of the synthetic data to train a defect segmentation model. The pipeline is in detail evaluated for milled and sandblasted aluminum surfaces. In addition to providing an in-depth view into each step, discussion of chosen methods, and presentation of ML results, we provide a comprehensive dual dataset containing both real and synthetic images.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforced Trader (HRT): A Bi-Level Approach for Optimizing Stock Selection and Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in automated stock trading has shown promising results, yet its application faces significant challenges, including the curse of dimensionality, inertia in trading actions, and insufficient portfolio diversification. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Hierarchical Reinforced Trader (HRT), a novel trading strategy employing a bi-level Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework. The HRT integrates a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based High-Level Controller (HLC) for strategic stock selection with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based Low-Level Controller (LLC) tasked with optimizing trade executions to enhance portfolio value. In our empirical analysis, comparing the HRT agent with standalone DRL models and the S&amp;P 500 benchmark during both bullish and bearish market conditions, we achieve a positive and higher Sharpe ratio. This advancement not only underscores the efficacy of incorporating hierarchical structures into DRL strategies but also mitigates the aforementioned challenges, paving the way for designing more profitable and robust trading algorithms in complex markets.</description>

      <title>Feature Mapping in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the training dynamics of PINNs with a feature mapping layer via the limiting Conjugate Kernel and Neural Tangent Kernel is investigated, shedding light on the convergence of PINNs; Although the commonly used Fourier-based feature mapping has achieved great success, we show its inadequacy in some physics scenarios. Via these two scopes, we propose conditionally positive definite Radial Basis Function as a better alternative. Lastly, we explore the feature mapping numerically in wide neural networks. Our empirical results reveal the efficacy of our method in diverse forward and inverse problem sets. Composing feature functions is found to be a practical way to address the expressivity and generalisability trade-off, viz., tuning the bandwidth of the kernels and the surjectivity of the feature mapping function. This simple technique can be implemented for coordinate inputs and benefits the broader PINNs research.</description>

      <title>Numerical optimal control for delay differential equations: A simultaneous approach based on linearization of the delayed state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time delays are ubiquitous in industry, and they must be accounted for when designing control strategies. However, numerical optimal control (NOC) of delay differential equations (DDEs) is challenging because it requires specialized discretization methods and the time delays may depend on the manipulated inputs or state variables. Therefore, in this work, we propose to linearize the delayed states around the current time. This results in a set of implicit differential equations, and we compare the steady states and the corresponding stability criteria of the DDEs and the approximate system. Furthermore, we propose a simultaneous approach for NOC of DDEs based on the linearization, and we discretize the approximate system using Euler's implicit method. Finally, we present a numerical example involving a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>AT-MoE: Adaptive Task-planning Mixture of Experts via LoRA Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence, with the potential to transform various sectors through automation and insightful analysis. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has been proposed as a solution to enhance model performance in complex tasks. Yet, existing MoE models struggle with task-specific learning and interpretability, especially in fields like medicine where precision is critical. This paper introduces the Adaptive Task-planing Mixture of Experts(AT-MoE), an innovative architecture designed to address these limitations. We first train task-specific experts via LoRA approach to enhance problem-solving capabilities and interpretability in specialized areas. Subsequently, we introduce a layer-wise adaptive grouped routing module that optimizes module fusion based on complex task instructions, ensuring optimal task resolution. The grouped routing module first perform overall weight allocation from the dimension of the expert group, and then conduct local weight normalization adjustments within the group. This design maintains multi-dimensional balance, controllability, and interpretability, while facilitating task-specific fusion in response to complex instructions.</description>

      <title>BRC20 Pinning Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BRC20 tokens are a type of non-fungible asset on the Bitcoin network. They allow users to embed customized content within Bitcoin satoshis. The related token frenzy has reached a market size of US$2,650b over the past year (2023Q3-2024Q3). However, this intuitive design has not undergone serious security scrutiny.
  We present the first in-depth analysis of the BRC20 transfer mechanism and identify a critical attack vector. A typical BRC20 transfer involves two bundled on-chain transactions with different fee levels: the first (i.e., Tx1) with a lower fee inscribes the transfer request, while the second (i.e., Tx2) with a higher fee finalizes the actual transfer. We find that an adversary can exploit this by sending a manipulated fee transaction (falling between the two fee levels), which allows Tx1 to be processed while Tx2 remains pinned in the mempool. This locks the BRC20 liquidity and disrupts normal transfers for users. We term this BRC20 pinning attack.
  Our attack exposes an inherent design flaw that can be applied to 90+% inscription-based tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
  We also conducted the attack on Binance's ORDI hot wallet (the most prevalent BRC20 token and the most active wallet), resulting in a temporary suspension of ORDI withdrawals on Binance for 3.5 hours, which were shortly resumed after our communication.</description>
