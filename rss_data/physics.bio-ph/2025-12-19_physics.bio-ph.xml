      <title>Predicting the Interfacial Energy and Morphology of DNA Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics and morphology of biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation underpin diverse biological processes, exemplified by the nested organization of nucleoli that facilitates ribosome biogenesis. Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict multiphase morphologies in DNA-nanostar solutions. Because morphology is governed by interfacial energies between coexisting phases, we combine Flory-Huggins theory with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how these energies depend on key microscopic features of DNA nanostars, including size, valence, bending rigidity, Debye screening length, binding strength, and sticky-end distribution. The phase behavior of DNA nanostars is quantitatively captured by a generalized lattice model, in which the interplay between sticky-end binding energy and conformational entropy determines the effective interactions. Focusing on condensates comprising two dense phases, we find that Janus-like morphologies are ubiquitous because the interfacial energies between the dense and dilute phases, $\gamma_{i\in\{1,2\}}$, are typically comparable. In contrast, nested morphologies are rare as they require a large asymmetry in $\gamma_i$, which arises only for highly dissimilar nanostars such as those differing markedly in valence or size. Moreover, the interfacial energy between the two dense phases, $\gamma_{12}$, can be modulated either discretely, by varying sticky-end distribution, or continuously, by tuning the crosslinker ratio; the former may even eliminate nested configurations. These findings establish physical design principles for constructing complex condensate architectures directly from microscopic molecular parameters.</description>

      <title>Explosive dispersal of non-motile microbes through metabolic buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-motile microorganisms, spatial expansion in quiescent fluids is presumed to be limited by diffusion. We report that microbial colonies can explosively circumvent this constraint through a self-amplifying physical process. As non-motile yeast and bacteria metabolize dense nutrients into lighter waste within their fluid environment, they generate buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, an ubiquitous fluid-dynamical phenomenon that organizes material on scales from chemical reactors to planetary atmospheres. This robust, self-generated flow fragments and disperses cellular aggregates, which seed new growth sites, enhancing total metabolic activity and further strengthening the convective flow in an autocatalytic cycle. The resulting expansion follows accelerating power-law kinetics, quantitatively captured by a physical theory linking metabolic flux to flow velocity, and produces fractal patterns through a flow-focusing instability we term Circulation-Driven Aggregation, the hydrodynamic analogue of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. This `metabolic fireworks' mechanism establishes a canonical instance of proliferating active matter, where cellular metabolic activity self-organizes a physical transport engine--a living Rayleigh-B\'enard convection--providing a fundamental, physics-based dispersal strategy.</description>

      <title>Back with Weight: Revisiting Very Heavy Ions for Precision Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerated charged particles offer significant physical advantages over X-rays in radiotherapy. In addition to their superior depth-dose distribution, heavy ions provide notable biological benefits compared to protons. Specifically, at therapeutic energies, very heavy ions are expected to exhibit high relative biological effectiveness and a low oxygen enhancement ratio, making them potentially ideal for treating radioresistant tumors. Over fifty years ago, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory started a clinical trial to treat cancer patients with particles ranging from helium to argon. However, treatments with ions of atomic number greater than 10 proved highly toxic to normal tissue. Most patients were ultimately treated with helium ions, whose biological effects closely resemble those of protons. In recent years, novel strategies have emerged that can reduce normal tissue toxicity in radiotherapy while preserving tumor control. These advancements open the possibility of revisiting the clinical use of heavier ions. In this paper, we propose that neon ions may serve as an effective modality for treating resistant, hypoxic tumors. Their associated toxicity may be mitigated by employing approaches such as ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) or spatially fractionated radiotherapy. Current plans and prospects for the clinical application of neon ions will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Cell divisions both challenge and refine tissue boundaries in the Drosophila embryo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tissue boundaries pattern embryos, suppress tumours, and provide directional cues. Tissue boundaries are associated with supracellular cables formed by actin and the molecular motor non-muscle myosin II. Actomyosin cables generate tension that prevents cell mixing. Whether other cellular behaviours contribute to the formation of linear interfaces between cell populations remains unclear. In the Drosophila embryo, an actomyosin-based boundary separates the ectoderm from the mesectoderm, a group of neuronal and glial progenitors. Mathematical modelling predicted that cell divisions in the ectoderm challenge the mesectoderm-ectoderm (ME) boundary. Consistent with this, suppressing ectoderm cell divisions in vivo prevented cell mixing across the ME boundary when actomyosin-based tension was lost. Our mathematical model also predicted that cell divisions sharpen the ME boundary by reducing tension and increasing cell motility in the ectoderm. We found that inhibiting ectoderm divisions in vivo reduced boundary linearity. Using laser ablation and cell tracking, we demonstrated that cell divisions reduced junctional tension and increased cell movement in the ectoderm. Together, our results reveal that cell divisions facilitate cellular rearrangements to increase fluidity in a novel mechanism for boundary refinement.</description>
