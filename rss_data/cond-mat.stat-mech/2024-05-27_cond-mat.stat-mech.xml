      <title>Critical exponents of correlated percolation of sites not visited by a random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a $d$-dimensional correlated percolation problem of sites {\em not} visited by a random walk on a hypercubic lattice $L^d$ for $d=3$, 4 and 5. The length of the random walk is ${\cal N}=uL^d$. Close to the critical value $u=u_c$, many geometrical properties of the problem can be described as powers (critical exponents) of $u_c-u$, such as $\beta$, which controls the strength of the spanning cluster, and $\gamma$, which characterizes the behavior of the mean finite cluster size $S$. We show that at $u_c$ the ratio between the mean mass of the largest cluster $M_1$ and the mass of the second largest cluster $M_2$ is independent of $L$ and can be used to find $u_c$. We calculate $\beta$ from the $L$-dependence of $M_2$ and $\gamma$ from the finite size scaling of $S$. The resulting exponent $\beta$ remains close to 1 in all dimensions. The exponent $\gamma$ decreases from $\approx 3.9$ in $d=3$ to $\approx1.9$ in $d=4$ and $\approx 1.3$ in $d=5$ towards $\gamma=1$ expected in $d=6$, which is close to $\gamma=4/(d-2)$.</description>

      <title>Input-driven circuit reconfiguration in critical recurrent neural networks.Marcelo O. Magnasco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing a circuit dynamically, without actually changing the hardware itself, is called reconfiguration, and is of great importance due to its manifold technological applications. Circuit reconfiguration appears to be a feature of the cerebral cortex, and hence understanding the neuroarchitectural and dynamical features underlying self-reconfiguration may prove key to elucidate brain function. We present a very simple single-layer recurrent network, whose signal pathways can be reconfigured "on the fly" using only its inputs, with no changes to its synaptic weights. We use the low spatio-temporal frequencies of the input to landscape the ongoing activity, which in turn permits or denies the propagation of traveling waves. This mechanism uses the inherent properties of dynamically-critical systems, which we guarantee through unitary convolution kernels. We show this network solves the classical connectedness problem, by allowing signal propagation only along the regions to be evaluated for connectedness and forbidding it elsewhere.</description>

      <title>In-Depth Investigation of Phase Transition Phenomena in Network Models Derived from Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice models exhibit significant potential in investigating phase transitions, yet they encounter numerous computational challenges. To address these issues, this study introduces a Monte Carlo-based approach that transforms lattice models into a network model with intricate inter-node correlations. This framework enables a profound analysis of Ising, JQ, and XY models. By decomposing the network into a maximum entropy and a conservative component, under the constraint of detailed balance, this work derive an estimation formula for the temperature-dependent magnetic induction in Ising models. Notably, the critical exponent $\beta$ in the Ising model aligns well with established results, and the predicted phase transition point in the three-dimensional Ising model exhibits a mere $0.7 \%$ deviation from numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fitness noise in the Bak-Sneppen evolution model in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Bak-Sneppen evolution model on a regular hypercubic lattice in high dimensions. Recent work [Phys. Rev. E 108, 044109 (2023)] has shown the emergence of the $1/f^{\alpha}$ noise for the ``fitness'' observable with $\alpha \approx 1.2$ in one-dimension (1D) and $\alpha \approx 2$ for the random neighbor (mean-field) version of the model. We examine the temporal correlation of fitness in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions. As obtained by finite-size scaling, the spectral exponent tends to take the mean-field value at the upper critical dimension ${\rm D}_u = 4$, which is consistent with previous studies. Our approach provides an alternative way to understand the upper critical dimension of the model. We also show the local activity power spectra, which offer insight into return time statistics and the avalanche dimension.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a model for hyperthermia therapies based on heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing a topological defect. Biological tissues behave like active liquid crystals with the presence of topological defects which are likely to anchor tumors during the metastatic phase of cancer evolution and the therapy challenge is to destroy the cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissues. The defect creates an effective non-Euclidean geometry for low-energy excitations, modifying the bio-heat equation. Applications to protocols of thermal ablation for various biological tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) is analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off Relations in Quantum Measurements and Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical measurements, it is widely recognized that reducing the measurement time leads to decreased accuracy. On the other hand, whether an inherent speed-accuracy trade-off exists as a fundamental physical constraint for quantum measurements is not obvious, and the answer remains unknown. Here, we establish a fundamental speed-accuracy trade-off relation as a consequence of the energy conservation law and the locality. Our trade-off works as a no-go theorem that the zero-error measurement for the operators that are non-commutative with the Hamiltonian cannot be implemented with finite time and applies universally to various existing errors and disturbances defined for quantum measurements. We furthermore apply our methods to quantum computations and provide another speed-accuracy trade-off relation for unitary gate implementations, which works as another no-go theorem that any error-less implementations of quantum computation gates changing energy cannot be implemented with finite time, and a speed-disturbance trade-off for general quantum operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the stochastic thermodynamics of Fisher information (FI), meaning we characterize both the \textit{fluctuations} of FI, introducing a parastatistics of that quantity, and thermodynamic quantities. We introduce two initial conditions: an equilibrium initial condition and a minimum entropy initial condition, both under a protocol that drives the system to equilibrium. Its results indicate a dependence of the average FI on both the initial condition and path taken. Furthermore, the results point the chosen parameter directly affects the FI of thermodynamic quantities such as irreversible work and entropy, along with fluctuations of a stochastic FI. Last, we assess the further role of FI of the distribution of thermal quantities within the context of thermostatistical inequalities.</description>

      <title>Subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for translation invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00410v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for translation invariant quantum spin systems has been proved recently by using random matrices. In this paper, we study the subsystem version of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for translation invariant quantum systems without referring to random matrices. We first find a relation between the quantum variance and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. Then, by showing the small upper bounds on the quantum variance and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy, we prove the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for translation invariant quantum systems with an algebraic speed of convergence in an elementary way. The proof holds for most of the translation invariant quantum lattice models with exponential or algebraic decays of correlations.</description>

      <title>Slow measurement-only dynamics of entanglement in Pauli subsystem codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-unitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy which scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits for which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our work is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes whose subsystem symmetries are nonlocally {\it generated}, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation in long-range interacting super-Tonks-Girardeau systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate the system when the interactions are suddenly switched from the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) to the super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) limit. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the sTG gas exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the nonthermal (quantum) gas and the thermal (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce some intermediate quasi-prethermal states. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Synchronization-Induced Patterns in Two-dimensional Magnetic Rod Systems under Rotating Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two-dimensional assemblies of rod-shaped magnetic colloids under the influence of an external rotating magnetic field. Using Molecular Dynamics, we simulate the formation of patterns that emerge based on the synchronization degree between the magnetic rods and the rotating field. We then explore the structural and dynamic characteristics of the resulting steady states, examining their evolution as a function of changes in the rods' aspect ratio, the strength of the external magnetic field, and its rotation frequency. Three distinct synchronization regimes of the rods with the magnetic field are clearly observed. A detailed set of phase diagrams illustrates the complex relationship between the magnitude of the external magnetic field and its rotation frequency and how these parameters govern the formation of unique self-organized structures.</description>

      <title>Procedural Construction of Atomistic Polyurethane Block Copolymer Models for High Throughput Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, methods are presented to automatically generate a fully atomistic LAMMPS models of arbitrary linear multiblock polyurethane copolymers. The routine detailed here receives as parameters the number of repeat units per hard block, the number of units in a soft block, and the number of soft blocks per chain, as well as chemical formulae of three monomers which will form the hard component, soft component, and chain extender. A routine is detailed for converting the chemical structure of a free monomer to the urethane bonded repeat units in a polymer. The python package RadonPy is leveraged to assemble these units into blocks, and the blocks into copolymers. Care is taken in this work to ensure that plausible atomic charges are assigned to repeat units in different parts of the chain. The static structure factor is calculated for a variety of chemistries, and the results compared with wide angle x-ray scattering data from experiments with corresponding composition. The generated models reproduce the amorphous halo observed in the scattering data as well as some of the finer details. Structure factor calculations are decomposed into the partial structure factors to interrogate the structural properties of the two block types separately. Parametric surveys are carried out of the effects of various parameters, including temperature, soft block length, and block connectivity on the observed structure. The routine detailed here for constructing models is robust enough to be executed automatically in a high throughput workflow for material design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate training and sampling of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to their simple architecture, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting interpretable insights from data. However, training RBMs, as other energy-based models, on highly structured data poses a major challenge, as effective training relies on mixing the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations used to estimate the gradient. This process is often hindered by multiple second-order phase transitions and the associated critical slowdown. In this paper, we present an innovative method in which the principal directions of the dataset are integrated into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization procedure. This approach enables efficient sampling of the equilibrium measure via a static Monte Carlo process. By starting the standard training process with a model that already accurately represents the main modes of the data, we bypass the initial phase transitions. Our results show that this strategy successfully trains RBMs to capture the full diversity of data in datasets where previous methods fail. Furthermore, we use the training trajectories to propose a new sampling method, {\em parallel trajectory tempering}, which allows us to sample the equilibrium measure of the trained model much faster than previous optimized MCMC approaches and a better estimation of the log-likelihood. We illustrate the success of the training method on several highly structured datasets.</description>

      <title>Super-diffusive transport in two-dimensional Fermionic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional model of a Fermionic wire in contact with reservoirs along its two opposite edges. With the reservoirs biased around a Fermi level, $E$, we study the scaling of the conductance of the wire with its length, $L$ as the width of the wire $W\rightarrow\infty$. The wire is disordered along the direction of the transport so the conductance is expected to exponentially decay with the length of the wire. However, we show that our model shows a super-diffusive scaling ($1/L^{1/2}$) of the conductance within $|E|&lt;E_c$. This behavior is attributed to the presence of eigenstates of diverging localization length as $W\rightarrow\infty$. At $|E|=E_c$, the conductance behavior is sensitive to the disorder and scales sub-diffusively as $1/L^{3/2}$, and $1/L^{5/2}$ for zero and nonzero expectation value of the disorder. Furthermore, at this Fermi level and at certain points in the parameter space of the wire, the behavior of the conductance is also sensitive to the sign of the expectation value of the disorder. At these points we find $1/L^{7/4}$ for zero expectation value of the disorder and $1/L$, $1/L^{3}$ for different signs of the expectation value of the disorder.</description>

Abstract: In the past years, the amount of research on active matter has grown extremely rapidly, a fact that is reflected in particular by the existence of more than 600 review articles on this topic. Moreover, the field has become very diverse, ranging from theoretical studies of the statistical mechanics of active particles to applied work on medical applications of microrobots and from biological systems to artificial swimmers. This makes it very difficult to get an overview over the field as a whole. Here, we provide such an overview in the form of a metareview article that surveys the existing review articles on active matter. Thereby, this article provides an introduction to the various subdisciplines of active matter science and constitutes a useful starting point for finding literature about a specific topic.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity permits edge states and strong localization in stochastic topological phases</title>

Abstract: Topological phases exhibit edge responses that are robust against deformations and defects. Such phases have recently been realized in stochastic systems, which model a large class of biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for these systems, such as the relation between the bulk topological invariant and observed edge responses, i.e. the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We show that contrary to established topological phases, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions to have edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. For both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states, we demonstrate that stochastic edge responses grow dramatically with non-reciprocity while the quantum version plateaus. Having established the necessity and importance of non-reciprocity for stochastic edge states, we point out fundamental theoretical and physical consequences of this result. Lastly, we present a novel mechanism by which non-reciprocity engenders robust edge currents in stochastic systems. Our work establishes the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions in permitting robust responses in active and living matter.</description>

      <title>Tracer diffusion beyond Gaussian behavior: explicit results for general single-file systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-file systems, in which particles diffuse in narrow channels while not overtaking each other, is a fundamental model for the tracer subdiffusion observed in confined geometries, such as in zeolites or carbon nanotubes. Twenty years ago, the mean squared displacement of a tracer was determined at large times, for any diffusive single-file system. Since then, for a general single-file system, even the determination of the fourth cumulant, which probes the deviation from Gaussianity, has remained an open question. Here, we fill this gap and provide an explicit formula for the fourth cumulant of an arbitrary single-file system. Our approach also allows us to quantify the perturbation induced by the tracer on its environment, encoded in the correlation profiles. These explicit results constitute a first step towards obtaining a closed equation for the correlation profiles for arbitrary single-file systems.</description>

      <title>Non-compact quantum spin chains as integrable stochastic particle processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.01048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a family of models of particle and energy diffusion on a one-dimensional lattice, related to those studied previously in [Sasamoto-Wadati], [Barraquand-Corwin] and [Povolotsky] in the context of KPZ universality class. We show that they may be mapped onto an integrable $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ Heisenberg spin chain whose Hamiltonian density in the bulk has been already studied in the AdS/CFT and the integrable system literature. Using the quantum inverse scattering method, we study various new aspects, in particular we identify boundary terms, modeling reservoirs in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics models, for which the spin chain (and thus also the stochastic process) continues to be integrable. We also show how the construction of a "dual model" of probability theory is possible and useful. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of our stochastic model corresponds to the semiclassical evolution of a string that derives from correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM), in imaginary-time. As any stochastic system, it has a supersymmetric completion that encodes for the thermal equilibrium theorems: we show that in this case it is equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ superstring that has been derived directly from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of an integrable non-equilibrium particle system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.01720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the integrable family of symmetric boundary-driven interacting particle systems that arise from the non-compact XXX Heisenberg model in one dimension with open boundaries. In contrast to the well-known symmetric exclusion process, the number of particles at each site is unbounded. We show that a finite chain of $N$ sites connected at its ends to two reservoirs can be solved exactly, i.e. the factorial moments of the non-equilibrium steady-state can be written in closed form for each $N$. The solution relies on probabilistic arguments and techniques inspired by integrable systems. It is obtained in two steps: i) the introduction of a dual absorbing process reducing the problem to a finite number of particles; ii) the solution of the dual dynamics exploiting a symmetry obtained from the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. Long-range correlations are computed in the finite-volume system. The exact solution allows to prove by a direct computation that, in the thermodynamic limit, the system approaches local equilibrium. A by-product of the solution is the algebraic construction of a direct mapping between the non-equilibrium steady state and the equilibrium reversible measure.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally Slow, Long Range, and Non-Gaussian Critical Fluctuations Dominate the Charge Density Wave Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $(TaSe_4)_2I$ is a well-studied quasi-one-dimensional compound long-known to have a charge-density wave (CDW) transition around 263 K. We argue that the critical fluctuations of the pinned CDW order parameter near the transition can be inferred from the resistance noise on account of their coupling to the dissipative normal carriers. Remarkably, the critical fluctuations of the CDW order parameter are slow enough to survive the thermodynamic limit and dominate the low-frequency resistance noise. The noise variance and relaxation time show rapid growth (critical opalescence and critical slowing down) within a temperature window of $ \varepsilon \approx \pm 0.1$, where $\varepsilon$ is the reduced temperature. This is very wide but consistent with the Ginzburg criterion. We further show that this resistance noise can be quantitatively used to extract the associated critical exponents. Below $|\varepsilon | \lesssim 0.02$, we observe a crossover from mean-field to a fluctuation-dominated regime with the critical exponents taking anomalously low values. The distribution of fluctuations in the critical transition region is skewed and strongly non-Gaussian. This non-Gaussianity is interpreted as the breakdown of the validity of the central limit theorem as the diverging coherence volume becomes comparable to the macroscopic sample size. The large magnitude critical fluctuations observed over an extended temperature range, as well as the crossover from the mean-field to the fluctuation-dominated regime highlight the role of the quasi-one dimensional character in controlling the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviours of non-stabilizerness in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness - commonly known as magic - measures the extent to which a quantum state deviates from stabilizer states and is a fundamental resource for achieving universal quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-stabilizerness around criticality in quantum spin chains. To quantify non-stabilizerness, we employ a monotone called mana, based on the negativity of the discrete Wigner function. This measure captures non-stabilizerness for both pure and mixed states. We introduce R\'enyi generalizations of mana, which are also measures of non-stabilizerness for pure states, and utilize it to compute mana in large quantum systems. We consider the three-state Potts model and its non-integrable extension and we provide strong evidence that the mutual mana exhibits universal logarithmic scaling with distance in conformal field theory, as is the case for entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of the $\text{SO}(2N)$ symmetry in the Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical Gross-Neveu model for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions suffers a continuous phase transition at a critical interaction $g_{c1} \sim 1/N$ at large $N$, at which its continuous symmetry $\text{SO}(2N)$ is preserved and a discrete (Ising) symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. A recent mean-field calculation, however, points to an additional transition at a different critical $g_{c2}\sim -N g_{c1}$, at which $\text{SO}(2N) \rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$. To study the latter phase transition we rewrite the Gross-Neveu interaction $g (\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ in terms of three different quartic terms for the single ($L=1$) $4N$-component real (Majorana) fermion, and then extend the theory to $L&gt;1$. This allows us to track the evolution of the fixed points of the renormalization group transformation starting from $L\gg 1$, where one can discern three distinct critical points which correspond to continuous phase transitions into (1) $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet mass-order-parameter, (2) $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor mass-order-parameters, and (3) $\text{SO}(2N)$-adjoint nematic-order-parameters, down to $L=1$ value that is relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Below the critical value of $L_c (N)\approx 0.35 N$ for $N\gg1$ only the Gross-Neveu critical point (1) still implies a diverging susceptibility for its corresponding ($\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet) order parameter, whereas the two new critical points that existed at large $L$ ultimately become equivalent to the Gaussian fixed point at $L=1$. We interpret this metamorphosis of the $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor fixed point from critical to spurious as an indication that the transition at $g_{c2}$ in the original Gross-Neveu model is turned first-order by fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic correlation functions in 2D critical percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the large-scale geometric properties of two-dimensional critical percolation are described by a logarithmic conformal field theory, but it has been challenging to exhibit concrete examples of logarithmic singularities and to find an explanation and a physical interpretation, in terms of lattice observables, for their appearance. We show that certain percolation correlation functions receive independent contributions from a large number of similar connectivity events happening at different scales. Combined with scale invariance, this leads to logarithmic divergences. We study several logarithmic correlation functions for critical percolation in the bulk and in the presence of a boundary, including the four-point function of the density (spin) field. Our analysis confirms previous findings, provides new explicit calculations and explains, in terms of lattice observables, the physical mechanism that leads to the logarithmic singularities we discover. Although we adopt conformal field theory (CFT) terminology to present our results, the core of our analysis relies on probabilistic arguments and recent rigorous results on the scaling limit of critical percolation and does not assume a priori the existence of a percolation CFT. As a consequence, our results provide strong support for the validity of a CFT description of critical percolation and a step in the direction of a mathematically rigorous formulation of a logarithmic CFT of two-dimensional critical percolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of atomic simulations of materials and molecules can rapidly deteriorate when large free energy barriers exist between local minima. We propose smooth basin classification, a universal method to define reaction coordinates based on the internal feature representation of a graph neural network. We achieve high data efficiency by exploiting their built-in symmetry and adopting a transfer learning strategy. We benchmark our approach on challenging chemical and physical transformations, and show that it matches and even outperforms reaction coordinates defined based on human intuition.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Generating-functional analysis of random Lotka-Volterra systems: A step-by-step guide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides what is hopefully a self-contained set of notes describing the detailed steps of a generating-functional analysis of systems of generalised Lotka-Volterra equations with random interaction coefficients. Nothing in these notes is original, instead the generating-functional method (also known as the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominic-Janssen formalism) and the resulting dynamic mean field theories have been used for the study of disordered systems and spin glasses for decades. But it is hard to find unifying sources which would allow a beginner to learn step-by-step how these methods can be used. My aim is to provide such a source. Most of the calculations are specific to generalised Lotka-Volterra systems, but much can be transferred to disordered systems in more general.</description>
