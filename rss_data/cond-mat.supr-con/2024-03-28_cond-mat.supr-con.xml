      <title>Strong-coupling approach to temperature dependence of competing orders of superconductivity: Possible time-reversal symmetry breaking and nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to study the competition of separate superconducting orders at low temperatures. Specifically, we study magnon-mediated superconductivity in a trilayer heterostructure with a thin normal metal between two antiferromagnetic insulators. Spin-triplet $p$-wave, spin-triplet $f$-wave, and spin-singlet $d$-wave superconducting gaps have been predicted to occur close to the critical temperature for the superconducting instability. The gap symmetry with the largest critical temperature depends on parameters in the model. We confirm that the same gap symmetries appear at any temperature below the critical temperature. Furthermore, we show that the temperature can affect the competition between the different superconducting orders. In addition, we consider time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, complex linear combinations of candidate pairings, such as chiral $p$-, $f$-, and $d$-wave gaps, as well as $p_x+if_y$-wave gaps. We find indications that some of these time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, nodeless gaps offer a greater condensation energy than the time-reversal symmetric gaps. This indicates that superconducting states with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and nontrivial topology may be preferred in this system.</description>

      <title>Single-Crystal Growth and Characterization of Cuprate Superconductor (Hg,Re)Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+{\delta}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We grew (Hg,Re)Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+{\delta} ((Hg,Re)1223) single crystals with good reproducibility via the single-step flux method using monoxides as raw materials. A double-sealing method using a thick-walled quartz tube and a stainless-steel container was adopted for explosion protection. The maximum crystal size was approximately 1 mm x 1 mm in the ab plane and 0.04 mm in thickness. The crystal was square-shaped, reflecting the tetragonal crystal structure of (Hg,Re)1223. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated a critical temperature of 130 K. The in-plane resistivity exhibited a linear temperature dependence, indicating that the sample was close to optimal doping level. The out-of-plane resistivity was also measured, and the anisotropy parameter was 250-650 at 300 K.</description>

      <title>Normal Fermi Surface in the Nodal Superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ Revealed via Thermal Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ was measured with a magnetic field rotating in the tetragonal a-b plane, with the heat current in the anti-nodal direction, $J$ || [100]. We observe a sharp resonance in thermal conductivity for the magnetic field at an angle $\theta$ $\sim$ 12$^{\circ}$, measured from the heat current direction [100]. This resonance corresponds to the reported resonance at an angle $\theta'$ $\sim$ 33$^{\circ}$ from the direction of the heat current applied along the nodal direction, $J$ || [110]. Both resonances, therefore, occur when the magnetic field is applied in the same crystallographic orientation in the two experiments, regardless of the direction of the heat current, proving conclusively that these resonances are due to the structure of the Fermi surface of CeCoIn$_5$. We argue that the uncondensed Landau quasiparticles, emerging with field, are responsible for the observed resonance. We support our experimental results with density-functional-theory model calculations of the density of states in a rotating magnetic field. Our calculations, using a model Fermi surface of CeCoIn$_5$, reveal several sharp peaks as a function of the field direction. Our study demonstrates that the thermal-conductivity measurement in rotating magnetic field can probe the normal parts of the Fermi surface deep inside the superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Long-range Phase Coherence and Tunable Second Order ${\phi}_0$-Josephson Effect in a Dirac Semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential applications in superconducting logic circuits. Several mechanisms such as magneto-chiral effects, finite momentum Cooper pairing, asymmetric edge currents have been proposed to give rise to a supercurrent diode effect in different materials. In this work, we establish the presence of a large intrinsic Josephson diode effect in a type-II Dirac semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$ facilitated by its helical spin-momentum locking and distinguish it from other extrinsic effects. The magnitude of the Josephson diode effect is shown to be directly correlated to the large second-harmonic component of the supercurrent that is induced by the significant contribution of the topological spin-momentum locked states that promote coherent Andreev processes in the junction. We denote such junctions, where the relative phase between the two harmonics corresponding to charge transfers of $2e$ and $4e$ can be tuned by a magnetic field, as second order ${\phi}_0$-junctions. The direct correspondence between the second harmonic supercurrent component and the diode effect in $1T-PtTe_2$ junctions makes topological semimetals with high transparency an ideal platform to study and implement the Josephson diode effect, while also enabling further research on higher order supercurrent transport in Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Selective Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has ignited stark interest within the scientific community, particularly regarding its likely unconventional origin. Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also provoke similarities to other pending candidate odd-parity superconductors.</description>

      <title>A generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi sea can host exotic quantum topology, which determines the conductance quantization in metals and is characterized by the Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Here, we propose a generic reduction theory for the Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be identified by the feature of reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. We also reveal a striking connection between the Fermi sea topology and the gapped band topology, in which $\chi_F$ exactly equals to the topological invariant of the gapped topological phases by using an ingenious mapping. This nontrivial result provides a potential method to probe $\chi_F$ through $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological superconductors and further paves the way for studying the Fermi sea topology via the gapped topological systems. Our work promotes a deep understanding and simple detection for $\chi_F$, which shall facilitate the discovery of other novel physical effects caused by the Fermi sea topology in the future.</description>

      <title>An extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quark and nuclear matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to one capable of exploring quark and nuclear matter consistently. With an extra term standing for quark-nucleon interactions, nucleons could automatically emerge as color-singlet three-quark entities by following a process similar to mesons. Besides the quark part in mean field approximation, both mesons and nucleons could contribute to the thermodynamic potential thus possibly give rise to quarkyonic matter beyond mean field. In the study, two kinds of "confining" couplings are adopted for the new interaction term and two different quark masses are considered for comparison. It turns out that only confined nuclear matter or deconfined quark matter is possible for all the cases at zero temperature, thus quarkyonic matter is not favored at all. Even more strictly, only the case with stronger confinement effect and a smaller quark mass admits a physical first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter around twice saturation density.</description>

      <title>Dynamic interaction between chiral currents and surface waves in topological superfluids: a pathway to detect Majorana fermions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental efforts over the past two decades, the quest for Majorana fermions in superconductors remains inconclusive. We propose an experimental method that can conclusively confirm, or rule out, the existence of these quasiparticles: Firstly, we shift focus from superconductors, whose very topological nature is disputed, to the unambiguous topological superfluid $^3$He. Secondly, we identify the interaction between surface waves and the chiral Majorana current in the bulk of a topological superfluid of varying density. The proposed experiment provides a path towards the detection of the Majorana fermion, an 80-year-old theoretical prediction. It is realistically achievable based on the advent of microscopic superfluid resonators coupled to optical cavities. The proposal may open the door to experiments ranging from simulations of exotic cosmological particles to topological acoustics and fault tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Josephson Junction Reproducibility in 30 kV E-beam Lithography: Analysis of Backscattered Electron Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores methods to enhance the reproducibility of Josephson junctions, crucial elements in superconducting quantum technologies, when employing the Dolan technique in 30 kV e-beam processes. The study explores the influence of dose distribution along the bridge area on reproducibility, addressing challenges related to fabrication sensitivity. Experimental methods include E-beam lithography, with electron trajectory simulations shedding light on backscattered electron behavior. We demonstrate the fabrication of different junction geometries, revealing that some geometries significantly improve reproducibility by resulting in a more homogeneous dose distribution over the junction area.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity induced by spin-orbit coupling, perpendicular magnetic field and superlattice potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological superconductors support Majorana modes, which are quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles and which obey non-Abelian statistics in which successive exchanges of particles do not always commute. Here we investigate whether a two-dimensional superconductor with ordinary s-wave pairing can be rendered topological by the application of a strong magnetic field. To address this, we obtain the self-consistent solutions to the mean field Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are a large set of nonlinearly coupled equations, for electrons moving on a lattice. We find that the topological "quantum Hall superconductivity" is facilitated by a combination of spin-orbit coupling, which locks an electron's spin to its momentum as it moves through a material, and a coupling to an external periodic potential which gives a dispersion to the Landau levels and also distorts the Abrikosov lattice. We find that, for a range of parameters, the Landau levels broadened by the external periodic potential support topological superconductivity, which is typically accompanied by a lattice of "giant" $h/e$ vortices as opposed to the familiar lattice of $h/2e$ Abrikosov vortices. In the presence of a periodic potential, we find it necessary to use an ansatz for the pairing potential of the form $\Delta(\vec{r})e^{i2\vec{Q}\cdot\vec{r}}$ where $\Delta(\vec{r})$ has a periodicity commensurate with the periodic potential. However, despite this form of the pairing potential, the current in the ground state is zero. In the region of ordinary superconductivity, we typically find a lattice of dimers of $h/2e$ vortices. Our work suggests a realistic proposal for achieving topological superconductivity, as well as a helical order parameter and unusual Abrikosov lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport is attracting much attention as a novel probe and functionality of noncentrosymmetric superconductors. In this work, we show that both the longitudinal and transverse nonlinear paraconductivity are hugely enhanced in helical superconductors in moderate and high magnetic fields, which can be observed by second-harmonic resistance measurements. The discussion is based on the generalized formulation of nonlinear paraconductivity in combination with the microscopically determined Ginzburg-Landau coefficients. The enhanced nonreciprocal transport would be observable even with the cyclotron motion of fluctuating Cooper pairs, which is elucidated with a Kubo-type formula of nonlinear paraconductivity. Nonreciprocal charge transport in the fluctuation regime is thereby established as a promising probe of helical superconductivity regardless of the sample dimensionality. Implications on the other finite-momentum superconducting states are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibilities for spin-singlet superconductivity in newly discovered altermagnets. Investigating $d$-wave altermagnets, we show that finite-momentum superconductivity can easily emerge in altermagnets even though they have no net magnetization, when the superconducting order parameter also has $d$-wave symmetry with nodes coinciding with the altermagnet nodes. Additionally, we find a rich phase diagram when both altermagnetism and an external magnetic field are considered, including superconductivity appearing at high magnetic fields from a parent zero-field normal state.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction as an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner. Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$, thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems, drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way, the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater level of control, using atomtronics platforms.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance in two-band superconductors with an incipient quasi-flat band: Enhanced critical temperature evading particle-hole fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconductivity, a surge of interests in enhancing $T_{\rm c}$ is ever mounting, where a recent focus is toward multi-band superconductivity. In $T_{\rm c}$ enhancements specific to two-band cases, especially around the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover considered here, we have to be careful about how quantum fluctuations affect the many-body states, i.e., particle-hole fluctuations suppressing the pairing for attractive interactions. Here we explore how to circumvent the suppression by examining multichannel pairing interactions in two-band systems. With the Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB) formalism for particle-hole fluctuations in a continuous space, we look into the case of a deep dispersive band accompanied by an incipient heavy-mass (i.e., quasi-flat) band. We find that, while the GMB corrections usually suppress $T_{\rm c}$ significantly, this in fact competes with the enhanced pairing arising from the heavy band, with the trade-off leading to a peaked structure in $T_{\rm c}$ against the band-mass ratio when the heavy band is incipient. The system then plunges into a strong-coupling regime with the GMB screening vastly suppressed. This occurs prominently when the chemical potential approaches the bound state lurking just below the heavy band, which can be viewed as a Fano-Feshbach resonance, with its width governed by the pair-exchange interaction. The diagrammatic structure comprising particle-particle and particle-hole channels is heavily entangled, so that the emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance dominates all the channels, suggesting a universal feature in multiband superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: For seven decades by A-15 superconductors we meant metallic $A_3B$ alloys (where A is a transition metal, and B is groups IIIB and IVB element) discovered by Hardy and Hulm (Phys. Rev. 89, 884 (1953)). Nb3Ge exhibited the highest superconducting transition temperature, $T_c = 23 K$, among these alloys. One of these alloys, $Nb_3Sn$, is primary material in modern applied superconductivity. Recently Guo et al (arXiv:2307.13067) extended the family of superconductors where the metallic ions arranged in the beta tungsten (A-15) sublattice by observation of $T_{c,zero} = 81 K$ in $La_4H_{23}$ phase compressed at $P = 118 GPa$. Despite the $La_4H_{23}$ has much lower $T_c$ in comparison with near-room-temperature superconducting $LaH_{10}$ phase ($T_{c,zero} = 250 K$ at $P = 200 GPa$) discovered by Drozdov et al (Nature 569, 531 (2019)), the $La_4H_{23}$ holds the record high $T_c$ within A-15 family. Cross et al (Phys. Rev. B 109, L020503 (2024)) confirmed the high-temperature superconductivity in the compressed $La_4H_{23}$. In this paper, we analyzed available experimental data measured in $La_4H_{23}$ and found that this superconductor exhibits nanograined structure, 5.5 nm &lt; D &lt; 35 nm, low crystalline strain &lt; 0.003, high electron-phonon coupling constant, 1.5 &lt; $\lambda_{e-ph}$ &lt; 2.55, and moderate level of the nonadiabaticity $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$. We found that derived $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$ and $T_c/T_F$ values for the $La_4H_{23}$ phase are similar to the ones in cuprates, pnictides, and near-room-temperature superconductors $H_3S$ and $LaH_{10}$, which implies that the $La_4H_{23}$ phase falls to unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot.</description>

      <title>Engineering flat bands in twisted-bilayer graphene away from the magic angle with chiral optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05^{\circ}$, which are nevertheless very fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an interval of approximately $0.8^{\circ}&lt;\theta&lt;1.3^{\circ}$. As highlighted by a simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), induced by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. Additionally, TRSB suppresses the Berry curvature and induces a topological phase transition, with a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, towards a band structure with two isolated flat bands with Chern number equal to $0$. The efficiency of the cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in moir\'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.</description>

      <title>On-demand driven dissipation for cavity reset and cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a superconducting circuit device that provides active, on-demand, tunable dissipation on a target mode of the electromagnetic field. Our device is based on a tunable "dissipator" that can be made lossy when tuned into resonance with a broadband filter mode. When driven parametrically, this dissipator induces loss on any mode coupled to it with energy detuning equal to the drive frequency. We demonstrate the use of this device to reset a superconducting qubit's readout cavity after a measurement, removing photons with a characteristic rate above $50\ \mu\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that the dissipation can be driven constantly to simultaneously damp and cool the cavity, effectively eliminating thermal photon fluctuations as a relevant decoherence channel. Our results demonstrate the utility of our device as a modular tool for environmental engineering and entropy removal in circuit QED.</description>

      <title>"Quantum Geometric Nesting'' and Solvable Model Flat-Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "quantum geometric nesting'' (QGN) to characterize the idealized ordering tendencies of certain flat-band systems implicit in the geometric structure of the flat-band subspace. Perfect QGN implies the existence of an infinite class of local interactions that can be explicitly constructed and give rise to solvable ground states with various forms of possible fermion bi-linear order, including flavor ferromagnetism, density waves, and superconductivity. For the ideal Hamiltonians constructed in this way, we show that certain aspects of the low-energy spectrum can also be exactly computed including, in the superconducting case, the phase stiffness. Examples of perfect QGN include flat bands with certain symmetries (e.g. chiral or time-reversal), and non-symmetry-related cases exemplified with an engineered model for pair-density-wave. Extending this approach, we obtain exact superconducting ground states with nontrivial pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Strange metal in the doped Hubbard model via percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many strongly correlated systems, including high-temperature superconductors such as the cuprates, exhibit strange metallic behavior in certain parameter regimes characterized by anomalous transport properties that are irreconcilable with a Fermi-liquid-like description in terms of quasiparticles. The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical starting point to examine the properties of such systems and also exhibits non-Fermi-liquid behavior in simulations. Here we analytically study the two-dimensional hole-doped Hubbard model, first identifying a percolation transition that occurs in the low-energy sector at critical hole doping $p_c\sim 0.19$. We then use the critical properties near this transition to rewrite the Hubbard Hamiltonian in a way that motivates a large-$N$ model with strange metallic properties. In particular, we show that this model has the linear-in-$T$ resistivity and power-law optical conductivity $\sim |\omega|^{-2/3}$ observed in the strange metal regime of cuprates, suggesting potential relevance for describing this important class of materials.</description>
