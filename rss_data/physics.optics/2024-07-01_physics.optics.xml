      <title>Design and Simulation of Si-Photonic Nanowire-Waveguides with DEP Concentration Electrodes for Biosensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-based photonic biosensors, such as microring resonators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers, offer significant potential for the detection of analytes at low concentrations. To enhance response time and improve the limit of detection within practical time scales, dielectrophoresis (DEP) has been proposed as a viable solution. In this approach, two electrodes are placed in close proximity to the sensor surface. By applying an AC field, analytes are transported to the sensor surface due to the polarization of the solvent and the particles, effectively overcoming the diffusion barrier. In this communication, we explore various possibilities for realizing DEP electrodes for nanowire waveguides using commercially available photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology. Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations suggest that the most beneficial electrode configuration is a planar electrode geometry on the device layer combined with a second electrode pair on the metal 1 layer.</description>

      <title>Monolithic lithium niobate photonic chip for efficient terahertz-optic modulation and terahertz generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) frequency range, bridging the gap between microwave and infrared frequencies, presents unparalleled opportunities for advanced imaging, sensing, communications, and spectroscopy applications. Terahertz photonics, in analogy with microwave photonics, is a promising solution to address the critical challenges in THz technologies through optical methods. Despite its vast potential, key technical challenges remain in effectively interfacing THz signals with the optical domain, especially THz-optic modulation and optical generation of THz waves. Here, we address these challenges using a monolithic integrated photonic chip designed to support efficient bidirectional interaction between THz and optical waves. Leveraging the significant second-order optical nonlinearity and strong optical and THz confinement in a thin-film lithium niobate on quartz platform, the chip supports both efficient THz-optic modulation and continuous THz wave generation at up to 500 GHz. The THz-optic modulator features a radio frequency (RF) half-wave voltage of 8V at 500 GHz, representing more than an order of magnitude reduction in modulation power consumption from previous works. The measured continuous wave THz generation efficiency of 4.8*10-6 /W at 500 GHz also marks a tenfold improvement over existing tunable THz generation devices based on lithium niobate. We further leverage the coherent nature of the optical THz generation process and mature optical modulation techniques to realize high-speed electro-THz modulation at frequencies up to 35 GHz. The chip-scale THz-photonic platform paves the way for more compact, efficient, and cost-effective THz systems with potential applications in THz communications, remote sensing, and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>High Precision Microscale 3D Manufacturing of Ultra Low Expansion Glass by Femtosecond Selective Laser Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its exceptional dimensional stability in harsh thermal conditions and excellent mechanical and optical properties, Corning ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass is the material of choice in many high-demanding fields such as aerospace, astronomy, and advanced optics. This material has recently attracted renewed attention with the advent of femtosecond laser technology, with a particular focus on the interaction of ultrafast pulses and the material itself. Phenomena like the formation of self-assembled nanogratings and their thermal stability as well as the darkening of laser-affected zones have then been characterized. This paper presents how to exploit femtosecond selective laser etching (SLE) techniques to manufacture truly three-dimensional (3D) components. To demonstrate the micron-scale accuracy and repeatability of this process from the mm- to the cm-size range, various devices are designed and fabricated: fiber hole arrays with different hole densities, sizes, orientations, and shapes; and fiber V-groove arrays. Additionally, a mechanical flexural fiber mount is presented as an example of how multiple functionalities can be monolithically integrated into a single piece of glass through SLE technology. An example of a passive alignment substrate for optical components is also shown. SLE technique represents a new advancement in the field of microscale manufacturing, enabling the scalable production of custom-designed ULE glass structures with unprecedented precision and complexity, paving the way for the miniaturized integration of highly stable components.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interferometry-based metrology of magneto-optical properties at infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical properties of materials are utilized in numerous applications both in scientific research and industries. The novel properties of these materials can be further investigated by performing metrology in the infrared wavelength range, thereby enriching their potential applications. However, current infrared metrology techniques can be challenging and resource-intensive due to the unavailability of suitable components. To address these challenges, we propose and demonstrate a set of measurements based on nonlinear interferometry, which allows us investigating magneto-optical properties of materials at infrared wavelength range by performing optical detection at the visible range. For a proof-of-principle study, we measure the Verdet constant of a bismuth-iron-garnet, over a spectral bandwidth of 600 nm in the near-IR range.</description>

      <title>Transfer printing micro-assembly of silicon photonic crystal cavity arrays: beating the fabrication tolerance limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities (PhCCs) can confine optical fields in ultra-small volumes, enabling efficient light-matter interactions for quantum and non-linear optics, sensing and all-optical signal processing. The inherent nanometric tolerances of micro-fabrication platforms can induce cavity resonant wavelength shifts two-orders of magnitude larger than cavity linewidths, prohibiting fabrication of arrays of nominally identical devices. We address this device variability by fabricating PhCCs as releasable pixels that can be transferred from their native substrate to a receiver where ordered micro-assembly can overcome the inherent fabrication variance. We demonstrate the measurement, binning and transfer of 119 PhCCs in a single session, producing spatially ordered arrays of PhCCs, sorted by resonant wavelength. Furthermore, the rapid in-situ measurement of the devices enables measurements of the PhCCs dynamic response to the print process for the first time, showing plastic and elastic effects in the seconds to hours range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of random micro lens array (rMLA) breaks the periodicity of micro lens array (MLA), suppressing coherence in the homogenization process, thereby achieving better spot homogenization effects. Sol-gel rMLA exhibits strong adaptability and high laser tolerance, making it valuable for laser beam control applications. However, the cracking tendency during the drying process of sol-gel is a challenge. This paper successfully prepares sol-gel random micro lens arrays through nanoimprint lithography, thoroughly analyzing the cracking mechanism and resolving the cracking issue during the drying process of sol-gel. The manufactured sol-gel random micro lenses exhibit good surface profile accuracy, uniformity, and excellent light source shaping effects. The energy utilization efficiency of various types of rMLA is approximately 90%, with rectangular and hexagonal rMLAs achieving uniformity of light spots of over 80%.</description>

      <title>Topological ferroelectric chirality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality, an inherent property of most objects of the universe, is a dynamic research topic in material science, physics, chemistry, and biology. The fundamental appeal of this extensive study is supported by the technological quest to manufacture materials with configurable chiralities for emerging applications ranging from optoelectronics and photonics to pharmaceutics and medicine. Recent advances put forth ferroelectrics as a host of chiral topological states in the form of Bloch domain walls, skyrmions, merons, and Hopfions, offering thus a unique ground for making chirality switchable and tunable. Here we review current developments, milestones achieved, and future routes of chiral ferroelectric materials. We focus on insights into the topological origin of the chirality in the nanostructured ferroelectrics, bringing new controllable functionalities. We pay special attention to novel developments enabling tunability and manipulating the chiroptical response and enantioselectivity, leading to new applications in nano-optoelectronics, plasmonics, pharmaceutics, and bio-medical industries.</description>

      <title>Unveiling photon-photon coupling induced transparency and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the theoretical foundations of an analogous electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) which we are referring as coupling induced transparency (CIT) and absorption (CIA) respectively, along with an exploration of the transition between these phenomena. We provide a concise phenomenological description with analytical expressions for transmission spectra and dispersion elucidating how the interplay of coherent and dissipative interactions in a coupled system results in the emergence of level repulsion and attraction, corresponding to CIT and CIA, respectively. The model is validated through numerical simulations using a hybrid system comprising a split ring resonator (SRR) and electric inductive-capacitive (ELC) resonator in planar geometry. We analyse two cases while keeping ELC parameters constant; one involving a dynamic adjustment of the SRR size with a fixed split gap, and the other entailing a varying gap while maintaining a constant SRR size. Notably, in the first case, the dispersion profile of the transmission signal demonstrates level repulsion, while the second case results in level attraction, effectively showcasing CIT and CIA, respectively. These simulated findings not only align with the theoretical model but also underscore the versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we expand our model to a more general case, demonstrating that a controlled transition from CIT to CIA is achievable by manipulating the dissipation rate of individual modes within the hybrid system, leading to either coherent or dissipative interactions between the modes. The results provide a pathway for designing hybrid systems that can control the group velocity of light, offering potential applications in the fields of optical switching and quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Assisted Squeezed States of Light in All Fiber Form-Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light sources, featuring significant degrees of squeezing, flexible time-frequency attributes, and a compact salable form factor, serve as crucial building blocks in an expanding range of applications, spanning from quantum computing to quantum sensing and communications. In this study, we introduce and demonstrate a novel approach to generating squeezed light that exclusively employs standard telecommunication fiber-optic components. The technique leverages the entanglement properties of spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) to generate high squeezing with flexible time-frequency properties. Notably, a record squeezing of 7.5 \(\pm\)0.1 dB is measured within an all-fiber, all-guided-wave platform. The entanglement-assisted squeezing methodology empowers the attainment of squeezing for arbitrary time-frequency modes within the SFWM phase-matching bandwidth, extending beyond coherent laser modes, for the first time. In particular, we measured 5.1 dB and 1.1 dB squeezing on partially coherent and chaotic time-frequency modes that are defined by randomly modulated laser sources and filtered amplified spontaneous emission light, respectively.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Frequency Response Determined by Saddle Points in Non-Hermitian Crystal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian crystal systems under open boundary condition (OBC), it is generally believed that the OBC modes with frequencies containing positive imaginary parts, when excited by external driving, will experience exponential growth in population, thereby leading to instability. However, our work challenges this conventional understanding. In such a system, we find an anomalous response that grows exponentially with the frequency aligned with those of saddle points. The frequencies of these saddle points on the complex plane are below the maximum imaginary part of OBC spectrum, but they can lie within or beyond the OBC spectrum. We derive general formulas of excitation-response relationships and find that this anomalous response can occur because the excitation of OBC modes eventually evolve toward these saddle points at long times. Only when the frequencies of all these saddle points are below the real axis do the non-Hermitian crystal systems remain stable under periodic excitation. Thus our results also provide new insights on the stability criterion of non-Hermitian crystal systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical modulation of surface response in a single plasmonic nanoresonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering of light by plasmonic nanoparticles is classically described using bulk material properties with infinitesimally thin boundaries. However, due to the quantum nature of electrons, real interfaces have finite thickness, leading to non-classical surface effects that influence light scattering in small particles. Electrical gating offers a promising route to control and study these effects, as static screening charges reside at the boundary. We investigate the modulation of the surface response upon direct electrical charging of single plasmonic nanoresonators. By analyzing measured changes in light scattering within the framework of surface-response functions, we find the resonance shift well accounted for by modulation of the classical in-plane surface current. Surprisingly, we also observed a change in the resonance width, indicating reduced losses for negatively charged resonators. This effect is attributed to a non-classical out-of-plane surface response, extending beyond pure spill-out effects. Our experiments pave the way for electrically driven plasmonic modulators and metasurfaces, leveraging control over non-classical surface effects.</description>

      <title>Switchable optical trapping of Mie-resonant phase-change nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezers revolutionized the manipulation of nanoscale objects. Typically, tunable manipulations of optical tweezers rely on adjusting either the trapping laser beams or the optical environment surrounding the nanoparticles. We present a novel approach to achieve tunable and switchable trapping using nanoparticles made of a phase-change material (vanadium dioxide or VO$_2$). By varying the intensity of the trapping beam, we induce transitions of the VO$_2$ between monoclinic and rutile phases. Depending on the nanoparticles' sizes, they exhibit one of three behaviours: small nanoparticles (in our settings, radius $&lt;0.12$ wavelength $\lambda$) remain always attracted by the laser beam in both material phases, large nanoparticles ($&gt;0.22 \lambda$) remain always repelled. However, within the size range of $0.12$-$0.22 \lambda$, the phase transition of the VO$_2$ switches optical forces between attractive and repulsive, thereby pulling/pushing them towards/away from the beam centre. The effect is reversible, allowing the same particle to be attracted and repelled repeatedly. The phenomenon is governed by Mie resonances supported by the nanoparticle and their alterations during the phase transition of the VO$_2$. This work provides an alternative solution for dynamic optical tweezers and paves a way to new possibilities, including optical sorting, light-driven optomechanics and single-molecule biophysics.</description>

      <title>All-optical source size and emittance measurements of laser-accelerated electron beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel schemes for generating ultra-low emittance electron beams have been developed in past years and promise compact particle sources with excellent beam quality suitable for future high-energy physics experiments and free-electron lasers. Recent theoretical work has proposed a laser-based method capable of resolving emittances in the sub 0.1 mm mrad regime, by modulating the electron phase-space ponderomotively. Here we present a first experimental demonstration of this scheme using a laser wakefield accelerator. The observed emittance and source size is consistent with published values. We also show calculations demonstrating that tight bounds on the upper limit for emittance and source size can be derived from the 'laser-grating' method even in the presence of low signal to noise and uncertainty in laser-grating parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian generalizations of the Yao-Lee model augmented by SO(3)-symmetry-breaking terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-Hermitian versions of the Yao-Lee model, supplemented by various kinds of SO(3)-symmetry-breaking terms, preserving the solvability of the model. The parent model hosts three species of Majorana fermions, thereby serving as an extension of the two-dimensional Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice. The non-Hermitian couplings represent generic situations when the system is coupled to the environment and, thus, undergoes dissipation. The resulting eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenmodes show a rich structure of exceptional points as well as non-Hermitian skin effects. We chart out such exotic behaviour for some representative parameter regimes.</description>
