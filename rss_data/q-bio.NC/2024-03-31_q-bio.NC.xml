Abstract: Indication of therapeutic hypothermia needs an accurate identification of brain injury in the early neonatal period. Here, we aim to provide a simple hypothermia decision-making tool for the term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) based on features of conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) taken less than 6 hours from birth. EEG recordings from one hundred full-term babies with HIE were included in the study. Each EEG recording was graded by pediatric neurologists for HIE severity. Amplitude of each EEG segment was analyzed in the slow frequency bands. Temporal fluctuations of spectral power in delta (0.5 - 4 Hz) frequency band was used to characterize each HIE grade. For each grade of abnormality, we estimated level and duration (number of consecutive segments above a given level) probability densities for power of delta oscillations. These 2D representation of EEG dynamics can identify mild HIE group from those of requiring hypothermia. Our discrimination system yielded an accuracy, recall, positive predictive value (precision), negative predictive value, false alarm ratio and F1-score of 98%, 99%, 99%, 0.94%, 0.06 and 99%, respectively. These results provided an accurate discrimination of mild versus moderate or severe HIE, and only one mild case was erroneously detected as relevant for hypothermia. Quantized probability densities of slow spectral features (delta power) from early conventional EEG (withing 6 hours of birth) revealed significant differences in slow spectral dynamics between infants with mild HIE grades and those relevant for hypothermia.</description>

      <title>ITCMA: A Generative Agent Based on a Computational Consciousness Structure</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in tasks requiring understanding implicit instructions and applying common-sense knowledge. In such scenarios, LLMs may require multiple attempts to achieve human-level performance, potentially leading to inaccurate responses or inferences in practical environments, affecting their long-term consistency and behavior. This paper introduces the Internal Time-Consciousness Machine (ITCM), a computational consciousness structure. We further propose the ITCM-based Agent (ITCMA), which supports behavior generation and reasoning in open-world settings. ITCMA enhances LLMs' ability to understand implicit instructions and apply common-sense knowledge by considering agents' interaction and reasoning with the environment. Evaluations in the Alfworld environment show that trained ITCMA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 9% on the seen set. Even untrained ITCMA achieves a 96% task completion rate on the seen set, 5% higher than SOTA, indicating its superiority over traditional intelligent agents in utility and generalization. In real-world tasks with quadruped robots, the untrained ITCMA achieves an 85% task completion rate, which is close to its performance in the unseen set, demonstrating its comparable utility in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Biologically-Plausible Topology Improved Spiking Actor Network for Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is largely attributed to utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as function approximators. Recent advances in neuroscience have unveiled that the human brain achieves efficient reward-based learning, at least by integrating spiking neurons with spatial-temporal dynamics and network topologies with biologically-plausible connectivity patterns. This integration process allows spiking neurons to efficiently combine information across and within layers via nonlinear dendritic trees and lateral interactions. The fusion of these two topologies enhances the network's information-processing ability, crucial for grasping intricate perceptions and guiding decision-making procedures. However, ANNs and brain networks differ significantly. ANNs lack intricate dynamical neurons and only feature inter-layer connections, typically achieved by direct linear summation, without intra-layer connections. This limitation leads to constrained network expressivity. To address this, we propose a novel alternative for function approximator, the Biologically-Plausible Topology improved Spiking Actor Network (BPT-SAN), tailored for efficient decision-making in DRL. The BPT-SAN incorporates spiking neurons with intricate spatial-temporal dynamics and introduces intra-layer connections, enhancing spatial-temporal state representation and facilitating more precise biological simulations. Diverging from the conventional direct linear weighted sum, the BPT-SAN models the local nonlinearities of dendritic trees within the inter-layer connections. For the intra-layer connections, the BPT-SAN introduces lateral interactions between adjacent neurons, integrating them into the membrane potential formula to ensure accurate spike firing.</description>

      <title>Artificial consciousness. Some logical and conceptual preliminaries</title>

Abstract: Is artificial consciousness theoretically possible? Is it plausible? If so, is it technically feasible? To make progress on these questions, it is necessary to lay some groundwork clarifying the logical and empirical conditions for artificial consciousness to arise and the meaning of relevant terms involved. Consciousness is a polysemic word: researchers from different fields, including neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and philosophy, among others, sometimes use different terms in order to refer to the same phenomena or the same terms to refer to different phenomena. In fact, if we want to pursue artificial consciousness, a proper definition of the key concepts is required. Here, after some logical and conceptual preliminaries, we argue for the necessity of using dimensions and profiles of consciousness for a balanced discussion about their possible instantiation or realisation in artificial systems. Our primary goal in this paper is to review the main theoretical questions that arise in the domain of artificial consciousness. On the basis of this review, we propose to assess the issue of artificial consciousness within a multidimensional account. The theoretical possibility of artificial consciousness is already presumed within some theoretical frameworks; however, empirical possibility cannot simply be deduced from these frameworks but needs independent empirical validation. We break down the complexity of consciousness by identifying constituents, components, and dimensions, and reflect pragmatically about the general challenges confronting the creation of artificial consciousness. Despite these challenges, we outline a research strategy for showing how "awareness" as we propose to understand it could plausibly be realised in artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Localising the Seizure Onset Zone from Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation Responses with a Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, and many patients require surgical intervention when medication fails to control seizures. For effective surgical outcomes, precise localisation of the epileptogenic focus - often approximated through the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is critical yet remains a challenge. Active probing through electrical stimulation is already standard clinical practice for identifying epileptogenic areas. This paper advances the application of deep learning for SOZ localisation using Single Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) responses. We achieve this by introducing Transformer models that incorporate cross-channel attention. We evaluate these models on held-out patient test sets to assess their generalisability to unseen patients and electrode placements.
  Our study makes three key contributions: Firstly, we implement an existing deep learning model to compare two SPES analysis paradigms - namely, divergent and convergent. These paradigms evaluate outward and inward effective connections, respectively. Our findings reveal a notable improvement in moving from a divergent (AUROC: 0.574) to a convergent approach (AUROC: 0.666), marking the first application of the latter in this context. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Transformer models in handling heterogeneous electrode placements, increasing the AUROC to 0.730. Lastly, by incorporating inter-trial variability, we further refine the Transformer models, with an AUROC of 0.745, yielding more consistent predictions across patients. These advancements provide a deeper insight into SOZ localisation and represent a significant step in modelling patient-specific intracranial EEG electrode placements in SPES. Future work will explore integrating these models into clinical decision-making processes to bridge the gap between deep learning research and practical healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>An internal sensory model allows for balance control based on non-actionable proprioceptive feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All motor tasks with a mechanical system (a human body, a rider on a bicycle) that is approximately linear in the part of the state space where it stays most of the time (e.g., upright balance control) have the following property: actionable sensory feedback allows for optimal control actions that are a simple linear combination of the sensory feedback. When only non-actionable sensory feedback is available, optimal control for these approximately linear mechanical systems is based on an internal dynamical system that estimates the states, and that can be implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN). It uses a sensory model to update the state estimates with the non-actionable sensory feedback, and the weights of this RNN are fully specified by results from optimal feedback control. This is highly relevant for muscle spindle afferent firing rates which, under perfectly coordinated fusimotor and skeletomotor control, scale with the exafferent joint acceleration component. The resulting control mechanism balances a standing body and a rider-bicycle combination using realistic parameter values and with forcing torques that are feasible for humans.</description>
