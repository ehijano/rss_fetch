      <title>Structural Flexibility of the TCF7L2-DNA Complex with the Type 2 Diabetes SNP rs7903146</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene has been determined as one of the strongest common genetic risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The location of the SNP in a non-coding region suggests a regulatory mechanism, meaning the SNP doesn't change the protein's own structure but rather affects how the TCF7L2 protein binds to DNA to control other genes. This binding, however, is highly dependent on the shape and flexibility of the DNA. This study aims to reveal the atomic-level effects of the SNP's cytosine-to-thymine substitution on the TCF7L2-DNA complex. We first utilized AlphaFold to generate individual high-confidence structures of the TCF7L2 protein and two 15-base pair DNA duplexes: one containing the reference C allele and one containing the variant T allele. These structures were then used as inputs for Neurosnap's Boltz2 deep learning model to generate two complete protein-DNA complexes of the TCF7L2 HMG-box bound to each DNA variant. Using the iMODS server, we conducted a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict and compare large-scale flexibility and differences in interactions between the complexes. The protein-DNA interface was dissected using PDBsum to locate atomic contacts, clefts, and interaction maps. Overall, our results show that the T allele variant exhibits increased global stiffness with a higher eigenvalue and reduced flexibility, suggesting that the SNP disrupts the mechanism and biomechanical balance needed for efficient TCF7L2-DNA binding, thus affecting downstream gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Apo2Mol: 3D Molecule Generation via Dynamic Pocket-Aware Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.</description>

      <title>ApexGen: Simultaneous design of peptide binder sequence and structure for target proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptide-based drugs can bind to protein interaction sites that small molecules often cannot, and are easier to produce than large protein drugs. However, designing effective peptide binders is difficult. A typical peptide has an enormous number of possible sequences, and only a few of these will fold into the right 3D shape to match a given protein target. Existing computational methods either generate many candidate sequences without considering how they will fold, or build peptide backbones and then find suitable sequences afterward. Here we introduce ApexGen, a new AI-based framework that simultaneously designs a peptide's amino-acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure to fit a given protein target. For each target, ApexGen produces a full all-atom peptide model in a small number of deterministic integration steps. In tests on hundreds of protein targets, the peptides designed by ApexGen fit tightly onto their target surfaces and cover nearly the entire binding site. These peptides have shapes similar to those found in natural protein-peptide complexes, and they show strong predicted binding affinity in computational experiments. Because ApexGen couples sequence and structure design at every step of Euler integration within a flow-matching sampler, it is much faster and more efficient than prior approaches. This unified method could greatly accelerate the discovery of new peptide-based therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Exploring AlphaFold 3 for CD47 Antibody-Antigen Binding Affinity: An Unexpected Discovery of Reverse docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold 3 (AF3) is a powerful biomolecular structure-predicting tool based on the latest deep learning algorithms and revolutionized AI model architectures. A few of papers have already investigated its accuracy in predicting different biomolecular structures. However, the potential applications of AF3 beyond basic structure prediction have not been fully explored. In our study, we firstly focused on structure predictions of antibody-antigen (CD47) complexes, which is believed to be challenge for AF3 due to limited resolved cognate crystallographic structures. Furtherly, we aimed to the potentiality of AF3 in performing pre-screening for potent antibody candidates as an auxiliary work through binding affinity analysis compared to other molecular docking modules of commercial software, which would greatly benefit the lead identification or optimization process in the drug development. In essence, this is not limited to antibody-antigen binding affinity, but many other chemical or physical properties of any drug candidate based on AF3's accurate predicting structures that are extremely close to the reality. According to our experimental results, AF3 is a very promising competitor, which can efficiently produce highly reliable molecular structures and subsequent binding energy predictions for most subjects. Surprisingly, an unexpected and nonrandom phenomenon "reverse docking" was observed for two of our antibody subjects, suggesting new issues arising from the architectural revolution of AF3. Our analysis and error correction experiments show that this phenomenon is likely to be caused by revolutionized AI model architectures, which provides important experience and reminders for the optimization and design direction of AI for structural prediction.

      <title>cryoSENSE: Compressive Sensing Enables High-throughput Microscopy with Sparse and Generative Priors on the Protein Cryo-EM Image Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the atomic-resolution visualization of biomolecules; however, modern direct detectors generate data volumes that far exceed the available storage and transfer bandwidth, thereby constraining practical throughput. We introduce cryoSENSE, the computational realization of a hardware-software co-designed framework for compressive cryo-EM sensing and acquisition. We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.
