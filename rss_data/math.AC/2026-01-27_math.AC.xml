      <title>On Golod Subdeterminantal Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=(x_{ij})_{m\times n}$ be a matrix of indeterminates and let $S=\mathbb{k}[x_{ij} \mid 1\leq i\leq m,\ 1\leq j\leq n]$ be a polynomial ring over an infinite field $\mathbb{k}$. Let $I$ be an ideal generated by a subset of the set of all $2\times2$ minors of $X$. We show that the quotient ring $S/I$ is Golod if and only if $I=I_2(Y)$ for some $2\times \ell$ or $\ell\times2$ submatrix $Y$ of $X$. In fact, we prove that Golodness of $S/I$ is equivalent to the triviality of the product on the Koszul homology of $S/I$ and to $I$ having a linear resolution. Along the way, we also prove a result on the non-Golodness of tensor products of rings under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Trace ideals of canonical modules over Schubert cycles and determinantal rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the canonical trace of Schubert cycles and determinantal rings. As an application, we give an explicit description of the non-Gorenstein locus and show that its structure is compatible with the known representations of the singular locus and the canonical module. Furthermore, for the CTR property recently introduced by Miyazaki, we establish its stability under base change and provide a characterization in the case of determinantal rings.</description>

      <title>Subdividing simplicial virtual resolutions with homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While sporadic examples of virtual resolutions with homology have been constructed, their occurrence is not well understood or controlled. Our results build a new set of tools for studying virtual resolutions of monomial ideals as arising from simplicial complexes, including characterizing them by the acyclicity of certain induced subcomplexes. Using this characterization, we give a description of minimal simplicial complexes supporting virtual resolutions as well as a technique for removing homology from simplicial virtual resolutions.</description>

      <title>Relative Dixmier property for Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dixmier property concerns the bijectivity of endomorphisms for algebras. We introduce a relative Dixmier property, which is a generalization of the Dixmier property. This new concept has applications in proving that several classes of Poisson algebras possess the Dixmier property, as well as in other topics such as the cancellation problem and the non-existence of Hopf coactions.</description>

      <title>Fibers of phase tropicalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subject of the present paper is phase tropicalization, which was used crucially in the context of Mikhalkin's correspondence theorem for curve counting in the complex coefficient case. The subject can be traced back to Viro's patchworking for constructing topological types of real algebraic curves. These two instances correspond to complex and real phases. Both fall into the category of what can be called "abelian" or classical tropicalization, referring to degenerations of varieties within an algebraic torus (or its compactification). In contrast, in "non-abelian" tropicalizations the ambient torus is replaced by a non-commutative group such as the special linear group. This is the beginning of a general theory valid for a wide array of coefficient systems and dimensions. As an application, the paper settles the question of phase tropicalization for the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}_2$. It also gives an algebraic explanation and phase extension of the case of curves, previously studied in the purely geometric framework. To accomplish these tasks we introduce valuative tools that allow us to prove an affine version of Kapranov's theorem on tropical hypersurfaces and its generalization to arbitrary tropical varieties. Most notably, we show the functorial properties of the graded ring of a valuation and exhibit the polynomial structure of the graded ring of monomial valuations.</description>

      <title>On Gorensteinness of associated graded rings of filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(A, \mathfrak{m})$ be a Gorenstein local ring, and $\mathcal{F} =\{F_n \}_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}$ a Hilbert filtration. In this paper, we give a criterion for Gorensteinness of the associated graded ring of $\mathcal{F}$ in terms of the Hilbert coefficients of $\mathcal{F}$ in some cases. As a consequence we recover and extend a result proved by Okuma, Watanabe and Yoshida. Further, we present ring-theoretic properties of the normal tangent cone of the maximal ideal of $A=S/(f)$ where $S=K[\![x_0,x_1,\ldots, x_m]\!]$ is a formal power series ring over an algebraically closed field $K$, and $f=x_0^a-g(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$, where $g$ is a polynomial with $g \in (x_1,\ldots,x_m)^b \setminus (x_1,\ldots,x_m)^{b+1}$, and $a, \, b, \, m$ are integers. We show that the normal tangent cone $\overline{G}(\mathfrak{m})$ is Cohen-Macaulay if $A$ is normal and $a \le b$. Moreover, we give a criterion of the Gorensteinness of $\overline{G}(\mathfrak{m})$.</description>

      <title>Bizonotopal Graphical Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zonotopal algebras (external, central, and internal) of an undirected graph G introduced by Postnikov-Shapiro and Holtz-Ron, are finite-dimensional commutative graded algebras whose Hilbert series contain a wealth of combinatorial information about G. In this paper, we associate to G a new family of algebras, which we call bizonotopal, because their definition involves doubling the set of edges of G. These algebras are monomial and have intricate properties related, among other things, to the combinatorics of graphical parking functions and their polytopes.
  Unlike the case of usual zonotopal algebras, the Hilbert series of bizonotopal algebras are not specializations of the Tutte polynomial of G. Still, we show that in the external and central cases these Hilbert series satisfy a modified deletion-contraction relation. In addition, we prove that the external bizonotopal algebra is a complete graph invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is strict normal crossing (SNC) if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of arbitrary Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. The family of these loci forms an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the minimal generators of the bihomogeneous prime ideal that defines this variety.</description>

      <title>Grobner bases for determinantal facet ideals of simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for simplicial complexes whose determinantal facet ideals admit reduced Grobner bases under diagonal term orders. Building on and extending foundational results for binomial edge ideals and determinantal ideals, we introduce two new classes of simplicial complexes-strong closed and poor closed-that generalize the notion of closedness in higher dimensions. Our main theorem offers a unified framework that recovers and refines several known results, including those for unit interval graphs and determinantal ideals of complete graphs. In particular, we correct and generalize prior characterizations of Grobner bases for determinantal facet ideals, establishing radicality for strong closed complexes and providing a new proof for the Grobner basis of maximal minors.</description>

      <title>Uniformly S-pseudo-projective modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of uniformly S-pseudo-projective (u-S-pseudo-projective) modules as a generalization of u-S-projective modules. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. An R-module P is said to be u-S-pseudo-projective if for any submodule K of P, there is s\in S such that for any u-S-epimorphism f:P\to \frac{P}{K}, sf can be lifted to an endomorphism g:P\to P. We prove that an R-module M is u-S-quasi-projective if and only if M\oplus M is u-S-pseudo-projective. Also, we prove that if A\oplus B is u-S-pseudo-projective, then any u-S-epimorphism f:A\to B u-S-splits. Several new characterizations of u-S-semisimple rings are given.</description>

      <title>Homological shifts of powers a complementary edge ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13267v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homological shift algebra and the projective dimension function of complementary edge ideals are investigated. Let $G$ be a connected graph, and let $I$ be its complementary edge ideal. For bipartite graphs $G$, we show that the projective dimension of $I^s$ increases strictly with $s$ until reaching its maximum value. For trees and cycles, explicit expressions for the projective dimension of $I^s$ are provided, along with detailed descriptions of their homological shift algebras. In particular, it is shown that the $i$-th homological shift algebra of such ideals is generated in degree at most $i$. Additionally, we prove that if $G$ is a tree, then the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_i(I^i)$, when divided by a suitable monomial, becomes a Veronese-type ideal, and every Veronese-type ideal arises in this manner.</description>

      <title>On construction of differential $\mathbb Z$-graded varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative unital algebra $\mathcal O$, a proper ideal $\mathcal I$ in $\mathcal O$, and a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O/\mathcal I$, we provide a $\mathbb Z$-graded extension, whose negative part is an arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution of $\mathcal O/ \mathcal I$. This extension is obtained through an algorithm exploiting the explicit homotopy retract data of the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution, so that the number of homological computations in the construction is significantly reduced. For a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O$ that preserves the ideal $\mathcal I$, the extension admits a manifest description in terms of decorated trees and computed data.
  As a by-product, to every Lie-Rinehart algebra over the coordinate ring of an affine variety $ W \subseteq M = \mathbb{C}^d$, one associates an explicit differential $\mathbb{Z}$-graded variety over $M$ whose negative component is the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution of the coordinate ring $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_d]/\mathcal I_W$ of $W$, and whose positive component is the universal dg-variety of the given Lie-Rinehart algebra. Concrete examples are given.</description>
