      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Bose-Hubbard model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

      <title>Quantum charges of harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Riemannian geometry of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Its wavefunction is a holomorphic section of the complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that the energy eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ with $n\ge 1$, corresponding to the energy levels $E_n$, are complex coordinates on orbifolds $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ embedded into $L_{\sf{v}}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$. In fact, $\psi_n (t,z)$ is a standing wave on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $z$ is a complex coordinate on the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$. Oscillators are characterized by two quantum charges $(q_l^{}, q_{\sf{v}})=(n,1)$, where $q_l^{}=n$ is the winding number for the group U(1) acting on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $q_{\sf{v}}^{}=1$ is the winding number for the U(1)-rotations on fibres of the bundle $L_{\sf{v}}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, and $E_n=\hbar\omega(q_l^{}+\frac{1}{2} q_{\sf{v}}).$ We also discuss ``antioscillators" with opposite quantum charges and the same positive energy.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian Structures of Partial Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first introduce the notion of Hamiltonian structure for a partial difference equation. Then we construct some infinite quivers, and realize the discrete KdV equation, the Hirota-Miwa equation and its various reductions as the mutation relations of the corresponding cluster algebras. Finally, we show that the log-canonical Poisson structures associated to these cluster algebras give the Hamiltonian structures or the bihamiltonian structures of these partial difference equations.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy for M-theory on the Quintic Threefold via F-theoretic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic black hole entropy calculations in string theory usually proceeds through identifying them as wrapped strings in one higher dimension. For M-theory on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds this proceeds via its relation to F-theory in one higher dimension. Here we show how this method can be extended to M-theory on non-elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds such as the quintic via conifold transition to elliptic threefolds. This leads to the computation of the black hole entropy through elliptic genera of the strings. However the Cardy formula for the computation of the black hole entropy of these strings fails because the relevant momentum excitations on the string are much smaller than the central charge of the strings. We show how the black hole attractor entropy formula leads to predicting corrections to the Cardy formula in this regime.</description>

      <title>Convergence Acceleration of Favre-Averaged Non-Linear Harmonic Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a numerical procedure to accelerate the convergence of the Favre-averaged Non-Linear Harmonic (FNLH) method. The scheme provides a unified mathematical framework for solving the sparse linear systems formed by the mean flow and the time-linearized harmonic flows of FNLH in an explicit or implicit fashion. The approach explores the similarity of the sparse linear systems of FNLH and leads to a memory efficient procedure, so that its memory consumption does not depend on the number of harmonics to compute. The proposed method has been implemented in the industrial CFD solver HYDRA. Two test cases are used to conduct a comparative study of explicit and implicit schemes in terms of convergence, computational efficiency, and memory consumption. Comparisons show that the implicit scheme yields better convergence than the explicit scheme and is also roughly 7 to 10 times more computationally efficient than the explicit scheme with 4 levels of multigrid. Furthermore, the implicit scheme consumes only approximately $50\%$ of the explicit scheme with four levels of multigrid. Compared with the full annulus unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, the implicit scheme produces comparable results to URANS with computational time and memory consumption that are two orders of magnitude smaller.</description>

      <title>Expansion of net correlations in terms of partial correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical models are usually employed to represent statistical relationships between pairs of variables when all the remaining variables are fixed. In this picture, conditionally independent pairs are disconnected. In the real world, however, strict conditional independence is almost impossible to prove. Here we use a weaker version of the concept of graphical models, in which only the linear component of the conditional dependencies is represented. This notion enables us to relate the marginal Pearson correlation coefficient (a measure of linear marginal dependence) with the partial correlations (a measure of linear conditional dependence). Specifically, we use the graphical model to express the marginal Pearson correlation $\rho_{ij}$ between variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ as a sum of the efficacies with which messages propagate along all the paths connecting the variables in the graph. The expansion is convergent, and provides a mechanistic interpretation of how global correlations arise from local interactions. Moreover, by weighing the relevance of each path and of each intermediate node, an intuitive way to imagine interventions is enabled, revealing for example what happens when a given edge is pruned, or the weight of an edge is modified. The expansion is also useful to construct minimal equivalent models, in which latent variables are introduced to replace a larger number of marginalised variables. In addition, the expansion yields an alternative algorithm to calculate marginal Pearson correlations, particularly beneficial when partial correlation matrix inversion is difficult. Finally, for Gaussian variables, the mutual information is also related to message-passing efficacies along paths in the graph.</description>

      <title>Braiding Fibonacci anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Realizations and star-product of doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Yang algebra was proposed a long time ago as a generalization of the Snyder algebra to the case of curved background spacetime. It includes as subalgebras both the Snyder and the de Sitter algebras and can therefore be viewed as a model of noncommutative curved spacetime. A peculiarity with respect to standard models of noncommutative geometry is that it includes translation and Lorentz generators, so that the definition of a Hopf algebra and the physical interpretation of the variables conjugated to the primary ones is not trivial. In this paper we consider the realizations of the Yang algebra and its $\kappa$-deformed generalization on an extended phase space and in this way we are able to define a Hopf structure and a twist.</description>

      <title>Monodromy of generalized Lame equations with Darboux-Treibich-Verdier potentials: A universal law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Darboux-Treibich-Verdier (DTV) potential $\sum_{k=0}^{3}n_{k}(n_{k}+1)\wp(z+\tfrac{ \omega_{k}}{2};\tau)$ is well-known as doubly-periodic solutions of the stationary KdV hierarchy (Treibich-Verdier, Duke Math. J. {\bf 68} (1992), 217-236). In this paper, we study the generalized Lam\'{e} equation with the DTV potential \begin{equation*} y^{\prime \prime }(z)=\bigg[ \sum_{k=0}^{3}n_{k}(n_{k}+1)\wp(z+\tfrac{ \omega_{k}}{2};\tau)+B\bigg] y(z),\quad n_{k}\in \mathbb{N} \end{equation*} from the monodromy aspect. We prove that the map from $(\tau, B)$ to the monodromy data $(r,s)$ satisfies a surprising universal law $d\tau\wedge dB\equiv8\pi^2 dr\wedge ds.$ Our proof applies Panlev\'{e} VI equation and modular forms. We also give applications to the algebraic multiplicity of (anti)periodic eigenvalues for the associated Hill operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider some basic problems associated with quantum mechanics of systems having a time-dependent Hilbert space. We provide a consistent treatment of these systems and address the possibility of describing them in terms of a time-independent Hilbert space. We show that in general the Hamiltonian operator does not represent an observable of the system even if it is a self-adjoint operator. This is related to a hidden geometric aspect of quantum mechanics arising from the presence of an operator-valued gauge potential. We also offer a careful treatment of quantum systems whose Hilbert space is obtained by endowing a time-independent vector space with a time-dependent inner product.</description>

Abstract: We review a recent new approach to the study of critical points of Laplacian eigenfunctions. Its core novelty is a non-standard variational principle for the eigenvalues of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on bounded, simply connected planar domains. This principle can be used to provide simple proofs of some previously known results on the hot spots conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We consider 1+1 field generalization of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model. It is shown that the Lax connection satisfies the classical non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure of Maillet type. Next, we consider 1+1 field analogue of the spin Calogero-Moser model and its multipole (or multispin) extension. Finally, we discuss the field analogue of the classical IRF-Vertex correspondence, which relates utralocal and non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structures.</description>

      <title>Why is the universe not frozen by the quantum Zeno effect?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a discrete model that simulates the ubiquitous competition between the free internal evolution of a two-level system and the decoherence induced by the interaction with its surrounding environment. It is aimed at being as universal as possible, so that no specific Hamiltonian is assumed. This leads to an analytic criterion, depending on the level of short time decoherence, allowing to determine whether the system will freeze due to the Zeno effect. We check this criterion on several classes of functions which correspond to different physical situations. In the most generic case, the free evolution wins over decoherence, thereby explaining why the universe is indeed not frozen.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $U(n)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the unitary group $U(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT with global $U(n)$ symmetry, which exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $U(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

Abstract: The symplectic/orthogonal contents of partitions are related to the dimensions of irreducible representations of symplectic/orthogonal groups. In 2012, motivated by Nekrasov-Okounkov's hook-length formula and Stanley's hook-content formula, Amdeberhan proposed several conjectures about infinite product formulas for certain generating functions of hook-lengths and symplectic/orthogonal contents. Some special cases of his conjectures were recently proved by Amdeberhan, Andrews and Ballantine. In this paper, we prove the general cases of Amdeberhan's conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>How much symmetry do symmetric measurements need for efficient operational applications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of symmetric measurements to collections of unequinumerous positive, operator-valued measures (POVMs). For informationally complete sets, we propose construction methods from orthonormal Hermitian operator bases. The correspondence between operator bases and measurements can be as high as four-to-four, with a one-to-one correspondence following only under additional assumptions. Importantly, it turns out that some of the symmetry properties, lost in the process of generalization, can be recovered without fixing the same number of elements for all POVMs. In particular, for a wide class of unequinumerous symmetric measurements that are conical 2-designs, we derive the index of coincidence, entropic uncertainty relations, and separability criteria for bipartite quantum states.</description>

      <title>Reaching Curzon-Ahlborn limit in linear response and Whitney limit in nonlinear response in edge mode quantum thermoelectrics and refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. For the first time, we see that the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear transport regimes are achieved using quantum point contacts in the same setup.</description>

Abstract: The Berezin-Karpelevich integral is a double integral over unitary matrices which plays the role of the Itzykson-Zuber integral in rectangular matrix models. We obtain a topological expansion of the Berezin-Karpelevich integral in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers, and obtain from this certain combinatorial identities.</description>

      <title>A Turbulent Fluid Mechanics via Nonlinear 'Mixing' of Smooth Velocity Flows With Weighted Random Fields: Stochastically Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations and Velocity Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$, with ${Vol}(\mathfrak{D})\sim L^{3}$, contain an incompressible fluid of viscosity $\nu$ and velocity $\mathrm{U}_{i}(x,t)$ with $(x,t)\in\mathfrak{D}\times[0,\infty)$, satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations with some boundary conditions on $\partial\mathfrak{D}$ and evolving from initial Cauchy data. Now let $\mathscr{B}(x)$ be a Gaussian random field defined for all $x\in\mathfrak{D}$ with expectation $\mathbb{I\!E}\langle\mathscr{B}(x)\rangle=0$, and a Bargmann-Fock binary correlation $\mathbb{I\!E}\big\langle\mathscr{B}(x)\otimes \mathscr{B}({y})\big\rangle=\mathsf{C}\exp(-\|{x}-{y}\|^{2}\lambda^{-2})$ with $\lambda\le {L}$. Define a volume-averaged Reynolds number $\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t) =(|Vol(\mathfrak{D})|^{-1}\int_{\mathfrak{D}}\|\mathrm{U}_{i}(x,t)\|d\mu({x}){L}/\nu$. The critical Reynolds number is $\mathbf{Re}_{c}(\mathfrak{D})$ so that turbulence fully evolves within $\mathfrak{D}$ for $t$ such that $\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)&gt;\mathbf{Re}_{c}(\mathfrak{D})$. Let $\psi(|\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)-\mathbf{Re}_{c}(\mathfrak{D})|)$ be an arbitrary monotone-increasing weighting functional. The turbulent flow evolving within $\mathfrak{D}$ is described by the random field $\mathscr{U}_{i}(x,t)$ via a 'mixing' ansatz $\mathscr{U}_{i}(x,t)=\mathrm{U}_{i}(x,t)+\beta\mathrm{U}_{i}(x,t) \big\lbrace\psi(|\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)-\mathbf{Re}_{c}(\mathfrak{D})|)\big\rbrace \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{S}}[\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)\big]\mathscr{B}(x)$ where ${\beta}\ge 1$ is a constant and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{S}}[\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)]$ an indicator function. The flow grows increasingly random if $\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)$ increases with $t$ so that this is a 'control parameter'. The turbulent flow $\mathscr{U}_{i}(x,t)$ is a solution of stochastically averaged N-S equations. Reynolds-type velocity correlations are estimated.</description>

      <title>Loop Vertex Representation for Cumulants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct cumulants for stable random matrix models with single trace interactions of arbitrarily high even order. We obtain explicit and convergent expansions for the cumulants. We show that any cumulant is an analytic function inside a cardioid domain in the complex plane and we prove their Borel-LeRoy summability at the origin of the coupling constant. Our proof is uniform in the external variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faddeev' equations are a set-theoretical and an operator forms of the star-triangle equation. Known solutions of the quantum star-triangle equation, related to the Faddeev equations, are based on various forms of the modular double of the Weyl algebra including its cyclic representation. We show in this paper that Fadeev's equation also leads to a solution of the quantum star-triangle equation even in the case of a simple Weyl algebra with $|q|&lt;1$. This paper can be seen as an addendum to the recent paper "V. Bazhanov and S. Sergeev, A distant descendant of the six-vertex model, arXiv:2310.08427".</description>

      <title>Functional Bethe Ansatz for a $\sinh$-Gordon model with real $q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bazhanov and Sergeev have described an Ising-type integrable model which can be identified as a $\sinh$-Gordon-type model with an infinite number of states but with a real parameter $q$. This model is the subject of Sklyanin's Functional Bethe Ansatz. We develop in this paper the whole technique of the FBA which includes:
  1. Construction of eigenstates of an off-diagonal element of a monodromy matrix. Most important ingredients of these eigenstates are the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients of the corresponding representation.
  2. Separately, we discuss the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients, as well as the Wigner's 6j symbols, in details. The later are rather well known in the theory of $3D$ indices.
  Thus, the Sklyanin basis of the quantum separation of variables is constructed. The matrix elements of an eigenstate of the auxiliary transfer matrix in this basis are products of functions satisfying the Baxter equation. Such functions are called usually the $Q$-operators. We investigate the Baxter equation and $Q$-operators from two points of view.
  3. In the model considered the most convenient Bethe-type variables are the zeros of a Wronskian of two well defined particular solutions of the Baxter equation. This approach works perfectly in the thermodynamic limit. We calculate the distribution of these roots in the thermodynamic limit, and so we reproduce in this way the partition function of the model.
  4. The real parameter $q$, which is the standard quantum group parameter, plays the role of the absolute temperature in the model considered. Expansion with respect to $q$ (tropical expansion) gives an alternative way to establish the structure of the eigenstates. In this way we classify the elementary excitations over the ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification of emergent spinor fields according to modified bilinear covariants is scrutinized, in spacetimes with nontrivial topology, which induce inequivalent spin structures. Extended Clifford algebras, constructed by equipping the underlying spacetime with an extended bilinear form with additional terms coming from the nontrivial topology, naturally yield emergent extended algebraic spinor fields and their subsequent extended bilinear covariants, which are contrasted to the classical spinor classification. An unexpected duality between the standard and the exotic spinor field classes is therefore established, showing that a complementary fusion process among the spinor field classes sets in, when extended Clifford bundles are addressed in multiply-connected spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Resurgent Structure of the Topological String and the First Painlev\'e Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02080v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit formula for the Stokes automorphism acting on the topological string partition function. When written in terms of the dual partition function, our formula implies that flat coordinates in topological string theory transform as quantum periods, and according to the Delabaere-Dillinger-Pham formula. We first show how the formula follows from the non-linear Stokes phenomenon of the Painlev\'e I equation, together with the connection between its $\tau$-function and topological strings on elliptic curves. Then, we show that this formula is also a consequence of a recent conjecture on the resurgent structure of the topological string, based on the holomorphic anomaly equations, and it is in fact valid for arbitrary Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of the mathematical and mechanical properties of thermoelastic coupling tensors in anisotropic laminates is the topic of this paper. Some theoretical results concerning the compliance tensors are shown and their mechanical consequences analyzed. Moreover, the case of thermally stable laminates, important for practical applications, is also considered. The study is carried out in the framework of the polar method, a mathematical formalism particularly well suited for the analysis of planar anisotropic problems, introduced by Prof. G. Verchery in 1979.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem of Overlap for the Mean Field Ghatak-Sherrington model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ghatak-Sherrington (GS) spin glass model is a random probability measure defined on the configuration space $\{0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots, \pm \mathcal{S} \}^N$ with system size $N$ and $\mathcal{S}\ge1$ finite. This generalizes the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model on the boolean cube $\{-1,+1\}^N$ in order to capture more complex behaviors, including the spontaneous inverse freezing phenomenon. Although many results on the physics side have been established to understand the GS model, mathematical exploration of the model remains scarce. Overlap, the normalized inner product of two configurations, acts as the system order parameter to understand the phase transition of mean-field spin glass models. In this paper, we use moment method combined with the cavity approach to rigorously establish a quantitative joint central limit theorem for the overlap and self-overlap array. The results hold at high temperatures under arbitrary crystal and external fields. Compared to the SK model, the main challenge comes from the non-trivial self-overlap terms which also correlated with the standard overlap terms.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum discord of an arbitrary two-qudit state: the exact value and general upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result indicates that the lower bound on the geometric quantum discord found in [Phys. Rev. A. 85, 204102 (2012)] is attained on each two-qudit state and also, includes all the known exact results on the geometric discord only as particular cases. Moreover, it allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the new general upper bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state and in case of a pure two-qudit state -- in terms of its concurrence.</description>
