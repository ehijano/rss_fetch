      <title>Interplay of electronic correlations and chemical bonding in FeN$_2$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a theoretical study of the effects of electronic correlations, magnetic properties, and chemical bonding in the recently synthesized high-pressure orthorhombic phase of FeN$_2$ using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach. Our analysis documents a complex crystal-chemical behavior of FeN$_2$ characterized by the formation of a strongly covalent N-N bond with an unexpected valence state of Fe ions $3+$ (paramagnetic ferric Fe$^{3+}$ ions in the low-spin state), in agreement with available experimental data. Our results reveal weak (orbital-dependent) correlation effects, which are complicated by the possible emergence of multiple spin density wave states on a microscopic level. This suggests the importance of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations to explain the properties of FeN$_2$ under pressure.</description>

      <title>Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy on Magnetic Van der Waals Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of research on magnetic van der Waals compounds -- a special subclass of quasi-two-dimensional materials -- is currently rapidly expanding due to the relevance of these compounds to fundamental research where they serve as a playground for the investigation of different models of quantum magnetism and also in view of their unique magneto-electronic and magneto-optical properties pertinent to novel technological applications. The Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy plays an important role in the exploration of the rich magnetic behavior of van der Waals compounds due to its high sensitivity to magnetic anisotropies and unprecedentedly high energy resolution that altogether enable one to obtain thorough insights into the details of the spin structure in the magnetically ordered state and the low-energy spin dynamics in the ordered and paramagnetic phases. This article provides an overview of the recent achievements in this field made by the ESR spectroscopic techniques encompassing representatives of antiferro- and ferromagnetic van der Waals compounds of different crystal structures and chemical composition as well as of a special category of these materials termed magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Searching for new heavy fermions with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models were developed and implemented to aid the search for new heavy fermion compounds. For the purpose of these calculations a database of more than 200 heavy fermions was compiled from the literature. The deep learning networks trained on the database were then used for regression calculations, and predictions were made about the coherence temperature, Sommerfeld coefficient and carrier effective mass of potential new heavy fermions. Classification calculations were also performed in order to check whether predicted heavy fermions are superconducting and/or antiferromagnetic. Chemical composition was the only physical predictor used during the learning process. Suggestions were made for future improvements in terms of expanding the database, as well as for other artificial intelligence calculations.</description>

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic quantum many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling van Hove singularity modulation and fluctuated charge order in kagome superconductor $\rm{CsV_3Sb_5}$ via time-resolved ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, which exhibits intertwined unconventional charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, has garnered significant attention recently. Despite extensive static studies, the nature of these exotic electronic orders remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the non-equilibrium electronic structure of CsV3Sb5 via time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results reveal that upon laser excitation, the van Hove singularities immediately shift towards the Fermi level and subsequently oscillate in sync with a 1.3 THz coherent phonon mode. By analyzing the coherent intensity oscillations in the energy-momentum (E-k) map, we find that this coherent phonon is strongly coupled with electronic bands from both Sb and V orbitals. While typically observable only in the CDW state, remarkably, we find that the 1.3-THz coherent phonon mode can be persistently excited at temperatures above T_CDW, suggesting the potential existence of fluctuated CDW in CsV3Sb5. These findings enhance our understanding of the unconventional CDW control of kagome superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Distinct moir\'e trions in a twisted semiconductor homobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fascinating properties discovered in graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices originate from flat bands and enhanced many-body effects. Here, we discover new many-electron excited states in TMD homobilayers. As optical resonances evolve with twist angle and doping in MoSe$_2$ bilayers, a unique type of ``charge-transfer" trions is observed when gradual changes in atomic alignment between the layers occur. In real space, the optically excited electron-hole pair mostly resides in a different site from the doped hole in a moir\'e supercell. In momentum space, the electron-hole pair forms in the single-particle-band $K$-valley, while the hole occupies the $\Gamma$-valley. The rich internal structure of this trion resonance arises from the ultra-flatness of the first valence band and the distinct influence of moir\'e potential modulation on holes and excitons. Our findings open new routes to realizing photon-spin transduction or implementing moir\'e quantum simulators with independently tunable fermion and boson densities.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis on the origin of the double-well band dispersion in the CuO double chains of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ and its impact on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ is a unique member of cuprate superconductors where many studies suggest that CuO double chains are responsible for superconductivity. One characteristic and non-trivial feature of its electronic structure is a relatively large electron hopping $t$ between nearest neighbor Cu sites with a Cu-O-Cu angle of around 90 degrees. In this study, we have theoretically pinned down the origin of a large $|t|$ in the double-chain structure of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ using first-principles calculation and tight-binding-model analysis. We have found that, in the nearest neighbor hopping $t$, $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$-$p$-$d$ contributions roughly cancel each other out and the $d$-$p$-$d$ hopping path enhanced by the local distortion of the double chain is a key to get the large $|t|$. Double-well band dispersion arising from the relatively large $|t/t'|$ allows the enhancement of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity by the incipient-band mechanism, where the one band bottom plays a role of the incipient valley. Our study provides the important knowledge to understand the unique superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonons and Quasiparticle Renormalization in Semimetals from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent phonons, light-induced coherent lattice vibrations in solids, provide a powerful route to engineer structural and electronic degrees of freedom using light. In this manuscript, we formulate an ab initio theory of the displacive excitation of coherent phonons (DECP), the primary mechanism for light-induced structural control in semimetals. Our study - based on the ab initio simulations of the ultrafast electron and coherent-phonon dynamics in presence of electron-phonon interactions - establishes a predictive computational framework for describing the emergence of light-induced structural changes and the ensuing transient band-structure renormalization arising from the DECP mechanism. We validate this framework via a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of coherent phonons in the elemental semimetal antimony. Via a Fourier analysis of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) measurements, we retrieve information about transient spectral features and quasiparticle renormalization arising from the coherent A1g phonon as a function of momentum, energy, time, and fluence. The qualitative and quantitative agreement between experiment and theory corroborates the first-principles approach formulated in this study. Besides advancing the fundamental understanding of electron-phonon interactions mediated by coherent phonons, this study opens new opportunities for predictively engineering structural and electronic degrees of freedom in semimetals via the DECP mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators: The Case of EuIn$_2$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, ultrafast optical spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the intricate topological features of EuIn$_2$As$_2$, a promising candidate for a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator. Our investigation, focusing on the real-time evolution of topological states, unveiled a narrow surface magnetic gap (2$\Delta_0$ $\simeq$ 8.2 meV)) emerging at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_N$ $\approx$ 16 K). Below $T_N$, two extremely low-energy collective modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with frequencies of $\sim$9.9 and 21.6 GHz at $T$ = 4 K, respectively, were observed, exhibiting strong temperature dependence. $\omega_1$ correlates with an acoustic phonon, while $\omega_2$ is associated with a magnon. The results suggest that EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has the potential to manifest a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator, presenting a small magnetic energy gap on the (001) surface. The findings further our understanding of the interplay between magnetism and topology in this material, showcasing its potential for applications in quantum information processing and spintronics.</description>

      <title>General Shiba mapping for on-site four-point correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16115v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the Shiba mapping on the two particle level, we derive the relation between the local four-point correlation functions of bipartite lattice models with on-site electronic repulsion and those of the corresponding models with attractive interaction in the most general setting. In particular, we extend the results of [Phys. Rev. B, 101, 155148 (2020)], which were limited to the rather specific situation of the static limit in strictly particle-hole symmetric models, (i) by explicitly including both magnetic field and different values of the chemical potentials, and (ii) by considering the full dependence of the generalized susceptibilities on the transfer (bosonic) Matsubara frequency. The derived formalism is then applied, as a relevant benchmark, to the Hubbard atom, by investigating the general properties of the divergences of its irreducible vertex functions as a function of chemical potential and applied magnetic field. The resulting phase-diagrams provide an insightful compass for future studies of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation expansion beyond high-symmetric regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a classical limit grounded in SU(4) coherent states to investigate the temperature-dependent dynamical spin structure factor of the $S = 1/2$ ladder consisting of weakly coupled dimers. By comparing the outcomes of this classical approximation with density matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization calculations in finite size ladders, we demonstrate that the classical dynamics offers an accurate approximation across the entire temperature range when the interdimer coupling is weak and a good approximation in the high temperature regime even when the interdimer coupling is strong. This agreement is achieved after appropriately rescaling the temperature axis and renormalizing expectation values to satisfy a quantum sum rule, following D. Dahlbom et al. [Phys. Rev. B 109, 014427 (2024)]. We anticipate the method will be particularly effective when applied to 2D and 3D lattices composed of weakly-coupled dimers, situations that remain challenging for alternative numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Constraints on real space representations of Chern bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Chern band is characterized by a Wannier obstruction indicating the absence of a basis of complete, orthogonal, and exponentially-localized states. Here, we study the properties of real space bases of a Chern band obtained by relaxing either exponential localization or orthogonality and completeness. This yields two distinct real space representations of a band with Chern number $C$: (i) a basis of complete orthogonal Wannier states which decay as power-law and (ii) a basis of exponentially-localized overcomplete non-orthogonal coherent states. For (i), we show that the power-law tail only depends on the Chern number and provide an explicit gauge choice leading to the universal asymptotic $w({\boldsymbol r}) \approx \frac{C e^{-i C \varphi_{\boldsymbol r}}}{2\pi |{\boldsymbol r}|^2}$ up to a normalized Bloch-periodic spinor. For (ii), we prove a rigorous lower bound on the spatial spread that can always be saturated for ideal bands. We provide an explicit construction of the maximally localized coherent state by mapping the problem to a dual Landau level problem where the Berry curvature and trace of the quantum metric take the roles of an effective magnetic field and scalar potential, respectively. Our coherent state result rigorously bounds the spatial spread of any localized state constructed as a linear superposition of wavefunctions within the Chern band. Remarkably, we find that such bound does not generically scale with the Chern number and provide an explicit example of an exponentially localized state in a Chern $C$ band whose size does not increase with $|C|$. Our results show that band topology can be encoded in a real space description and set the stage for a systematic study of interaction effects in topological bands in real space.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum critical points in fermionic systems with spin-charge separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are exotic transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. They are associated to a one-point gap closing between distinct locally ordered phases, thus to a continuous phase transition. Because of this intrinsic criticality, at deconfined quantum critical points algebraic decay of all the correlation functions is expected. Here, we show that it is possible to go beyond this assumption. Specifically, we consider one dimensional interacting fermions where the phenomenon of spin-charge separation arises. We first explore the low energy regimes where a sine-Gordon Hamiltonian can provide accurate results. By means of a field theory approach we find that continuous phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can occur. As a consequence of the decoupled spin and charge degrees of freedom, we find that in two cases only one gap vanishes while the other remains finite. We then derive a microscopic model where such phase transitions take place. By performing a numerical analysis, we unambiguously find that deconfined quantum critical points can indeed be further characterized by the long-range order of a parity operator signaling the presence of a finite gap. Our results provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum battery with non-Hermitian charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a design of a quantum battery exploiting the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian as a charger. In particular, starting with the ground or the thermal state of the interacting (non-interacting) Hamiltonian as the battery, the charging of the battery is performed via parity-time (PT)- and rotational-time (RT)-symmetric Hamiltonian to store energy. We report that such a quenching with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian leads to an enhanced power output compared to a battery with a Hermitian charger. We identify the region in the parameter space which provides the gain in performance. We also demonstrate that the improvements persist with the increase of system size for batteries with both PT- and RT-symmetric chargers. In the PT-symmetric case, although the anisotropy of the XY model does not help in the performance, we show that the XXZ model as a battery with a non-Hermitian charger performs better than that of the XX model having certain interaction strengths. We also exhibit that the advantage of non-Hermiticity remains valid even at finite temperatures in the initial states.</description>

      <title>Mimicking quantum correlation of a long-range Hamiltonian by finite-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum long-range extended Ising model possesses several striking features that cannot be observed in the corresponding short-range model. We report that the pattern obtained from the entanglement between any two arbitrary sites of the long-range model can be mimicked by the model having a finite range of interactions provided the interaction strength is moderate. On the other hand, we illustrate that when the interactions are strong, the entanglement distribution in the long-range model does not match the class of a model with a few interactions. We also show that the monogamy score of entanglement is in good agreement with the behavior of pairwise entanglement. Specifically, it saturates when the entanglement in the finite-range Hamiltonian behaves similarly to the long-range model, while it decays algebraically otherwise.</description>

      <title>Towards heavy-mass ab initio nuclear structure: Open-shell Ca, Ni and Sn isotopes from Bogoliubov coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in nuclear many-body theory enabled the description of open-shell medium-mass nuclei from first principles by exploiting the spontaneous breaking of symmetries within correlation expansion methods. Once combined with systematically improvable inter-nucleon interactions consistently derived from chiral effective field theory, modern ab initio nuclear structure calculations provide a powerful framework to deliver first-principle predictions accompanied with theoretical uncertainties. In this Letter, controlled ab initio Bogoliubov coupled cluster (BCC) calculations are performed for the first time, targeting the ground-state of all calcium, nickel and tin isotopes up to mass A ~ 180. While showing good agreement with available experimental data, the shell structure evolution in neutron-rich isotopes and the location of the neutron drip-lines are predicted. The BCC approach constitutes a key development towards reliable first-principles simulations of heavy-mass open-shell nuclei.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing: an inverse paradigm of quantum reservoir computing for exploring quantum many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a brain-inspired computational paradigm, exploiting natural dynamics of a quantum system for information processing. To date, a multitude of quantum systems have been utilized in the QRC, with diverse computational capabilities demonstrated accordingly. This study proposes a reciprocal research direction: probing quantum systems themselves through their information processing performance in the QRC framework. Building upon this concept, here we develop quantum reservoir probing (QRP), an inverse extension of the QRC. The QRP establishes an operator-level linkage between physical properties and performance in computing. A systematic scan of this correspondence reveals intrinsic quantum dynamics of the reservoir system from computational and informational perspectives. Unifying quantum information and quantum matter, the QRP holds great promise as a potent tool for exploring various aspects of quantum many-body physics. In this study, we specifically apply it to analyze information propagation in a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We demonstrate that the QRP not only distinguishes between ballistic and diffusive information propagation, reflecting the system's dynamical characteristics, but also identifies system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Selective-Area Epitaxy of Bulk-Insulating (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films and Nanowires by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

      <title>Feedback loop dependent charge density wave imaging by scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) is a unique technique to probe the local density of states (LDOS) at the atomic scale by measuring the tunneling conductance between a sharp tip and a sample surface. However, the technique suffers of well-known limitations, the so-called set-point effect, which can potentially introduce artifacts in the measurements. We compare several STS imaging schemes applied to the LDOS modulations of the charge density wave state on atomically flat surfaces, and demonstrate that only constant-height STS is capable of mapping the intrinsic LDOS. In the constant-current STS, commonly used and easier-to-implement, the tip-sample distance variations imposed by the feedback loop result in set-point-dependent STS images and possibly mislead the identification of the CDW gap edges.</description>

      <title>Optimizing one dimensional superconducting diodes: Interplay of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the non-reciprocal nature of the critical current (maximum current that a superconductor can withstand before turning into a normal metal) of a superconducting device. Here, we investigate SDE in helical superconductors with broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, focusing on a prototypical Rashba nanowire device proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subjected to external magnetic fields. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field formalism, we analyze the interplay between linear and higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC), bulk supercurrents, and external magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate that Rashba nanowires with only linear SOC can achieve incredibly large diode efficiencies &gt; 45% through the interplay of longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. Notably, higher-order SOC introduces qualitatively different behavior, enabling finite diode efficiency even in the absence of a longitudinal Zeeman field due to inherent energy dispersion asymmetry. We present a comprehensive phase diagram of the device elucidating the emergent Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state and demonstrate that proximitized Rashba nanowires offer a versatile, practical platform for SDE, with potential realizations in existing material systems. These results provide crucial insights for optimizing SDE in nanoscale superconducting devices, paving the way for next-generation dissipationless quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>
