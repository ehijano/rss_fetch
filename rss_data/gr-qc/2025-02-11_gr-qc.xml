      <title>Formation of Singularity and Apparent Horizon for Dissipative Collapse in $f(R,T)$ Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of isotropic matter undergoing dissipation in the form of heat flux, with a generalized Vaidya exterior, in the context of $f(R, T)$ gravity. Choosing $f(R, T)=R+2\lambda T$, and applying the $f(R, T)$ junction conditions on the field equations for the interior and exterior regions, we have obtained matching conditions of the matter-Lagrangian and its derivatives across the boundary. The time of formation of singularity and the time of formation of apparent horizon have been determined and constraints on the integration constants are examined for which the final singularity is hidden behind the horizon.</description>

      <title>Evolution of black hole echo modes and the causality dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that black hole quasinormal modes are subject to spectral instability, typically triggered by metric perturbations. These perturbations, which can introduce a minor bump in the effective potential of the wave equation, give rise to a novel branch of asymptotic quasinormal modes, dubbed the {\it echo modes}, which lie mainly parallel to the real frequency axis. This study explores the evolution of the echo modes and their interplay with the outward spiral motion observed in low-lying quasinormal modes. As the bump in the effective potential moves away from the central black hole, the echo modes collectively shift toward the real axis, with the spacing between successive modes decreasing uniformly. This collective motion occurs simultaneously with the spiral of the low-lying modes until the echo modes eventually take over the fundamental quasinormal mode. In the time domain, such a takeover coincides with a transition point for the temporal waveform, where the distinction between the original black hole's ringdown and the echoes becomes clear. This marks a transition in the characteristics of the waveform from primarily damped oscillations, dominated by the damping rate of the fundamental mode, to echo waves, characterized by periodic echo pulses. We argue that this phenomenon is universal by employing analytical and numerical analyses. We first elucidate our arguments using explicit but simplified toy models, where the effective potential barriers are disjoint. The derivations are then generalized to scenarios where perturbations are introduced on top of a black hole metric with a continuous effective potential. The observational implications, particularly the causality dilemma, are elaborated. We show that the echo modes can be extracted by applying the Fourier transform to ringdown waveforms, which can be important for gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Addressing the so called quantum/classical "divide" in gravitational contexts, and its implications in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manner in which one approaches the interface between gravitation and quantum theory is influenced by one's posture regarding quantum mechanics and the issues that revolve about its interpretational problems. We discuss here the way in which these issues occur in the inflationary cosmology setting, the serious confusions that ensue, and one path that we have used to deal with the problem which perhaps surprisingly ends up, not just offering a conceptually clear physical picture, but also modifying some of the standard observational predictions of the inflationary approach.</description>

      <title>Instability Analysis of Massive Static Phantom Wormholes via the Spectral Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the spectral method, we investigate the scalar and axial quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massive static phantom wormholes. Our results reveal the existence of purely imaginary QNMs that were not identified in previous studies, suggesting potential (in)stabilities as the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius to the wormhole throat varies within a specific range. For scalar perturbations, instabilities arise when this ratio exceeds $1.0$, with the threshold value of $1.0$ itself included. In the case of axial perturbations, the onset of instability occurs at smaller ratios, reflecting the impact of gravitational waves on the wormhole's stability. The findings suggest that the wormhole remains stable when the throat size significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius. Our results align with existing literature but offer new insights into the stability conditions of phantom wormholes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mechanism of vacuum energy compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of vacuum energy compensation due to interaction of a scalar field $\phi$ with curvature scalar of the form $\beta R \phi^2 f(\phi) $ is proposed. It is shown that with a simple power form of $f(\phi)$ the exponential expansion, induced by vacuum energy (or what is the same by cosmological constant), is transformed into canonical cosmological evolution of the universe dominated by relativistic matter.</description>

      <title>Paradox No More: How Stimulated Emission of Radiation Preserves Information Absorbed by Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes have been implicated in two paradoxes that involve apparently non-unitary dynamics. According to Hawking's theory, information that is absorbed by a black hole is destroyed, and the originally pure state of a black hole is converted to a mixed state upon complete evaporation. Here we address one of the two, namely the apparent loss of (classical) information when it crosses the event horizon. We show that this paradox is due to a mistake in Hawking's original derivation: he ignored the contribution of the stimulated emission of radiation that according to Einstein's theory of blackbody radiance must accompany the spontaneous emission (the Hawking radiation). Resurrecting the contribution of stimulated emission makes it possible to calculate the (positive) classical information transmission capacity of black holes, which implies that information is fully recoverable from the radiation outside the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian orbital evolution and gravitational wave forms of inspiralling compact binaries with mass transfer and spin corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the effects of mass transfer between binary stars and stellar spin on the post-Newtonian (PN) orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of compact binary systems. We employ the 2.5PN approximation and the mass quadrupole formula to compute the orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms. After an exhaustive discussion of the astrophysical processes relevant to the scenarios of interest, we summarize a one-dimensional mass transfer model that uniformly treats common envelope evolution and tidal disruption, and derive an approximate expression for the dependence of the mass transfer rate of the material flow through the first Lagrange point L1 on the orbital angular velocity. Furthermore, based on the perturbed Keplerian approach, we present a two-dimensional model for the orbital evolution of compact binary systems that simultaneously accounts for mass transfer and stellar spin corrections. Through numerical simulations, we investigate binary systems with significant relativistic effects, namely NS-NS (neutron star-neutron star), NS-BH (neutron star-black hole), and BH-BH (black hole-black hole) systems, and demonstrate the influence of mass transfer and spin corrections on the orbital evolution and polarization waveforms of gravitational waves of these compact binaries systems.</description>

      <title>Transition from Regular Black Holes to Wormholes in Covariant Effective Quantum Gravity: Scattering, Quasinormal Modes, and Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the Hamiltonian constraints approach, a quantum-corrected solution has been derived \cite{Zhang:2024ney}, which describes either a regular black hole or a traversable wormhole, contingent upon the value of the quantum parameter. In this work, we compute the quasinormal modes associated with axial gravitational and test fields' perturbations of these objects. We see that due to quantum corrections near the event horizon, the first several overtones deviate from their Schwarzschild values at an increasing rate. The transition between the black hole and wormhole states is marked by modifications in the late-time signal. Our findings reveal that the fundamental quasinormal modes of quantum-corrected black holes exhibit only slight deviations from those of the classical Schwarzschild solution. However, at the transition, the spectrum undergoes significant changes, with the wormhole state characterized by exceptionally long-lived quasinormal modes. In addition, we calculate absorption cross-sections of partial waves, grey-body factors and energy emission rates of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>A `singular' bounce in the theory of gravity with non-minimal derivative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore bounce scenarios in the framework of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models with arbitrary spatial curvature in the theory of gravity with non-minimal derivative coupling. As expected, we find that there are no turning points and/or bounces in cosmological models with negative or zero spatial curvature. At the same time, both a turning point and a bounce can exist in the model with positive spatial curvature. In particular, the bounce is happened at $\tau=\tau_*$ when $a(\tau_*)=a_{min} =(3\zeta\Omega_2)^{1/2}$, where $\tau=H_0 t$ is a dimensionless cosmic time. It is important fact that the value $a_{min}$ depends {\em only} on $\zeta$ and $\Omega_2$, and does {\em not} depend on $\Omega_0$, $\Omega_3$ and $\Omega_4$. We find that near the bounce $a(\tau)\approx a_{min}(1+\Delta\tau^2/18\zeta)$ and $h(\tau)\approx \Delta\tau/9\zeta$, where $\Delta\tau=\tau-\tau_*$. Thus, the scale factor $a(\tau)$, the Hubble parameter $h(\tau)$, and all corresponding geometrical invariants have a regular behavior near the bounce. As well the values characterizing matter energy densities, such as $\rho_m\sim a^{-3}$ and $\rho_r\sim a^{-4}$, are regular near the bounce. Nevertheless, though the spacetime geometry and energy densities remain to be regular near the bounce, the scalar field has a singular behavior there. Namely, $\phi'\propto 1/\Delta\tau^2 \to\infty$ as $\Delta\tau\to 0$. As a result, we conclude that the complete dynamical system describing the cosmological evolution in theory of gravity with non-minimal derivative coupling is singular near the bounce. On our knowledge, such the scenario, when the spacetime geometry and matter energy densities remain to be regular at approaching the universe evolution to the moment of bounce, while the behavior of scalar field becomes singular, was unknown before. For this reason, we term this scenario as a {\em `singular' bounce}.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Thermodynamics and Generalised Non-Extensive Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of this work provides a review of recent research on generalised entropies and their origin, as well as its application to black hole thermodynamics. To start, it is shown that the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are, respectively, the only possible thermodynamical temperature and entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, it is investigated if the other known generalised entropies, which include R\'enyi's entropy, the Tsallis one, and the four- and five-parameter generalised entropies, could correctly yield the Hawking temperature and the ADM mass. The possibility that generalised entropies could describe hairy black hole thermodynamics is also considered, both for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole and for Einstein's gravity coupled with two scalar fields. Two possibilities are investigated, namely, the case when the ADM mass does not yield the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the case in which the effective mass expressing the energy inside the horizon does not yield the Hawking temperature. For the model with two scalar fields, the radii of the photon sphere and of the black hole shadow are calculated, which gives constraints on the BH parameters. These constraints are seen to be consistent, provided the black hole is of Schwarzschild type. Subsequently, the origin of the generalised entropies is investigated, by using their microscopic particle descriptions in the frameworks of a microcanonical and of a canonical ensemble, respectively. To finish, the McLaughlin expansion for the generalised entropies is used to derive, in each case, the microscopic interpretation of the generalised entropies, via the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Clocks in ADM-Based Canonical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of time in canonical quantum gravity remains one of the most significant challenges, primarily due to the ``frozen'' formalism emerging from the Wheeler--DeWitt equation. Within the ADM formalism, we introduce a novel approach in which a scalar field is treated as a stochastic clock. By imposing a divergence-free condition on the scalar momentum, we integrate out quantum gravitational fluctuations and derive an effective noise term via the Hubbard--Stratonovich transformation. This noise drives dynamic adjustments in spacetime foliations, enabling a Schr\"{o}dinger-like evolution that preserves diffeomorphism invariance and, upon noise averaging, maintains unitary evolution. Interestingly, by introducing stochastic variations in the foliations, the quantum indeterminacy of the clock recasts time as a diffusive process emerging from quantum fluctuations -- where correlations between matter and geometry replace an absolute time parameter. This is considerably a potential pathway for understanding quantum time evolution while maintaining background independence in canonical quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Does acceleration always degrade quantum entanglement for tetrapartite Unruh-DeWitt detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that the Unruh effect completely destroys quantum entanglement and coherence of bipartite states, as modeled by entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors. But does the Unruh effect have a different impact on quantum entanglement of multipartite states within this framework? In this paper, we investigate the influence of the Unruh effect on 1-3 entanglement in the context of entangled tetra-partite Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We find that quantum entanglement of tetrapartite W state first decreases to a minimum value and then increases to a fixed value with the growth of the acceleration. This indicates that the Unruh effect can, under certain conditions, enhance quantum entanglement. In other words, the Unruh effect plays a dual role in the behavior of quantum entanglement-both diminishing and enhancing it. This discovery challenges and overturns the traditional view that the Unruh effect is solely detrimental to quantum entanglement and coherence in entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors, offering a fresh and profound perspective on its impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tunneling process of massive scalar particles from a quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole using the tunneling approach proposed by Parikh and Wilczek. We compute the emission rate of these tunneling particles, which includes quantum correction terms compared to the result in classical General Relativity. These correction terms arise from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the scheme outlined in [1, 2], we derive the entropy of the black hole. Consistent with the universal black hole entropy formula in the context of quantum gravity, our findings include a logarithmic correction.</description>

Abstract: Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) enable us to measure time and frequency with a fractional uncertainty at $10^{-18}$ level, which is 2 orders of magnitude better than Cs clocks. In this article, after briefly reviewing OLCs and the history of testing the fundamental principles of general relativity, we report our experiments of measuring the gravitational redshift between RIKEN and The University of Tokyo, and at Tokyo Skytree using transportable OLCs. We also discuss a couple of future applications of OLCs, such as detecting gravitational waves in space and relativistic geodesy. The possibility of testing second-order parametrized post-Newtonian potential around the Earth is also mentioned.</description>

      <title>Consistency Problems of Conformal Killing Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems in the sense that integration constants in the solutions, such as the parameter $m$ in the Schwarzschild metric, do not allow for an interpretation in terms of conserved quantities in the theory. The recently introduced Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity that inherits all the solutions of the latter, and defined with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive study of gravitational lensing by dark compact objects predicted by a Modified Gravity (MOG) based on the Scalar-Vector-Tensor action, and the aim is to analyze new insights into the nature of gravitational interactions. We compute weak and strong deflection angles for the specified static, spherically symmetric MOG spacetime. Additionally, we dedicate a section to explore observational implications in the weak field limit. By employing a supermassive galactic black hole as a gravitational lens, we compare various parameters in MOG with those of the Schwarzschild black hole as lens in strong-field scenarios. Specifically, we model the black holes M87${^*}$ and Sgr A${^*}$ as lenses within the MOG framework, calculating the corresponding lensing coefficients and distortion parameters in the weak field regime.</description>

      <title>Investigating the shadows of new regular black holes with a Minkowski core: Effects of spherical accretion and core type differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shadows and optical appearances of a new type of regular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core under different spherical accretion. These BHs are constructed by modifying the Newtonian potential based on the minimum observable length in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). They correspond one-to-one with the traditional regular BHs with a de-Sitter (dS) core (such as Bardeen/Hayward BHs), characterized by quantum gravity effect parameter ($\alpha_0$) and spacetime deformation factor ($n$). We find that the characteristic parameters give rise to some novel observable features. For these new BHs, the shadow radius, photon sphere radius, and total observed intensity increase with the increase of $\alpha_0$ but decrease with the increase of $n$. Under different spherical accretion, the shadow and photon sphere radius are identical, but the total observed intensity under the static spherical accretion is greater than that under the infalling spherical accretion. In addition, we find that these regular BHs with different cores show differences in shadows and optical appearances, especially under the static spherical accretion. Compared with Bardeen BH, the new BH has a smaller total observed intensity, dimmer maximum luminosity, and smaller shadow and photon sphere radius. The larger $\alpha_0$ leads to more significant differences, and a similar trend is also seen in the comparison with Hayward BH. Under the infalling spherical accretion, these regular BHs with different cores only have slight differences in total observed intensity, shadow and photon sphere radius, which become more obvious when $\alpha_0$ is relatively large. It suggests that the unique spacetime features of these regular BHs with different cores can be distinguished through astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by re-examining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

      <title>Looking To The Horizon: Probing Evolution in the Black Hole Spectrum With GW Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of black holes observed via gravitational waves currently covers the local universe up to a redshift $z\lesssim 1$, for the most massive merging binaries, or $z\lesssim 0.25$ for low-mass BH binaries (BBH). Evolution of the BBH mass spectrum over cosmic time will be a significant probe of formation channels and environments. We demonstrate a reconstruction of the BBH merger rate, allowing for general dependence on binary masses and luminosity distance or redshift and accounting for selection effects, via iterative kernel density estimation (KDE) with optimized multidimensional bandwidths. Performing such reconstructions under a range of detailed assumptions, we see no significant evidence for the evolution of BBH masses with redshift, over the range where detected events are available; at most, a possible trend towards increasing merger rate with redshift for primary masses $m_1\gtrsim 50\,M_\odot$ is supported. We compare these findings with previous investigations and caution against over-interpreting the current, sparse, data. Significantly upgraded detectors and/or facilities, and longer observing times, are required to harness any correlations of the BBH mass distribution with redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the background and perturbations in two classes of $k$-inflation models with the potential characterized by an inflection point. We demonstrate that these models enjoy scaling properties which could be used to redefine input parameters so that the perturbations spectra satisfy correct normalization at the CMB pivot scale. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models.</description>

      <title>Larmor radiation as a witness to the Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the emission of radiation from general sources in quantum scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields using the Rindler coordinate frame, which is suitable for a uniformly accelerated observer, in the Minkowski vacuum. In particular, we point out that, to recover the usual Larmor radiation in the interaction picture, it is necessary to incorporate the Unruh effect. Thus, the observation of classical Larmor radiation could be seen as vindicating the Unruh effect in the sense that it is not correctly reproduced in this context unless the Unruh effect is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Bunch-Davies initial conditions and non-perturbative inflationary dynamics in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using numerical relativity. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies vaccuum and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study neutrino spin oscillations in the case when they are gravitationally scattered off a rotating Kerr black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. We consider only toroidal magnetic field inside the disk. Neutrino spin precession is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. Our treatment of the spin oscillations of the observed neutrino fluxes is based on numerical simulations of the propagation of a large number of incoming test neutrinos using High Performance Parallel Computing. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 2. Code &amp; Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to utilize the observed ratio of spherically-averaged distance to the sound horizon scale from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data to test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the luminosity distances (LDs) obtained from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations with angular diameter distances (ADDs) derived from these ratio measurements, using a cosmological-model-independent method. To match the LDs with the ADDs at the identical redshifts, we employ two methods: a compressed form of the Pantheon sample and a hybrid approach that combines the binning method with an artificial neural network (ANN). The Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at any redshift is reconstructed from the observed Hubble parameter data with the ANN to derive the ADD. To avoid potential biases resulted from the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ of SNIa and the sound horizon scale $r_{\rm d}$ from BAO measurements, we introduce the fiducial parameter $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\, r_{\rm d}^{3 \over 2} $ and marginalize their impacts by treating them as nuisance parameters with flat prior distributions in our statistical analysis. Subsequently, we update the measurements of ratio of the transverse comoving distance to the sound horizon scale from the latest BAO data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration for CDDR testing. Our results indicate that BAO observation provides a powerful tool for testing the CDDR, independent of both the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ and sound horizon scale $r_{\rm d}$, as well as any cosmological model.</description>

      <title>The Equation of State of Neutron Stars: Theoretical Models, Observational Constraints, and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Cosmological cutting rules for Bogoliubov initial states: any mass and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological optical theorem and the cutting rules are well-known consequences of unitary time evolution in cosmology. The earlier works showed that assuming a Bunch-Davies initial state, one can derive equations relating a wavefunction diagram with a given number of internal lines to a sum of diagrams with fewer internal lines. In particular, it can relate a loop diagram to a sum of tree-level diagrams. Recently these relations were generalised to a set of excited initial states known as Bogoliubov states and they were shown to have non-trivial consequences for n-point contact and 4-point exchange diagrams. This analysis restricted the field content to massless and conformally coupled scalar fields. In this paper, we take the final step of generalising these "Bogoliubov cutting rules" to fields of any mass and spin. We define modified propagator identities and corresponding "Discontinuities" which automatically generalise the earlier relations to fields of any mass and spin. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the far past convergence of time integrals in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first example of interacting quantized Carrollian Dirac fermions and investigate their discrete symmetries, including charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) transformations. As a toy model, we couple these fermions to a Carrollian scalar field using Carrollian Yukawa theory and compute the tree-level diagram, revealing an ultralocal interaction between the Carrollian fermions and the scalar field. This interaction, widely known as a Dirac delta interaction with time-dependent factor, frequently appears in quantum physics. We then address the renormalization of the theory by employing the Wilsonian procedure at one-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the fixed points and stability properties of Carrollian Yukawa theory, comparing them with their relativistic counterparts. Beyond the specific Yukawa model studied here, we expect that our framework will have broader applications in Carrollian physics, particularly in understanding ultralocal interactions and their role in condensed matter systems, where similar phenomena arise in strongly correlated and non-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Transition between Schwarzschild black hole and string black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the quantum transition between a Schwarzschild black hole and a string black hole in the large $D$ limit. Classically, such a transition between these two distinct black hole geometries is forbidden. The only feasible discussion is centered on how a black hole evaporates, loses mass, and transitions into highly excited fundamental strings. Building upon our previous work on T-duality between the Schwarzschild and string black holes, we reduce the problem to two dimensions, where the corresponding Wheeler-De Witt equation can be derived. Using this equation, we identify the two black hole geometries as distinct wave function states. This allows us to easily compute the transition probability between these two geometries, driven by the string coupling.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Galvano-rotational effect induced by electroweak interactions in pulsars"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this comment, we obtain the corrected energy spectrum for Dvornikov's paper, that is, a spectrum in which the matter term, given by $V_L$, is ''tied'' in both the radial and angular quantum numbers, given by $N$ and $J_z$. In particular, the error committed by Dvornikov arose from an incorrectly solved second-order differential equation. Besides, such an equation also had another error, i.e. since Dvornikov considered ultrarelativistic particles where $m\to 0$, it implies that all terms of this equation containing $m$ should vanish; however, that is not what happened. Therefore, solving in detail the corrected Dvornikov equation, we obtain the corrected spectrum, where we verified that for $J_z&gt;0$ (positive angular momentum), $\sigma=+1$ (upper component of the spinor) and $V_L&gt;0$, or $J_z&lt;0$ (negative angular momentum), $\sigma=-1$ (lower component of the spinor) and $V_L&lt;0$, we recover the particular spectrum of Dvornikov's paper with $m^2=0$ (as it should be).</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory from Accelerating Relativistic Jets in Multiple Thick Shell Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) memory, a permanent distortion of the space-time metric, is anticipated during the acceleration of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). While the precise mechanism behind GRBs is not yet fully understood, detecting GW memory may contribute to clarifying their nature. In this paper, we consider various scenarios of GW memory emission, including both single and multiple shells with thin- and thick-shells. In particular, the memory spectrum for each scenario is compared with the sensitivity of next-generation detectors, namely DECIGO and ET-D. Physical properties spread over a broad-band region, emphasizing the importance of combined and wide-band observations. We also simulate GW memory based on nearby, realistic scenarios and demonstrate its detectability.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral through Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research.
  First, we have developed a novel 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through the emission of photons.
  Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ${\sim\!200}$ orbits starting from a separation of ${20\,r_g}$ and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have identified how and when the minidisks dissolve as the binary compresses. We also show that even when the binary ``decouples'' from its surrounding disk, its luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few and abruptly increases by ${\sim\!50\%}$ at the time of merger, accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, the magnetic flux brought to the spin-parameter ${\sim\!0.68}$ merger remnant is able to drive a relativistic, Poynting-flux-dominated jet.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Quantum-Limited Gravitational-Wave Detection Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the potential of new adaptive optical technology to expand the detection horizon of gravitational-wave observatories. Achieving greater quantum-noise-limited sensitivity to spacetime strain hinges on achieving higher circulating laser power, in excess of 1~MW, in conjunction with highly-squeezed quantum states of light. The new technology will enable significantly higher levels of laser power and squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors, by providing high-precision, low-noise correction of limiting sources of thermal distortions directly to the core interferometer optics. In simulated projections for LIGO~A+, assuming an input laser power of 125~W and an effective injected squeezing level of 9~dB entering the interferometer, an initial concept of this technology can reduce the noise floor of the detectors by up to 20\% from 200~Hz to 5~kHz, corresponding to an increment of 4~Mpc in the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers. This work lays the foundation for one of the key technology improvements essential to fully utilize the scientific potential of the existing 4-km LIGO facilities, to observe black hole merger events past a redshift of~5, and opens a realistic pathway towards a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the United States, Cosmic~Explorer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum gravity fluctuations in a pair of nearby gravitational wave detectors. Quantum fluctuations of long-wavelength modes of the gravitational field induce coherent fluctuations in the detectors, leading to correlated noise. We determine the variance and covariance in the lengths of the arms of the detectors, and thereby obtain the graviton noise correlation. We find that the correlation depends on the angle between the detector arms as well as their separation distance. Using our result, we propose an experimental setup to detect this noise. The suggested interferometer configuration can be used to distinguish quantum-gravitational noise from both correlated and uncorrelated sources of background noise.</description>

      <title>Circular light orbits of a general, static, and spherical symmetrical wormhole with $Z_2$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07846v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the ring images or the shadow images of the centers of the galaxy M87 and the Milky way have been reported by Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. It is believed that the ring images imply that the central objects form unstable light circular orbits. Some of wormholes with $Z_2$ symmetry against a throat are wrongly excluded from the candidates at the centers of M87 and the Milky way due to the overlooking the unstable light circular orbits on the throat. A general asymptotically-flat, static, and spherical symmetrical wormhole without a thin shell has at least one unstable circular light orbit at the throat or elsewhere. If the wormhole has $Z_2$ symmetry against the throat, it has the unstable circular light orbits on the throat or it has stable circular light orbits on the throat and unstable ones near the throat. We need to analyze the throat carefully to make sure we do not unfairly rule out the $Z_2$-symmetrical wormholes. In this study, we categorize the numbers of the circular light orbits of the $Z_2$-symmetrical wormhole and their stability from the derivatives of an effective potential at the throat and we investigate the circular light orbits around a Simpson-Visser black-bounce spacetime, a Damour-Solodukhin wormhole spacetime, a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black-hole-like wormhole spacetime or a charged Damour-Solodukhin wormhole spacetime as examples. We give complete treatments including degenerated circular light orbits made from more than one stable and unstable circular light orbits on and off the throat.</description>

      <title>KG-oscillators in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Wu-Yang magnetic monopole and Ricci scalar curvature effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the bosonic Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a global monopole (GM) spacetime in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity and a Wu-Yang magnetic monopole (WYMM). We discuss the gravitational effects in the presence of Ricci scalar curvature $R=R_{\upsilon }^{\upsilon }$. It is observed that the presence of the Ricci scalar curvature, effectively and manifestly, introduces a force field that makes the corresponding quantum mechanical repulsive core more repulsive. Similar effect is also observed for the EiBI-gravitational field. We reiterate and report that the corresponding bosonic KG-oscillator quantum mechanical system admits a solution in the form of confluent Heun functions, the truncation of which into a physically admissible polynomial is shown to be associated with some parametric correlations/conditions. The use of such conditions/correlations is mandatory and yields a set of allowed/restricted quantum mechanical orbital $\ell $-excitations, for all radial quantum numbers $n_{r}\geq 0$. Our procedure is shown to be quite handy, in the since that it allows one to retrieve results for KG-oscillators in GM-spacetime in different EiBI-gravity and Ricci scalar curvature settings.</description>

      <title>Charged Quark Stars and Extreme Compact Objects in Regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\rightarrow 4$ limit for 4 dimensional Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations modified for charge and 4DEGB gravity, we model the stellar structure of charged, non-interacting quark stars. We find that increasing the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ or the charge $Q$ both tend to increase the mass-radius profiles of quark stars described by this theory, allowing a given central pressure to support larger quark stars in general. We also derive a generalization of the Buchdahl bound for charged stars in 4DEGB gravity. As in the uncharged case, we find that quark stars can exist below the general relativistic Buchdahl bound (BB) and Schwarzschild radius $R=2M$, due to the lack of a mass gap between black holes and compact stars in the 4DEGB theory. Even for $\alpha$ well within current observational constraints, we find that quark star solutions in this theory can describe Extreme Compact Charged Objects (ECCOs), objects whose radii are smaller than what is allowed by general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistical fluctuations (such as the variance) of causal set quantities, with particular focus on the causal set action. To facilitate calculating such fluctuations, we develop tools to account for correlations between causal intervals with different cardinalities. We present a convenient decomposition of the fluctuations of the causal set action into contributions that depend on different kinds of correlations. This decomposition can be used in causal sets approximated by any spacetime manifold $\mathcal M$. Our work paves the way for investigating a number of interesting discreteness effects, such as certain aspects of the Everpresent $\Lambda$ cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction through magnetic reconnection from a Kerr-Newman black hole in perfect fluid dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, a novel mechanism recently proposed by Comisso and Asenjo, for a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Our studies focus on the impact of black hole spin $a$, electric charge $Q$ and PFDM parameter $\lambda$ on the horizons, ergoregion and circular geodesics at the equatorial plane of this black hole, and how they further influence the reconnection efficiency and energy extraction rate. Our results show that the outer horizon and the size of ergoregion do not vary monotonically with increasing dark matter parameters $\lambda$ until reaching its critical value $\lambda_c$ due to the combined counteracting effect between the black hole's charge and dark matter parameter. We identify the optimal combinations of $a$, $Q$ and $\lambda$ that allow for efficient energy extraction and high extracted power, even when the black hole is not spinning near its extremal limit. Our results ease the stringent conditions observed in other rotating black holes, where achieving comparable levels of extracted power and reconnection efficiency typically requires a near-extremal spin.</description>

      <title>Violations of energy conservation in Horava-Lifshitz gravity: a new ingredient in the dark matter puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity and more general theories where the local Hamiltonian constraint is lost, for example due to the time variability of the Lagrangian (e.g. via its parameters) where time is defined on a foliation according to a prescription mimicking Lambda and 4-volume time in unimodualr gravity. In one direction we subject the multitude of parameters in HL to this variability game, mimicking RG flow in a cosmological setting. In the opposite direction, we examine the evolution on the left-over Hamiltonian should the HL algebra of constraints be still applicable, rather than the algebra of General Relativity being restored. Within the projectable theory, the non-vanishing Hamiltonian can be reinterpreted as a pressureless fluid, resulting in essentially the same phenomenologies at macroscopic scales as in the standard cold dark matter paradigm. At high energies and short distances, however, unlike in theories with similar variability based on GR, violations of stress-energy tensor conservation persist, and these are computed here for the full class of projectable HL models. The phenomenological implications are examined: remarkably the driven solution resulting from these energy conservation violations is shown to be the attractor of the system during a free-fall collapse as far as the backreaction is negligible. When the backreaction is taken into account, the driven solution is expected to play an important role towards our understanding of microscopic caustic avoidance, which is one of the most significant issues in many alternatives to particle dark matter scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing by Bardeen black hole in cloud of strings (CoS) in strong field limit. The effect of CoS parameter $b$ has been outlined in comparison with Bardeen black hole lens. The strong deflection limit coefficients are determined in terms of impact parameter for various values of CoS parameter. We obtain magnification of relativistic images and determine relativistic Einstein rings by using the parameters of two astrophysical black hole lenses $SgrA^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$.

Abstract: The groundwork for the theory of dark matter superfluidity has already been laid. The dynamics of the theory are determined from the non-relativistic P(X) superfluid Lagrangian density which models MOND phenomenology when coupled to baryons on galactic scale. The same Lagrangian reduces to {\Lambda}CDM on cosmological scale at zeroth order. This suggests that cold dark matter undergo Bose-Einstein condensation in galaxies. In this paper, we extend the non-relativistic theory to include the relativistic corrections within the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. We also explore how matter perturbations grow in the weak-field limit of the relativistic theory proposed in [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the gravitational lensing of light or gravitational waves by Schwarzschild black hole in geometric optics. Instead of a single massless particle, we investigate the collective behavior of a congruence of light/gravitational rays, described by the geodesic deviation equation (GDE). By projecting on the Newman-Penrose tetrad, GDE is decoupled, and we find an analytical Dyson-like series solution in the weak deflection and thin lens limits. Based on such a solution, we study the evolution of cross-sectional area and axis ratio. Finally, we reproduce the magnification and axis ratio of the lensing images up to the second order of weak deflection approximation and improve some missing corrections in previous works.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Kiselev-AdS Black Holes within f (R, T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological charge and the conditions for the existence of the photon sphere (PS) in Kiselev-AdS black holes within \(f(R, T)\) gravity. We employ two different methods based on Duan's topological current \(\phi\)-mapping theory viz analize of temperature and the generalized Helmholtz free energy methods to study the topological classes of our black hole. By considering the mentioned black hole, we discuss the critical and zero points (topological charges and topological numbers) for different parameters. Our findings reveal that the Kiselev parameter \(\omega\) and the \(f(R, T)\) gravity parameter \(\gamma\) influence the number of topological charges of black holes, leading to novel insights into topological classifications. We observe that for given values of the free parameters, there exist total topological charges (\(Q_{total} = -1\)) for T-method and total topological numbers (\(W = +1\)) for the generalized Helmholtz free energy method. Our research findings elucidate that, in contrast to the scenario where \(\omega = 1/3\), in other cases, increasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of total topological charges for the black hole. Interestingly, for the phantom field (\(\omega = -4/3\)), we observed that decreasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of topological charges. Additionally, we study the results for the photon sphere. The studied models clearly reveal that the simultaneous presence of \(\gamma\) and \(\omega\) effectively expands the permissible range for \(\gamma\). In other words, the model can exhibit black hole behavior over a larger domain. Additionally, it is evident that with the stepwise reduction of \(\omega\), the region covered by singularity also diminishes and becomes more restricted. However, An interesting point about all three ranges is the elimination of the forbidden region in this model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Euler-Heisenberg Black Hole Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitating lensing Euler-Heisenberg black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. This kind of black hole solution enables us to investigate the nontrivial interplay between the dark matter effects and nonlinear electrodynamics effects (or quantum electrodynamics effects) on charged black hole systems. The important observables in gravitational lensings are calculated and discussed in our work, including the gravitational deflection angle of light, time delay of light, precession angle of massive orbit's bound orbits, and black hole shadow radius. The results indicates that the Euler-Heisenberg black hole with a larger perfect fluid dark matter parameter could greatly reduce the gravitational deflection angle of light, time delay of light and precession angle of massive object's bound orbit, while the nonlinear electrodynamics effects do not have large influences on these gravitational lensing observables.

      <title>Effects of orbital eccentricity on continuous gravitational waveforms from triaxially deformed precessing neutron stars in tight binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The successful detection of continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars (NSs) will shape our understanding of the physical properties of dense matter under extreme conditions. Binary population synthesis simulations show that forthcoming space-borne gravitational wave detectors may be capable of detecting some tight Galactic double NSs with 10-min orbital periods. Successfully searching for continuous waves from the individual NS in such a close binary demands extremely precise waveform templates considering the interaction between the NS and its companion. Unlike the isolated formation channel, double NS systems from the dynamical formation channel have moderate to high orbital eccentricities. To accommodate these systems, we generalize the analytical waveforms from triaxial nonaligned NSs under spin-orbit coupling derived by Feng \textit{et al.} [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063035}{Phys. Rev. D 108, 063035 (2023)}] to incorporate the effects of the orbital eccentricity. Our findings suggest that for binaries formed through isolated binary evolution, the impact of eccentricity on the continuous waves of their NSs can be neglected. In contrast, for those formed through dynamical processes, it is necessary to consider eccentricity, as high-eccentricity orbits can result in a fitting factor of $\lesssim 0.97$ (0.9) within approximately 0.5 (1) to 2 (5) yr of a coherent search (at wave frequencies of 100 and 200 Hz). Once the continuous waves from spinning NSs in tight binaries are detected, the relative measurement accuracy of eccentricity can reach $\Delta e / e \sim O(10^{-7})$ for a signal-to-noise ratio of $O(100)$ based on the Fisher information matrix, bearing significant implications for understanding the formation mechanisms of double NS systems.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>DHOST theories as disformal gravity: From black holes to radiative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript reviews the construction of exact solutions describing both (rotating) black holes and non-linear radiative spacetimes in the context of degenerate higher order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We start be reviewing the structure of the DHOST theory space, the notion of degeneracy conditions and the stability of these degeneracy classes under disformal field redefinition (DFR). Then we discuss several key notions related to stationary and axi-symmetric black holes, and in particular the no-hair theorems derived in GR and in its scalar-tensor extensions. The rest of the chapters are devoted to the disformal solution generating map use to construct new hairy black holes solutions. A brief review of the rotating black holes solutions found so far in this context and a detailed description of the disformed Kerr black hole, we further comment on on-going efforts to construct rotating black hole solutions mimicking the closest the Kerr geometry. Then, we discuss how DFR affects the algebraic properties of a gravitational field and in particular its Petrov type. This provides a first systematic characterization of this effect, paving the road for constructing new solutions with a fixed Petrov type. Finally, we review more recent works aiming at characterizing the effect of a DFR on non-linear radiative geometries. We derive the general conditions for the generation of disformal tensorial gravitational wave and we study in detail a concrete example in DHOST gravity describing the new radiative effect induced by a time-dependent scalar monopoly in such higher-order theory. While most of the material presented here is a re-organized and augmented version of our published works, we have included new results and also new proposals to construct phenomenologically interesting solutions. This manuscript can be used as a review on the construction of exact solutions in DHOST gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Can Rotating Black Holes Have Short Hairs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the no-hair theorem, several notable hairy black hole (BH) solutions exist in both General Relativity and modified gravity theories. For such hairs to be detectable, they must extend sufficiently beyond the event horizon. This idea has been rigorously formalized by the no-short hair theorem, which dictates that all existing hairs of a static spherically symmetric BH must extend at least to the innermost light ring (LR). However, the theorem's applicability to the astrophysically relevant rotating BHs remains elusive as yet. To address this gap, we examine its validity for rotating BHs in the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko-Stuchl\'ik and Johannsen classes. Interestingly, for Klein-Gordon separable BHs in these classes that are solutions of non-vacuum GR, the no-short hair property continues to hold. However, unlike in static cases, this result may not apply in a theory-agnostic fashion due to the rotation-induced repulsive effects. Consequently, we identify a minimal set of additional criteria on the metric and matter content needed for such a generalization in other theories. Our study marks an important first step toward establishing general results on the extent of rotating BH hairs, reinforcing their observational detections. Further extension of this novel result for rotating horizonless objects is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we perform a dynamical systems study of the purely kinetic k-essence. Although these models have been studied in the past, a full study of the dynamics in the phase space incorporating the stability conditions for theoretical consistency is lacking. Our results confirm in a very rigorous and clear way that these models i) can not explain in a unified way the dark matter and dark energy components of the cosmic fluid and ii) are not adequate to explain the existing observational evidence, in particular the observed amount of cosmic structure.</description>

      <title>Herrera Complexity and Shadows of Spherically Symmetric Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of complexity factor on the formation of photon spheres for spherically symmetric compact objects. The complexity factor obtained from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann curvature tensor connects the geometric attributes of a compact spherically symmetric gravitating object with its matter inhomogeneity and pressure anisotropy via a scalar term. The novelty of the complexity factor is the inherent simple definition that identifies the evolution of matter tensors inside a given region of space-time. Such identification helps to obtain an equivalence class of gravitating compact objects based on their degree of complexity with zero complexity identified as the simplest system. On the other hand shadows and photon rings have become essential for identifying compact regions of space time characterised by massive gravity. Advanced observational data analysis tools augments the hope for identification of exotic gravitational objects, like the so called ``black hole mimickers" and may serve as testing ground for other gravity theories. In this context we explore how complexity of compact objects (a fundamentally theoretical classification) is connected to the photon ring (an astrophysical observable in the universe) and its stability. We consider zero complexity systems and discuss its significance with respect to (wrt) formation of photon rings and hence shadows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black bounce spacetimes usually arise from the Simpson-Visser regularization method. This type of metric presents a wormhole throat inside an event horizon. In this paper, we presented new classes of black bounce spacetime solutions, which have multiple horizons, throats, and anti-throats. These solutions are variants of black holes and wormholes, based on modifications of the Schwarzschild and Simpson-Visser metrics. The metric function allows for multiple horizons and throats, and the asymptotic behavior recovers the Schwarzschild solution. The article considers a scalar field coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, generating solutions with a partially phantom scalar field and a magnetic monopole. The energy conditions can be satisfied or violated depending on the region of spacetime, analyzed through an anisotropic fluid. The regularity of the spacetime is ensured by the analysis of the Kretschmann scalar.</description>

Abstract: Approximating the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking by the hyperbolic Scarf potential, the scattering of particles by a gravitational wave generated by flyby is described analytically by following the Nikiforov-Uvarov method applied to the Scarf potential.

      <description>arXiv:2401.12889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing observations using MeerKAT of the eccentric binary millisecond pulsar, PSR J0514$-$4002E, have unveiled a companion with a mass in the mass gap, ranging from $2.09\, M_\odot$ to $2.71\, M_\odot$. This challenges conventional astrophysical scenarios for black hole formation. In this paper, we present an alternative explanation: PSR J0514$-$4002E could be in a PBH-NS binary, with the companion potentially being a primordial black hole formed during the early Universe's first-order phase transition. The associated stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during this phase transition can account for the observed signal from the pulsar timing array, and the abundance of primordial black holes is consistent with constraints from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

Abstract: We present the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) simulation with a bubble universe scenario around a rotating black hole (BH) in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime to explain recently updated observations of light elements such as the primordial helium abundance. In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D-early Universe is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter expansion in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin parameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are important to resolve the ${}^4{\rm He}$ anomaly. The present results provide clues to finding a connection between the observed results of light-element nucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$ spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere can be rigid under smooth deformations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of a spiral galaxy derived from its rotation curve must account for the galaxy's past accretion history. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Viscous Hydrodynamics in the Density Frame: Numerical Tests and Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical study of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics in the Density Frame for one-dimensional fluid flows. The Density Frame is a formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics that is first-order in time, requires no auxiliary fields, and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. We compare our results to QCD kinetic theory simulations and find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics. Additionally, the Density Frame results remain well-behaved and robust near the boundary of applicability. We also compare our findings to the second-order-in-time hydrodynamic theory developed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) and a well-known M\"uller-Israel-Stewart-type hydrodynamics code, MUSIC, which is commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Using SimTeEx to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computations with tensors are ubiquitous in fundamental physics, and so is the usage of Einstein's dummy index convention for the contraction of indices. For instance, $T_{ia}U_{aj}$ is readily recognized as the same as $T_{ib}U_{bj}$, but a computer does not know that T[i,a]U[a,j] is equal to T[i,b]U[b,j]. Furthermore, tensors may have symmetries which can be used to simply expressions: if $U_{ij}$ is antisymmetric, then $\alpha T_{ia}U_{aj}+\beta T_{ib}U_{jb}=\left(\alpha-\beta\right)T_{ia}U_{aj}$. The fact that tensors can have elaborate symmetries, together with the problem of dummy indices, makes it complicated to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors. In this work I will present an algorithm for doing so, which was implemented in the Mathematica package SimTeEx (Simplify Tensor Expressions). It can handle any kind of tensor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multi-axion like description of the dark sector in light of the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.</description>

      <title>Perturbative soft graviton theorems in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion assuming a small cosmological constant, we compute the leading and subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in Bhatkar, Jain[J. High Energ Phys.55 (2023)] for the soft photons.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>
