      <title>SPARKLE: Enhancing SPARQL Generation with Direct KG Integration in Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing KBQA methods have traditionally relied on multi-stage methodologies, involving tasks such as entity linking, subgraph retrieval and query structure generation. However, multi-stage approaches are dependent on the accuracy of preceding steps, leading to cascading errors and increased inference time. Although a few studies have explored the use of end-to-end models, they often suffer from lower accuracy and generate inoperative query that is not supported by the underlying data. Furthermore, most prior approaches are limited to the static training data, potentially overlooking the evolving nature of knowledge bases over time. To address these challenges, we present a novel end-to-end natural language to SPARQL framework, SPARKLE. Notably SPARKLE leverages the structure of knowledge base directly during the decoding, effectively integrating knowledge into the query generation. Our study reveals that simply referencing knowledge base during inference significantly reduces the occurrence of inexecutable query generations. SPARKLE achieves new state-of-the-art results on SimpleQuestions-Wiki and highest F1 score on LCQuAD 1.0 (among models not using gold entities), while getting slightly lower result on the WebQSP dataset. Finally, we demonstrate SPARKLE's fast inference speed and its ability to adapt when the knowledge base differs between the training and inference stages.</description>

      <title>Potential Renovation of Information Search Process with the Power of Large Language Model for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the development of the Six Stages of Information Search Model and its enhancement through the application of the Large Language Model (LLM) powered Information Search Processes (ISP) in healthcare. The Six Stages Model, a foundational framework in information science, outlines the sequential phases individuals undergo during information seeking: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation. Integrating LLM technology into this model significantly optimizes each stage, particularly in healthcare. LLMs enhance query interpretation, streamline information retrieval from complex medical databases, and provide contextually relevant responses, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of medical information searches. This fusion not only aids healthcare professionals in accessing critical data swiftly but also empowers patients with reliable and personalized health information, fostering a more informed and effective healthcare environment.</description>

      <title>A survey on the impact of AI-based recommenders on human behaviours: methodologies, outcomes and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems and assistants (in short, recommenders) are ubiquitous in online platforms and influence most actions of our day-to-day lives, suggesting items or providing solutions based on users' preferences or requests. This survey analyses the impact of recommenders in four human-AI ecosystems: social media, online retail, urban mapping and generative AI ecosystems. Its scope is to systematise a fast-growing field in which terminologies employed to classify methodologies and outcomes are fragmented and unsystematic. We follow the customary steps of qualitative systematic review, gathering 144 articles from different disciplines to develop a parsimonious taxonomy of: methodologies employed (empirical, simulation, observational, controlled), outcomes observed (concentration, model collapse, diversity, echo chamber, filter bubble, inequality, polarisation, radicalisation, volume), and their level of analysis (individual, item, model, and systemic). We systematically discuss all findings of our survey substantively and methodologically, highlighting also potential avenues for future research. This survey is addressed to scholars and practitioners interested in different human-AI ecosystems, policymakers and institutional stakeholders who want to understand better the measurable outcomes of recommenders, and tech companies who wish to obtain a systematic view of the impact of their recommenders.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Retrieval Algorithms in Ad and Content Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey examines the most effective retrieval algorithms utilized in ad recommendation and content recommendation systems. Ad targeting algorithms rely on detailed user profiles and behavioral data to deliver personalized advertisements, thereby driving revenue through targeted placements. Conversely, organic retrieval systems aim to improve user experience by recommending content that matches user preferences. This paper compares these two applications and explains the most effective methods employed in each.</description>

      <title>MeMemo: On-device Retrieval Augmentation for Private and Personalized Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented text generation (RAG) addresses the common limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucination, by retrieving information from an updatable external knowledge base. However, existing approaches often require dedicated backend servers for data storage and retrieval, thereby limiting their applicability in use cases that require strict data privacy, such as personal finance, education, and medicine. To address the pressing need for client-side dense retrieval, we introduce MeMemo, the first open-source JavaScript toolkit that adapts the state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor search technique HNSW to browser environments. Developed with modern and native Web technologies, such as IndexedDB and Web Workers, our toolkit leverages client-side hardware capabilities to enable researchers and developers to efficiently search through millions of high-dimensional vectors in the browser. MeMemo enables exciting new design and research opportunities, such as private and personalized content creation and interactive prototyping, as demonstrated in our example application RAG Playground. Reflecting on our work, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for on-device dense retrieval. MeMemo is available at https://github.com/poloclub/mememo.</description>

      <title>Reliable Confidence Intervals for Information Retrieval Evaluation Using Generative A.I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -- specifically large language models (LLMs) -- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs. Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications. However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.
  In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics. Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations. Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees. Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document. Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug safety research is crucial for maintaining public health, often requiring comprehensive data support. However, the resources currently available to the public are limited and fail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between drugs and their side effects. This paper introduces DrugWatch, an easy-to-use and interactive multi-source information visualisation platform for drug safety study. It allows users to understand common side effects of drugs and their statistical information, flexibly retrieve relevant medical reports, or annotate their own medical texts with our automated annotation tool. Supported by NLP technology and enriched with interactive visual components, we are committed to providing researchers and practitioners with a one-stop information analysis, retrieval, and annotation service. The demonstration video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTqDgxzETjw. We also deployed an online demonstration system at https://drugwatch.net/.</description>

      <title>Multi-Epoch learning with Data Augmentation for Deep Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the one-epoch overfitting phenomenon in Click-Through Rate (CTR) models, where performance notably declines at the start of the second epoch. Despite extensive research, the efficacy of multi-epoch training over the conventional one-epoch approach remains unclear. We identify the overfitting of the embedding layer, caused by high-dimensional data sparsity, as the primary issue. To address this, we introduce a novel and simple Multi-Epoch learning with Data Augmentation (MEDA) framework, suitable for both non-continual and continual learning scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing deep CTR models and may have potential applications to handle the "forgetting or overfitting" dilemma in the retraining and the well-known catastrophic forgetting problems. MEDA minimizes overfitting by reducing the dependency of the embedding layer on subsequent training data or the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, and achieves data augmentation through training the MLP with varied embedding spaces. Our findings confirm that pre-trained MLP layers can adapt to new embedding spaces, enhancing performance without overfitting. This adaptability underscores the MLP layers' role in learning a matching function focused on the relative relationships among embeddings rather than their absolute positions. To our knowledge, MEDA represents the first multi-epoch training strategy tailored for deep CTR prediction models. We conduct extensive experiments on several public and business datasets, and the effectiveness of data augmentation and superiority over conventional single-epoch training are fully demonstrated. Besides, MEDA has exhibited significant benefits in a real-world online advertising system.</description>

      <title>Investigating Nudges toward Related Sellers on E-commerce Marketplaces: A Case Study on Amazon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-commerce marketplaces provide business opportunities to millions of sellers worldwide. Some of these sellers have special relationships with the marketplace by virtue of using their subsidiary services (e.g., fulfillment and/or shipping services provided by the marketplace) -- we refer to such sellers collectively as Related Sellers. When multiple sellers offer to sell the same product, the marketplace helps a customer in selecting an offer (by a seller) through (a) a default offer selection algorithm, (b) showing features about each of the offers and the corresponding sellers (price, seller performance metrics, seller's number of ratings etc.), and (c) finally evaluating the sellers along these features. In this paper, we perform an end-to-end investigation into how the above apparatus can nudge customers toward the Related Sellers on Amazon's four different marketplaces in India, USA, Germany and France. We find that given explicit choices, customers' preferred offers and algorithmically selected offers can be significantly different. We highlight that Amazon is adopting different performance metric evaluation policies for different sellers, potentially benefiting Related Sellers. For instance, such policies result in notable discrepancy between the actual performance metric and the presented performance metric of Related Sellers. We further observe that among the seller-centric features visible to customers, sellers' number of ratings influences their decisions the most, yet it may not reflect the true quality of service by the seller, rather reflecting the scale at which the seller operates, thereby implicitly steering customers toward larger Related Sellers. Moreover, when customers are shown the rectified metrics for the different sellers, their preference toward Related Sellers is almost halved.</description>

      <title>LogEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Large Language Models In Log Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for ensuring the orderly and stable operation of information systems, particularly in the field of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing tasks. In the AIOps domain, they excel in tasks such as anomaly detection, root cause analysis of faults, operations and maintenance script generation, and alert information summarization. However, the performance of current LLMs in log analysis tasks remains inadequately validated. To address this gap, we introduce LogEval, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in various log analysis tasks for the first time. This benchmark covers tasks such as log parsing, log anomaly detection, log fault diagnosis, and log summarization. LogEval evaluates each task using 4,000 publicly available log data entries and employs 15 different prompts for each task to ensure a thorough and fair assessment. By rigorously evaluating leading LLMs, we demonstrate the impact of various LLM technologies on log analysis performance, focusing on aspects such as self-consistency and few-shot contextual learning. We also discuss findings related to model quantification, Chinese-English question-answering evaluation, and prompt engineering. These findings provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in multilingual environments and the effectiveness of different prompt strategies. Various evaluation methods are employed for different tasks to accurately measure the performance of LLMs in log analysis, ensuring a comprehensive assessment. The insights gained from LogEvals evaluation reveal the strengths and limitations of LLMs in log analysis tasks, providing valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>AdaCQR: Enhancing Query Reformulation for Conversational Search via Sparse and Dense Retrieval Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) has significantly advanced in addressing the challenges of conversational search, particularly those stemming from the latent user intent and the need for historical context. Recent works aimed to boost the performance of CRQ through alignment. However, they are designed for one specific retrieval system, which potentially results in poor generalization. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework AdaCQR. By aligning reformulation models with both term-based and semantic-based retrieval systems, AdaCQR enhances the generalizability of information-seeking queries across diverse retrieval environments through a dual-phase training strategy. We also developed two effective approaches for acquiring superior labels and diverse input candidates, boosting the efficiency and robustness of the framework. Experimental evaluations on the TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that AdaCQR significantly outperforms existing methods, offering both quantitative and qualitative improvements in conversational query reformulation.</description>

      <title>Simple Augmentations of Logical Rules for Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality and high-coverage rule sets are imperative to the success of Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion (NS-KGC) models, because they form the basis of all symbolic inferences. Recent literature builds neural models for generating rule sets, however, preliminary experiments show that they struggle with maintaining high coverage. In this work, we suggest three simple augmentations to existing rule sets: (1) transforming rules to their abductive forms, (2) generating equivalent rules that use inverse forms of constituent relations and (3) random walks that propose new rules. Finally, we prune potentially low quality rules. Experiments over four datasets and five ruleset-baseline settings suggest that these simple augmentations consistently improve results, and obtain up to 7.1 pt MRR and 8.5 pt Hits@1 gains over using rules without augmentations.</description>

      <title>Why does in-context learning fail sometimes? Evaluating in-context learning on open and closed questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the performance of in-context learning as a function of task novelty and difficulty for open and closed questions. For that purpose, we created a novel benchmark consisting of hard scientific questions, each paired with a context of various relevancy. We show that counter-intuitively, a context that is more aligned with the topic does not always help more than a less relevant context. This effect is especially visible for open questions and questions of high difficulty or novelty. This result reveals a fundamental difference between the treatment of close-form and open-form questions by large-language models and shows a need for a more robust evaluation of in-context learning on the variety of different types of questions. It also poses a new question of how to optimally select a context for large language models, especially in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our results suggest that the answer to this question can be highly application-dependent and might be contingent on factors including the format of the question, the perceived difficulty level of the questions, and the novelty or popularity of the information we seek.</description>

      <title>Joint-Dataset Learning and Cross-Consistent Regularization for Text-to-Motion Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pose-estimation methods enable extracting human motion from common videos in the structured form of 3D skeleton sequences. Despite great application opportunities, effective content-based access to such spatio-temporal motion data is a challenging problem. In this paper, we focus on the recently introduced text-motion retrieval tasks, which aim to search for database motions that are the most relevant to a specified natural-language textual description (text-to-motion) and vice-versa (motion-to-text). Despite recent efforts to explore these promising avenues, a primary challenge remains the insufficient data available to train robust text-motion models effectively. To address this issue, we propose to investigate joint-dataset learning - where we train on multiple text-motion datasets simultaneously - together with the introduction of a Cross-Consistent Contrastive Loss function (CCCL), which regularizes the learned text-motion common space by imposing uni-modal constraints that augment the representation ability of the trained network. To learn a proper motion representation, we also introduce a transformer-based motion encoder, called MoT++, which employs spatio-temporal attention to process sequences of skeleton data. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approaches on the widely-used KIT Motion-Language and HumanML3D datasets. We perform detailed experimentation on joint-dataset learning and cross-dataset scenarios, showing the effectiveness of each introduced module in a carefully conducted ablation study and, in turn, pointing out the limitations of state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Training Music Taggers on Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most contemporary music tagging systems rely on large volumes of annotated data. As an alternative, we investigate the extent to which synthetically generated music excerpts can improve tagging systems when only small annotated collections are available. To this end, we release GTZAN-synth, a synthetic dataset that follows the taxonomy of the well-known GTZAN dataset while being ten times larger in data volume. We first observe that simply adding this synthetic dataset to the training split of GTZAN does not result into performance improvements. We then proceed to investigating domain adaptation, transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies for the task at hand and draw the conclusion that the last two options yield an increase in accuracy. Overall, the proposed approach can be considered as a first guide in a promising field for future research.</description>

      <title>RankRAG: Unifying Context Ranking with Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically utilize the top-k contexts from a retriever in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this work, we propose a novel instruction fine-tuning framework RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for the dual purpose of context ranking and answer generation in RAG. In particular, the instruction-tuned LLMs work surprisingly well by adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend, and outperform existing expert ranking models, including the same LLM exclusively fine-tuned on a large amount of ranking data. For generation, we compare our model with many strong baselines, including GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-turbo-2024-0409, and ChatQA-1.5, an open-sourced model with the state-of-the-art performance on RAG benchmarks. Specifically, our Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks. In addition, it also performs comparably to GPT-4 on five RAG benchmarks in the biomedical domain without instruction fine-tuning on biomedical data, demonstrating its superb capability for generalization to new domains.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems help people find relevant content in a personalized way. One main promise of such systems is that they are able to increase the visibility of items in the long tail, i.e., the lesser-known items in a catalogue. Existing research, however, suggests that in many situations todays recommendation algorithms instead exhibit a popularity bias, meaning that they often focus on rather popular items in their recommendations. Such a bias may not only lead to the limited value of the recommendations for consumers and providers in the short run, but it may also cause undesired reinforcement effects over time. In this paper, we discuss the potential reasons for popularity bias and review existing approaches to detect, quantify and mitigate popularity bias in recommender systems. Our survey, therefore, includes both an overview of the computational metrics used in the literature as well as a review of the main technical approaches to reduce the bias. Furthermore, we critically discuss todays literature, where we observe that the research is almost entirely based on computational experiments and on certain assumptions regarding the practical effects of including long-tail items in the recommendations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Q&amp;A of Clinical Documents with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) house crucial patient data in clinical notes. As these notes grow in volume and complexity, manual extraction becomes challenging. This work introduces a natural language interface using large language models (LLMs) for dynamic question-answering on clinical notes. Our chatbot, powered by Langchain and transformer-based LLMs, allows users to query in natural language, receiving relevant answers from clinical notes. Experiments, utilizing various embedding models and advanced LLMs, show Wizard Vicuna's superior accuracy, albeit with high compute demands. Model optimization, including weight quantization, improves latency by approximately 48 times. Promising results indicate potential, yet challenges such as model hallucinations and limited diverse medical case evaluations remain. Addressing these gaps is crucial for unlocking the value in clinical notes and advancing AI-driven clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Cocktail: A Comprehensive Information Retrieval Benchmark with LLM-Generated Documents Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an influx of AI-generated content (AIGC) on the internet, transforming the corpus of Information Retrieval (IR) systems from solely human-written to a coexistence with LLM-generated content. The impact of this surge in AIGC on IR systems remains an open question, with the primary challenge being the lack of a dedicated benchmark for researchers. In this paper, we introduce Cocktail, a comprehensive benchmark tailored for evaluating IR models in this mixed-sourced data landscape of the LLM era. Cocktail consists of 16 diverse datasets with mixed human-written and LLM-generated corpora across various text retrieval tasks and domains. Additionally, to avoid the potential bias from previously included dataset information in LLMs, we also introduce an up-to-date dataset, named NQ-UTD, with queries derived from recent events. Through conducting over 1,000 experiments to assess state-of-the-art retrieval models against the benchmarked datasets in Cocktail, we uncover a clear trade-off between ranking performance and source bias in neural retrieval models, highlighting the necessity for a balanced approach in designing future IR systems. We hope Cocktail can serve as a foundational resource for IR research in the LLM era, with all data and code publicly available at \url{https://github.com/KID-22/Cocktail}.</description>

      <title>Light-weight End-to-End Graph Interest Network for CTR Prediction in E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction has an essential impact on improving user experience and revenue in e-commerce search. With the development of deep learning, graph-based methods are well exploited to utilize graph structure extracted from user behaviors and other information to help embedding learning. However, most of the previous graph-based methods mainly focus on recommendation scenarios, and therefore their graph structures highly depend on item's sequential information from user behaviors, ignoring query's sequential signal and query-item correlation. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Light-weight End-to-End Graph Interest Network (EGIN) to effectively mine users' search interests and tackle previous challenges. (i) EGIN utilizes query and item's correlation and sequential information from the search system to build a heterogeneous graph for better CTR prediction in e-commerce search. (ii) EGIN's graph embedding learning shares the same training input and is jointly trained with CTR prediction, making the end-to-end framework effortless to deploy in large-scale search systems. The proposed EGIN is composed of three parts: query-item heterogeneous graph, light-weight graph sampling, and multi-interest network. The query-item heterogeneous graph captures correlation and sequential information of query and item efficiently by the proposed light-weight graph sampling. The multi-interest network is well designed to utilize graph embedding to capture various similarity relationships between query and item to enhance the final CTR prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EGIN. At the same time, the training cost of graph learning is relatively low compared with the main CTR prediction task, ensuring efficiency in practical applications.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Alternative to Neural Representation Learning for Rating Prediction -- Transparent Latent Class Modeling of User Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural network (NN) and deep learning (DL) techniques are widely adopted in many applications, including recommender systems. Given the sparse and stochastic nature of collaborative filtering (CF) data, recent works have critically analyzed the effective improvement of neural-based approaches compared to simpler and often transparent algorithms for recommendation. Previous results showed that NN and DL models can be outperformed by traditional algorithms in many tasks. Moreover, given the largely black-box nature of neural-based methods, interpretable results are not naturally obtained. Following on this debate, we first present a transparent probabilistic model that topologically organizes user and product latent classes based on the review information. In contrast to popular neural techniques for representation learning, we readily obtain a statistical, visualization-friendly tool that can be easily inspected to understand user and product characteristics from a textual-based perspective. Then, given the limitations of common embedding techniques, we investigate the possibility of using the estimated interpretable quantities as model input for a rating prediction task. To contribute to the recent debates, we evaluate our results in terms of both capacity for interpretability and predictive performances in comparison with popular text-based neural approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed latent class representations can yield competitive predictive performances, compared to popular, but difficult-to-interpret approaches.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature. This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level differential privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates. The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications. We also introduce a novel Infinity-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice. We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions.</description>

      <title>ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Documents are visually rich structures that convey information through text, as well as tables, figures, page layouts, or fonts. While modern document retrieval systems exhibit strong performance on query-to-text matching, they struggle to exploit visual cues efficiently, hindering their performance on practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation. To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieving tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and settings. The inherent shortcomings of modern systems motivate the introduction of a new retrieval model architecture, ColPali, which leverages the document understanding capabilities of recent Vision Language Models to produce high-quality contextualized embeddings solely from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically faster and end-to-end trainable.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility in Machine Learning-based Research: Overview, Barriers and Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research in various fields is currently experiencing challenges regarding the reproducibility of results. This problem is also prevalent in machine learning (ML) research. The issue arises, for example, due to unpublished data and/or source code and the sensitivity of ML training conditions. Although different solutions have been proposed to address this issue, such as using ML platforms, the level of reproducibility in ML-driven research remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the reproducibility of ML-driven research with three main aims: (i) identifying the barriers to reproducibility when applying ML in research as well as categorize the barriers to different types of reproducibility (description, code, data, and experiment reproducibility), (ii) discussing potential drivers such as tools, practices, and interventions that support ML reproducibility, as well as distinguish between technology-driven drivers, procedural drivers, and drivers related to awareness and education, and (iii) mapping the drivers to the barriers. With this work, we hope to provide insights and to contribute to the decision-making process regarding the adoption of different solutions to support ML reproducibility.</description>
