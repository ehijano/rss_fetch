      <title>Astrometric microlensing probes of the isolated neutron star population with Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notoriously hard to detect and study, isolated neutron stars (NS) could provide valuable answers to fundamental questions about stellar evolution and explosion physics. With the upcoming Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2026, a new and powerful channel for their detection - astrometric microlensing - will become available. We set out to create a realistic sample of simulated gravitational microlensing events as observed by Roman with the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey. We focus in particular on the population of NS lenses, which has until now been largely understudied. We use state-of-the-art Galactic models tailored for application to microlensing by compact objects. We simulate four different NS populations with Maxwellian natal kick distributions: $\bar{v} = (150, \ 250, \ 350, \ 450)$ km/s. We apply projected Roman precision, cadence, and detectability criteria. We find the parameter space $\log_{10} t_{\rm E}$ - $\log_{10} \theta_{\rm E}$, which will be accessible to Roman observations, to be maximally efficient for classification of stellar remnants. We find a feature in this space that is characteristic to NS; using this feature, optimal samples of NS candidates can be constructed from Roman-like datasets. We describe the dependence of observable parameter distributions on the assumed mean kick velocities. As the effects of natal kicks are very complex and mutually counteracting, we suggest more detailed studies focused on the dynamics of NS are needed in anticipation of Roman and future surveys. We estimate Roman will observe approximately $11\,000$ microlensing events - including $\sim100$ with NS lenses - whose both photometric and astrometric signal are detectable; the event yield decreases by $38\%$ if gap-filling low-cadence observations are not included. We make all simulated microlensing event datasets publicly available in preparation for Roman data.</description>

      <title>POLAMI Multi-Wavelength Polarization Study of AGN Jets: A Millimeter-Optical Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-band polarimetry offers a powerful probe of AGN jets, accessing regions less affected by opacity and Faraday rotation than at longer radio wavelengths. As part of the POLAMI program, we have conducted 14 years of 1 mm and 3 mm polarization monitoring of a sample of gamma-ray-bright blazars with the IRAM 30-m telescope, complemented here with long-term optical polarimetric observations from multiple facilities. We aim to test whether current models of parsec-scale jet physics are consistent with observed multi-band polarization behavior. Using a Bayesian framework, we derive intrinsic mean flux densities and modulation indices for total flux and fractional polarization, and characterize EVPA variability using circular statistics. We then examine how these quantities reflecting variability properties across millimeter and optical bands relate to synchrotron peak frequency, jet orientation, and radio/gamma-ray luminosities. BL Lac objects exhibit, on average, higher fractional polarization and lower EVPA variability than FSRQs at all wavelengths. Fractional polarization increases with frequency, consistent with increasingly ordered magnetic fields at shorter wavelengths. BL Lacs also show more frequent alignment of EVPAs between optical and millimeter bands, whereas FSRQs display weaker coherence. EVPA variability correlates positively with radio and gamma-ray luminosities and negatively with synchrotron peak frequency, most strongly in the optical. We further find a positive correlation between EVPA spread and fractional polarization variability, suggesting a direct link between magnetic-field structure and polarization dynamics.</description>

      <title>From a Network to a Networking: The Evolution of the Latin American Giant Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is a collaborative initiative that deploys a network of low-cost, autonomous Water Cherenkov Detectors across Latin America and Spain. Initially focused on detecting gamma-ray bursts at high-altitude sites, LAGO has evolved into a multidisciplinary forum for astroparticle physics, space weather studies, and environmental monitoring. Its detectors operate from sea level to over 4300 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) in diverse geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. The ARTI-MEIGA simulation framework is a key development that models the entire cosmic-ray interaction chain, enabling site-specific simulations to be integrated into FAIR-compliant workflows. LAGO also plays a significant role in regional education and training through partnerships with ERASMUS+ projects, positioning itself as a hub for research capacity building. New contributions emerging from the collaboration include volcano muography, neutron hydrometry for precision agriculture, and space weather monitoring in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. LAGO demonstrates how Cherenkov-based detection and open science can drive scientific discovery and practical innovation.</description>

      <title>The Deeper, Wider, Faster programme's first DECam optical data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast ($&lt;$1$\,$hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of $g\sim22.2$ AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g&lt;22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.</description>

      <title>X-ray and radio observations of the AMXP MAXI J1957+032 covering the 2022-2025 outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented a comprehensive multi-epoch timing and multiwavelength analysis of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar MAXI J1957+032, covering two major outbursts in 2022 and 2025. By reanalyzing the 2022 outburst data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we found the spin frequency and orbital parameters from the observations in 0.3-5 keV. For the 2025 outburst, we reported the detection of pulsations with the Einstein Probe (EP). Based on the $\sim$3-year baseline between these two outbursts, we measured a significant long-term spin-down rate of $\dot\nu = (-5.73 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{-14}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Assuming that the quiescent spin-down is driven by magnetic dipole radiation, we inferred a spin-down luminosity of $L \approx 1.1 \times 10^{36}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and a surface dipolar magnetic field of $B \approx (7.3 - 10.4) \times 10^8$ G. Furthermore, we conducted a deep radio pulsation search with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during the X-ray quiescent state in 2024, resulting in a non-detection with a 7$\sigma$ flux density upper limit of 12.3 $\mu$Jy. This corresponds to a radio efficiency upper limit of $\xi &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{-10}$, which is significantly lower than that of typical millisecond pulsars with a similar spin-down power. This profound radio pulsation faintness can be explained by two primary scenarios: either a geometric effect, wherein the pulsar's radio beam is directed away from our line of sight, or a physical suppression of the emission mechanism, potentially caused by a persistent low-level accretion flow during the X-ray quiescent state.</description>

      <title>Radiative Cooling Effects on Plasmoid Formation in Black Hole Accretion Flows with Multiple Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We investigate the physics of black hole accretion flows, particularly focusing on phenomena like magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation, which are believed to be responsible for energetic events such as flares observed from astrophysical black holes.Aims. We aim to understand the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation within black hole accretion flows that are threaded by multi-loop magnetic field configurations.Methods. We conducted two- and three-dimensional two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. By varying the magnetic loop sizes and the mass accretion rate, we explored how radiative cooling alters the accretion dynamics, disk structure, and the properties of reconnection-driven plasmoid chains.Results. Our results demonstrate that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon. It significantly modifies the disk morphology by lowering the electron temperature and compressing the disk, which leads to increased density at the equatorial plane and decreased magnetization. Within the current sheets, radiative cooling triggers layer compression and the collapse of plasmoids, shortening their lifetime and reducing their size, while the frequency of plasmoid events increases. Moreover, we observe enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere, with its peaks corresponding to plasmoid presence.Conclusions. Radiative cooling plays a critical role in shaping both macroscopic accretion flow properties and microscopic reconnection phenomena near black holes. This suggests that radiative cooling may modulate black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes, highlighting its importance in models of astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Curvature Effect on the Speed of Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed of sound refers to the rate at which information travels from one point to another. It is a positive quantity and bounded by causality. It is defined as the rate of change of pressure with respect to the system's density. In this article, we derive a covariant equation for the sound wave and demonstrate how the wave equation is modified in the general relativistic formalism. One can then define an effective speed of sound by attenuating the usual definition of sound speed with the gravitational metric potential. The general relativistic curvature effect is observed to reduce the speed of sound when computed inside a neutron star. This effectively makes the star relatively softer (according to the equation of state). The change in the effective sound speed can be easily visualised if one redefines the non-radial modes in terms of it. The modes do not change, but the space-time curvature reduces the amplitude of the oscillation modes. The formalism is suited for studying astrophysical compact objects.</description>

      <title>An 11-Year Catalog of Gamma-Ray Transients: A Comprehensive Search with Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has produced the largest database of all-sky observations in gamma rays with its continuous data with high time and energy resolutions. These data contain a wealth of unidentified transient events that did not trigger the detectors for various reasons. We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known-event flagging as well as unknown-event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog. The event database with filtering capabilities is also publicly available at https://magnetars.sabanciuniv.edu/gbm, which allows users to retrieve event information based on their input queries along with the event lightcurves.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency evolution of the Integrated pulse profile of radio pulsars by implementing the inverse Compton mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Main Aim of this paper is to explain the emergence of new components of pulsars at higher radio bands by implementing the Inverse Compton Scattering Mechanism. From pulsar radio observation, it is seen that a couple of pulsars reveal new emission components at higher radio frequencies, although they show single-component emission at lower frequencies. We develop a brief outline, fostering inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the low-frequency radio photons as a vulnerable source of scattering, susceptible to explaining the evolution of new components of some radio pulsars at higher bands. We couple the conventional curvature radiation (CR) mechanism and ICS, and suggest that the spectral convolution of the flux component individually from CR and the modulated template due to the ICS scattered component can be combined to reproduce such signatures associated with the diverse morphology of the integrated pulse profile. We reproduce the beam frequency diagram, the geometrical variation of different parameters of the emission geometry, as well as the multi-frequency evolution from theory. We have suitably tuned the input parameter space and given the combination of parameters that can tune to a particular scattered frequency in tabulated form. We conclude that ICS may be a responsible process for describing the emergence of new components in higher radio emission bands.</description>

      <title>Investigating Pulsar Wind Nebula DA 495: Insights from LHAASO and Multi-Wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar wind nebula DA~495 (G65.7+1.2) has been extensively observed from radio to TeV $\gamma$-ray bands. We present LHAASO observations of DA~495, revealing an energy-dependent morphology, where an extended source with $r_{39}=0.19^{\circ}\pm0.02^{\circ}$ is detected by WCDA (0.4-15~TeV), and a point-like source with a 95\% upper limit of $r_{39}=0.11^{\circ}$ is observed by KM2A ($&gt;25~\mathrm{TeV}$). The spectrum of the source extends beyond 100~TeV with a break or cutoff at a few tens of TeV. Our X-ray data analysis, based on Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, shows that the X-ray emission of DA~495 extends well to $\sim 6^{\prime}$, significantly larger than the size previously reported. The broadband spectral energy distribution across radio, X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is phenomenologically described by a one-zone leptonic model, yielding an average magnetic field of $\sim$ 5 $\mathrm{\mu G}$, while Fermi-LAT spectral analysis indicates a likely presence of a $\gamma$-ray pulsar within the system. A time-dependent model, in which particle transport is convection-dominated in the inner region (within $\sim100^{\prime\prime}$) and diffusion-dominated in the outer region, successfully reproduces the observed radial profiles of X-ray surface brightness and spectral index, and also accounts for the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission detected by LHAASO, suggesting that DA~495 represents an evolved PWN with ongoing particle escape that gives rise to a TeV halo component -- that is, a PWN+halo system.</description>

      <title>Broadband study of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar eRASSU J012422.9-724248 in the Magellanic Bridge, near the Eastern Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first four all-sky surveys with eROSITA the soft X-ray instrument on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) satellite revealed a new X-ray source, eRASSU J012422.9-724248, in the Magellanic Bridge, near the Eastern Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We performed a broadband timing and spectral analysis using the optical and X-ray data of eRASSU J012422.9-724248. Using the X-ray observations with eROSITA, Swift, NuSTAR and optical data from the optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), we confirm the nature of eRASSU J012422.9-724248 as a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) pulsar in the Magellanic bridge. The position is coincident with that of an early-type star (OGLE ID SMC732.10.7). We detect the spin period at 341.71 s in NuSTAR data and infer a period of 63.65 days from the 15 year monitoring with OGLE, that we interpret as the orbital period of the system. A tentative CRSF at ~12.3 keV is identified in NuSTAR spectra with ~1.8-sigma. The source appears to show a persistent X-ray luminosity and an optical magnitude transition on the long timescale. We propose eRASSU J012422.9-724248 is a new member of the class of persistent BeXRBs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magneto-ionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs), can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a $\sim 90^\circ$ PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few $\times10~\rm{rad~m^{-2}}$ between the multiple images. The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B-earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies-can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios. These results suggest that plasma lensing could account for multiple complex observational features of FRBs and may play a non-negligible role in modulating their observable properties.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as Hidden Neutrino Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are enigmatic, compact, red galaxies at high redshift, $z\sim 4$-$7$, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope. Broad emission lines in the absence of X-ray and radio counterparts suggest that they host accreting supermassive black holes embedded in dense gaseous envelopes. This black-hole-envelope configuration facilitates efficient photohadronic interactions and neutrino production. Remarkably, their observed source number density and luminosity are compatible with the energetics of the diffuse neutrino background. We consider that relativistic jets and outflows are launched from the black hole and propagate through low-density polar funnels within envelopes, where particle acceleration and neutrino emission occur. This leads to LRDs being effectively hidden sources. Our analytic and numerical calculations show that, in an optimistic scenario, LRDs can contribute $\sim 30\%$ of the observed diffuse background at TeV$-$sub-PeV energies, predominantly through photomeson production. At high neutrino energies, $\gtrsim 10^{5.5}~{\rm GeV}$, inverse-Compton cooling of muons modifies the resulting flavor ratio, providing a distinctive diagnostic for IceCube-Gen2 and other upcoming neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Fast Flavor Conversion by Red Turbulence in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in supernovae, driven by neutrino-neutrino refraction, can catastrophically equilibrate flavors and potentially affect the neutrino-driven explosion. We present a pivotal insight: matter density fluctuations characterized by red spectra ($\nu&lt;0$), naturally arising in stratified supernova environments, can suppress such instabilities by inducing accelerated decoherence. By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|\nu|}$-we uncover a novel acceleration of coherence loss. This dynamical decoherence mechanism raises an effective energy barrier against the collective growth of flavor instabilities. Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($\nu \sim -1$, fluctuation strength $\xi_\nu \sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration (or vice versa). Our work provides the first analytical criterion for FFC suppression in turbulent media and identifies red turbulence as a critical, physics-grounded ingredient missing from current supernova models.</description>

      <title>Analytical approaches to the study of the phase of the visibility function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radio interferometric observations, the main source of information is the complex visibility function, which includes amplitude and phase. In this paper, the dependence of the phase of the visibility function on the base projection is investigated when used in radio interferometry with space bases up to six Earth diameters. The dependence of the phase of the visibility function on the projection of the base and direction is obtained. It is shown that for small values of the base projections, this dependence has a universal character and is consistent with the results of numerical magnetohydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarization of the Intrabinary Shock in Redback Pulsar J1723$-$2837</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrabinary shocks (IBS) in spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron X-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind, likely energized by magnetic reconnection. The double-peaked X-ray light curves from these shocks have been well characterized in several spider systems. In this paper, we analyze Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of the redback pulsar J1723$-$2837 to examine the expected synchrotron polarization. Using advanced extraction methods that include spatial, temporal, and particle background weights, we constrain the polarization of the IBS. We compare different models for the magnetic field in the radiation zone and find that the best fit prefers a striped pulsar wind model over other polarized models, with maximum polarization degree of the IBS emission component $\Pi_{\rm IBS}=36^{+16}_{-15}\%$, in addition to an unpolarized non-IBS component. Since this is only 2.4$\sigma$, we cannot claim strong preference over an unpolarized model; we report a $99\%$ confidence level upper limit on the total polarization of both IBS and non-IBS components $\Pi_{99}&lt;36\%$, which is improved over the $50\%$ limit obtained in previous work. The best-fit polarization of the IBS component is consistent with numerical simulations. Detailed tests of such models are accessible to future measurements.</description>

      <title>Simulating cosmic ray electron spectra and radio emission from an AGN jet outburst in a cool-core cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered jets can accelerate cosmic ray electrons, leading to the observed radio synchrotron emission. To simulate this emission, jet dynamics in galaxy clusters must be coupled to electron spectral modelling. We run magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a single AGN jet outburst in a Perseus-like galaxy cluster and adopt a sub-grid model for the acceleration of cosmic ray protons and electrons at unresolved internal shocks in the jet. We evolve cosmic ray electron spectra along Lagrangian trajectories using the Fokker-Planck solver Crest and compute the non-thermal emission using Crayon+. The resulting total electron spectrum reaches a steady-state slope at high momenta, with a gradually decreasing normalization over time, while the lower-momentum portion continues to resemble a freely cooling spectrum. The interaction of the jets with the turbulent cluster environment inflates lobes which rise buoyantly, induce amplification of the magnetic fields and uplift old cosmic ray populations in the wake of the bubbles. We connect radio spectral indices to electron injection ages: at a given radio frequency, weaker magnetic fields are illuminated by higher momenta electrons, whose age is determined by the last injection event. On the other hand, stronger magnetic fields are illuminated by lower momenta electrons, whose age is determined by the maximum energy injection event in the past. This powerful approach allows us to relate the underlying MHD properties to electron spectra and the resulting radio synchrotron emission, thereby enabling us to infer the underlying physics from observed radio properties.</description>

      <title>Shadow signatures and energy accumulation in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole has been recently introduced as a geodesically complete spacetime featuring a signature shift at the event horizon where causal geodesics are precluded from reaching the central $r=0$ singularity. In this paper, we investigate the shadows produced by this geometry to identify deviations from the standard Schwarzschild solution. Our analysis reveals an excess intensity in the inner shadow region that points to a potential observational signature of the novel behavior of light rays propagating near the event horizon. This excess could be a probe for horizon-scale modifications of black hole geometries. Furthermore, although the horizon surface of the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole continuously accumulates photons and energy, we show that its backreaction response differs from that of stable light rings found in various exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: WIMP dark matter constraints from the cross-correlation of weak lensing and Fermi-LAT gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter dominates the matter content of the Universe, and its properties can be constrained through large-scale structure probes such as the cross-correlation between the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) and weak gravitational lensing. We analysed 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, constructing UGRB intensity maps in ten energy bins (0.5-1000 GeV), and cross-correlated them with KiDS-Legacy shear in six tomographic bins. The measurements were performed using angular power spectra estimated with the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method. No significant cross-correlation is found. Based on this non-detection, we present 95% upper bounds on the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) decay rate $\Gamma_{\rm dec}$ and velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section $\langle\sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle$ as functions of mass. We compare our results with bounds from other cosmological tracers and from local probes, and found them to be complementary, particularly at low masses ($\rm GeV/TeV$). In addition, using a Euclid-like lensing survey cross-correlated with Fermi-LAT, we forecast $\sim$2 times tighter limits, highlighting the potential of forthcoming data to strengthen constraints on dark matter annihilation and decay.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference of gravitational-wave signals in the time domain using a heterodyned likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals is computationally intensive and typically requires millions of likelihood evaluations to construct posterior probability distributions. This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference.</description>

      <title>Rescaling Transforms for Local Models of Spherical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously we developed a local model for a spherically contracting/expanding gas cloud that can be used to study turbulence and small scale instabilities in such flows. In this work we generalise the super-comoving variables used in studies of cosmological structure formation to our local spherical flow model, which make it significantly easier to derive analytical solutions and analyse the interactions of more complex flows with the background. We show that a wide class of solutions to the local spherical flow model can be obtained via a mapping from the corresponding solutions in regular Cartesian flows. The rescaling of time in the transformation results in a modification of the linear instabilities that can occur in spherical flows, causing them to have a time dependent growth rate in the physical time coordinate, and can prevent slower instabilities from operating. Finally, we show that the small scale flows in isotropic contraction/expansion can be mapped directly to Cartesian, inviscid, incompressible hydrodynamics, meaning that one expects a form of rescaled Kolmogorov-turbulence at the small scale of isotropically contracting/expanding flows.</description>

      <title>Impact of baryons on the population of Galactic subhalos and implications for dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used Auriga -- a set of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-size systems -- to study the impact of baryons on the Galactic subhalo population. A DM-only run counterpart of Auriga allows us to compare results with and without baryons. We repopulate the original suites with low-mass subhalos orders of magnitude lighter than the mass resolution limit, starting from a detailed characterization of Auriga data in the well-resolved subhalo mass range. The survival of low-mass subhalos to tidal forces is unclear and under debate nowadays, thus in our study we stay agnostic and consider two different levels of subhalo resilience to tidal stripping ('fragile' and 'resilient' subhalos). We find baryons to alter the Galactic substructure significantly, by decreasing its overall abundance by a factor $\sim2.4$ (fragile) and $\sim1.9$ (resilient) and subhalo concentration -- here defined in terms of maximum circular velocity -- by $\sim1.5$ with respect to the DM-only scenario. This has important consequences for indirect searches of DM. As an example, we investigated the case of using unidentified gamma-ray sources to set constraints on the DM particle properties, assuming some of them may be dark satellites. We find the DM annihilation cross-section constraints to worsen by a factor $\sim3.6$ in the most realistic scenario of including baryons, compared to DM-only simulations in the 'fragile' setup. Yet, a stronger resilience of subhalos to tidal stripping improves these DM limits by a factor $\sim4.5$ and $\sim10$ compared to the DM-only and hydrodynamical 'fragile' cases, respectively. Our results show the importance of including baryons to properly characterize the Galactic subhalo population, as well as to propose the most optimal subhalo search strategies, not only via its potential DM annihilation products but also through their gravitational signatures.</description>

      <title>Pseudo Little Red Dot: an Active Black Hole Embedded in a Dense and Dusty, Metal-Poor Starburst Galaxy at z=5.96</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 &gt;~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 Msun. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta &lt; 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H &gt;~ 10^6 cm^{-3}) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^{+1.54}_{-0.79} x10^7 Msun and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^{+725}_{-310} Msun/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD.</description>

      <title>GW231109_235456: A Sub-threshold Binary Neutron Star Merger in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a Observing Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a subthreshold search for gravitational-wave inspirals from binary neutron stars using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model informed by radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of one per fifty years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7. This trigger was first reported in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently listed in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a subthreshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five arising from four previous searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the candidate is approximately one per ten years. If the event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 solar masses with an uncertainty of plus 0.38 and minus 0.07 solar masses. The event is localized to a region of 450 square degrees enclosing ninety percent probability at a luminosity distance of 165 megaparsecs with an uncertainty of plus 70 and minus 69 megaparsecs. Assuming the signal arises from a binary neutron star merger, we estimate the local merger rate to lie between 53 and 342 per cubic gigaparsec per year.</description>

Abstract: In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-30$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Simulation-calibrated Bayesian inference for progenitor properties of the microquasar SS 433</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SS$\,$433 is one of the most extreme Galactic X-ray binaries, launching semi-relativistic jets and showing clear signs of super-critical accretion onto what is likely a black hole. Yet the properties of the binary system that produced it remain uncertain. To solve the inverse problem of inferring the progenitor properties of binaries that evolve into SS$\,$433-like systems, we use an iterative, simulation-based calibration framework that combines Bayesian inference with the isolated binary-evolution code COSMIC. Using six measured properties of SS$\,$433 and the dynamic nested sampler $\texttt{dynesty}$, we explore a ten-dimensional space of possible progenitor masses, orbits, mass-transfer histories, and natal-kick velocities. This approach identifies the regions of parameter space most consistent with SS$\,$433 and allows us to iteratively refine the resulting progenitor distributions. We find 90% confidence intervals for the progenitor initial primary mass of (8, 11) M$_\odot$, secondary mass of (32, 40) M$_\odot$, orbital period of (136, 2259) days, eccentricity of (0.26, 0.6), common-envelope efficiency of (0.44, 0.76), accreted fraction during stable mass transfer of (0.22, 0.6), and black-hole natal-kick magnitude of (5, 68) km/s. These results show that direct probabilistic inference of X-ray binary progenitors can yield new constraints on the formation of extreme accretion systems like SS$\,$433, which has important implications for theoretical expectations of the population of SS$\,$433-like systems in the Galaxy and their connection with cosmic ray observations.</description>

      <title>Study of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and BL Lacertae Objects as Sources of Diffusive Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine whether Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) can act as plausible astrophysical sources of diffuse ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Using realistic luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) functions derived from observed gamma-ray luminosity functions for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we calculate the redshift evolution of the cosmic ray source population through integrated luminosity functions. The diffuse UHECRs flux from these sources is modelled by propagating nuclei through extragalactic space, including energy losses from interactions with cosmic photon backgrounds. The resulting UHECRs spectra are compared with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, with fluxes normalised at reference energies. We also construct illustrative full skymaps of the integral UHECRs flux from $10$ EeV to $100$ EeV using the \textsc{HEALPix} framework, assuming a uniform distribution of synthetic sources and including energy-dependent magnetic diffusion. The regions of higher flux in the maps arise naturally from propagation effects and the limited UHECRs horizon. Our results indicate that LDDE-modelled AGNs could contribute significantly to the observed diffuse UHECRs flux and provide constraints on their role as potential sources.</description>

      <title>Verifying the failing supernova constraint on dark photons with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies on the dark photon (DP) production in collapsing stars argue that the cooling effect induced by DPs can hinder supernova explosions and lead to a ``failing supernova" constraint on the photon-DP mixing parameter $\epsilon$. In order to verify the idea, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the DP production with the masses of 0.3 and 0.45\,MeV. We find that the shock revival does not happen until the end of the simulations when $\epsilon\gtrsim3\times10^{-9}$. The photon-DP mixing parameter above this value can be excluded by the failing supernova argument. Interestingly, our constraint roughly coincides with the one reported by the previous studies which adopted the post-processing framework. This result motivates one to investigate a wider parameter range of DPs with self-consistent simulations and evaluate uncertainties in the constraint.</description>

      <title>The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical binary black hole merger rate may cause the $z$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.</description>

      <title>The maximum mass ratio of hierarchical binary black hole mergers may cause the $q$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>

Abstract: Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.</description>

      <title>Brightest GRB flare observed in GRB 221009A: bridge the last gap between flare and prompt emission in GRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in soft X-ray, optical and radio bands, but rarely in gamma-ray band. Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.</description>

      <title>Circumbinary disks in post common envelope binary systems with compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a population synthesis study using the binary population synthesis code compas to explore the formation of circumbinary disks (CBDs) following the common envelope evolution (CEE) phase of a giant star and a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double compact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to form a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and the compact object alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions for CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO progenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD formation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected to merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the CBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the expected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or expand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to the CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH and the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources. Thus, accounting for post-CEE CBD formation and its interaction with the binary system in population synthesis studies is significant for obtaining reliable predictions of the gravitational wave event rates expected by current detectors.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\,2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \text{\AA} doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at $2.3$ $\mu$m from 250 to 319 days in the NIR.</description>

      <title>Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for additional disk wind ejecta.</description>

      <title>Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</description>
