      <title>Higher order hypoelliptic damped wave equations on graded Lie groups with data from negative order Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb G$ be a graded Lie group with homogeneous dimension $Q$. In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for a semilinear hypoelliptic damped wave equation involving a positive Rockland operator $\mathcal{R}$ of homogeneous degree $\nu\geq 2$ on $\mathbb G$ with power type nonlinearity $|u|^p$ and initial data taken from negative order homogeneous Sobolev space $\dot H^{-\gamma}(\mathbb G), \gamma&gt;0$. In the framework of Sobolev spaces of negative order, we prove that $p_{\text{Crit}}(Q, \gamma, \nu) :=1+\frac{2\nu}{Q+2\gamma}$ is the new critical exponent for $\gamma\in (0, \frac{Q}{2})$. More precisely, we show the global-in-time existence of small data Sobolev solutions of lower regularity for $p&gt;p_{\text{Crit}}(Q, \gamma, \nu) $ in the energy evolution space $ \mathcal{C}\left([0, T], H^{s}(\mathbb{G})\right), s\in (0, 1]$. Under certain conditions on the initial data, we also prove a finite-time blow-up of weak solutions for $1&lt;p&lt;p_{\text{Crit}}(Q, \gamma, \nu)$. Furthermore, to precisely characterize the blow-up time, we derive sharp upper bound and lower bound estimates for the lifespan in the subcritical cases. We emphasize that our results are also new, even in the setting of higher-order differential operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and more generally, on stratified Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of large solution for the compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations governed by the evolution of compressible fluids with capillarity effects. We first investigate the global well-posedness of solution in the critical Besov space for large initial data. Contrary to pure parabolic methods in Charve, Danchin and Xu \cite{CDX}, we also take the strong dispersion due to large capillarity coefficient $\kappa$ into considerations. By establishing a dissipative-dispersive estimate, we are able to obtain uniform estimates and incompressible limits in terms of $\kappa$ simultaneously.
  Secondly, we establish the large time behaviors of the solution. We would make full use of both parabolic mechanics and dispersive structure which implicates our decay results without limitations for upper bound of derivatives while requiring no smallness for initial assumption.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of Kato's solutions for the 3D incompressible micropolar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the global well-posedness and decay rates for solutions of 3D incompressible micropolar equation in the critical Besov space. Spectrum analysis allows us to find not only parabolic behaviors of solutions, but also damping effect of angular velocity in the low frequencies. Based on this observation, we establish the global well-posedness with more general regularity on the initial data.
  The approach concerns large time behaviors is so-called the Gevrey method which bases on the parabolic mechanics of the micropolar system. This method enables us even to derive decay of \textit{arbitrary} higher order derivatives by transforming it into the control of the radius of analyticity under a particular regularity.
  To bound the growth of the radius of analyticity in general $L^p$ Besov spaces, we shall develop some new techniques concern Gevrey estimates, especially an extended Coifman-Meyer theory, to cover those endpoint Lebesgue framework.</description>

      <title>Compactness results for a Dirichlet energy of nonlocal gradient with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two compactness results for function spaces with finite Dirichlet energy of half-space nonlocal gradients. In each of these results, we provide sufficient conditions on a sequence of kernel functions that guarantee the asymptotic compact embedding of the associated nonlocal function spaces into the class of square-integrable functions. Moreover, we will demonstrate that the sequence of nonlocal function spaces converges in an appropriate sense to a limiting function space. As an application, we prove uniform Poincar\'e-type inequalities for sequence of half-space gradient operators. We also apply the compactness result to demonstrate the convergence of appropriately parameterized nonlocal heterogeneous anisotropic diffusion problems. We will construct asymptotically compatible schemes for these type of problems. Another application concerns the convergence and robust discretization of a nonlocal optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>The Physisorbate-Layer Problem Arising in Kinetic Theory of Gas-Surface Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A half-space problem of a linear kinetic equation for gas molecules physisorbed close to a solid surface, relevant to a kinetic model of gas-surface interactions and derived by Aoki et al. [K.~Aoki et al., in: Phys. Rev. E 106:035306, 2022], is considered. The equation contains a confinement potential in the vicinity of the solid surface and an interaction term between gas molecules and phonons. It is proved that a unique solution exists when the incoming molecular flux is specified at infinity. This validates the natural observation that the half-space problem serves as the boundary condition for the Boltzmann equation. It is also proved that the sequence of approximate solutions used for the existence proof converges exponentially fast. In addition, numerical results showing the details of the solution to the half-space problem are presented.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of quasimonochromatic breathers for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries and Zakharov-Kuznetsov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equations with power nonlinearities $q=2,3,4\ldots$ in dimension $N=1$, and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) model with integer power nonlinearities $q$ in higher dimensions $N\geq 2$. Among these power-type models, the only conjectured equation with space localized time periodic breathers is the modified KdV (mKdV), corresponding to the case $q=3$ and $N=1$. Quasimonochromatic solutions were introduced by Mandel to show that sine-Gordon is the only scalar field model with breather solutions among this class. In this paper we consider smooth generalized quasimonochromatic solutions of arbitrary size for gKdV and ZK models and provide a rigorous proof that mKdV is the unique power-like model among them with spatially localized breathers of this type. In particular, we show the nonexistence of breathers of this class in the ZK models. The method of proof involves the use of the naturally coherent algebra of Bell's polynomials to obtain particularly distinctive structural elliptic PDEs satisfied by breather-like quasimonochromatic solutions. A reduction of the problem to the classification of solutions of these elliptic PDEs in the entire space is performed, and de Giorgi type uniqueness results are proved in this particular case, concluding the uniqueness of the mKdV breather, and the nonexistence of localized smooth breathers in the ZK case. No assumption on well-posedness is made, and the power of the nonlinearity is arbitrary.</description>

      <title>Wave maps in dimension $1+1$ with an external forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish the local and global well-posedness theory in $L^1$, inspired by the approach of Keel and Tao [Internat. Math. Res. Notices, 1998], for the forced wave map equation in the ``external'' formalism. In this context, the target manifold is treated as a submanifold of a Euclidean space. As a corollary, we reprove Zhou's [Math. Z., 1999] uniqueness result, leading to the uniqueness of weak solutions with locally finite energy. Additionally, we achieve the scattering of such solutions through a conformal compactification argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct entire solutions of bistable reaction-diffusion equations by mixing finite planar fronts, which form a finite-dimensional manifold. These entire solutions are generalized traveling fronts, that is, transition fronts. We also show their uniqueness and stability. Furthermore, we prove that transition fronts with level sets having finite facets are determined by finite planar fronts and they are in the class of entire solutions constructed by us.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial solutions to the relative overdetermined torsion problem in a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded regular domain $\omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ and the half-cylinder $\Sigma = \omega \times (0,+\infty)$, we consider the relative overdetermined torsion problem in $\Sigma$, i.e.
\[\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\Delta {u}+1=0 &amp;\mbox{in $\Omega$},\newline
\partial_\eta u = 0 &amp;\mbox{on $\widetilde \Gamma_\Omega$},\newline
u=0 &amp;\mbox{on $\Gamma_\Omega$},\newline
\partial_{\nu}u =c &amp;\mbox{on $\Gamma_\Omega$}.
\end{array} \right.
  \] where $\Omega \subset \Sigma$, $\Gamma_\Omega = \partial \Omega \cap \Sigma$, $\widetilde \Gamma_\Omega = \partial \Omega \setminus \Gamma_\Omega$, $\nu$ is the outer unit normal vector on $\Gamma_\Omega$ and $\eta$ is the outer unit normal vector on $\widetilde \Gamma_\Omega$. We build nontrivial solutions to this problem in domains $\Omega$ that are the hypograph of certain nonconstant functions $v : \overline{\omega} \to (0, + \infty)$. Such solutions can be reflected with respect to $\omega$, giving nontrivial solutions to the relative overdetermined torsion problem in a cylinder. The proof uses a local bifurcation argument which, quite remarkably, works for any generic base $\omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses a Kirchhoff type quasilinear space-time fractional integro-differential equation with memory $(\mathcal{K}^{s}_{\alpha})$. Various a priori bounds are derived in different norms on the solution of the considered equation. Utilizing these a priori bounds, existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to the proposed model are proved. Furthermore, regularity results on the solution of $(\mathcal{K}^{s}_{\alpha})$ are established. The contribution made in this work provides a framework for further investigation of such types of partial integro-differential equation $(\mathcal{K}^{s}_{\alpha})$.</description>

      <title>A generalized Liouville equation and magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers two related families of nonlinear and nonlocal problems in the plane $\R^2$. The first main result derives the general integrable solution to a generalized Liouville equation using the Wronskian of two coprime complex polynomials. The second main result concerns an application to a generalized Ladyzhenskaya--Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality, with a single real parameter $\beta$ interpreted as the strength of a magnetic self-interaction. The optimal constant of the inequality and the corresponding minimizers of the quotient are studied and it is proved that for $\beta \ge 2$, for which the constant equals $2\pi\beta$, such minimizers only exist at quantized $\beta \in 2\N$ corresponding to nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels with densities solving the generalized Liouville equation. This latter problem originates from the study of self-dual vortex solitons in the abelian Chern--Simons--Higgs theory and from the average-field-Pauli effective theory of anyons, i.e.\ quantum particles with statistics intermediate to bosons and fermions. An immediate application is given to Keller--Lieb--Thirring stability bounds for a gas of such anyons which self-interact magnetically (vector nonlocal repulsion) as well as electrostatically (scalar local/point attraction), thus generalizing the stability theory of the 2D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-based stability of blowup with log correction for semilinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative proof of the classical result of type-I blowup with log correction for the semilinear equation. Compared with previous proofs, we use a novel idea of enforcing stable normalizations for perturbation around the approximate profile and establish a weighted $H^k$ stability, thereby avoiding the use of a topological argument and the analysis of a linearized spectrum. Therefore, this approach can be adopted even if we only have a numerical profile and do not have explicit information on the spectrum of its linearized operator. This result generalizes the $L^2$-based stability argument to blowups that are not exactly self-similar and can be adapted to higher dimensions. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of our normalization, even in the large perturbation regime beyond our theoretical setting.</description>

      <title>Entropy on the Path Space and Application to Singular Diffusions and Mean-field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a (partly) new approach for the study of McKean-Vlasov equations, including singular interactions. This approach is based on the relativeentropy on the path space in the spirit of our previous works together with C. L{\'e}onard. Itis also used in a recent work of D. Lacker.We show how it can be used to derive existence and uniqueness for some singular diffusions, in particular linear mean field stochastic particle systems and non linear SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, including Lp- Lq models, the 2D vortex model associated to the 2D Navier-Stokes equation, sub-Coulombic interactions models or the Patlak-Keller-Segel model.We also show the convergence and propagation of chaos as the number of particles grows to infinity. This is obtained at the process level, not only at the Liouville equation level.The paper thus contains new proofs and extensions of known results, as well as new results.The main results are given at the end of the Introduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Kato square root estimate with anisotropically degenerate matrix coefficients. We do so by doing the harmonic analysis using an auxiliary Riemannian metric adapted to the operator. We also derive $L^2$-solvability estimates for boundary value problems for divergence form elliptic equations with matrix degenerate coefficients. Main tools are chain rules and Piola transformations for fields in matrix weighted $L^2$ spaces, under $W^{1,1}$ homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>On variable Lebesgue spaces and generalized nonlinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work  we address some questions concerning  the Cauchy problem for a generalized nonlinear heat equations considering as functional framework the variable Lebesgue spaces  $L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. More precisely, by mixing some structural properties of these spaces with decay estimates of the fractional heat kernel, we were able to prove two well-posedness results for these equations.  In a first theorem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global-in-time  mild solutions in the mixed-space $\mathcal{L}^{p(\cdot)}_{   \frac{nb}{2\alpha - \langle 1 \rangle_\gamma}  } (\mathbb{R}^n,L^\infty([0,T[ ))$. On the other hand,  by introducing a new class of variable exponents, we demonstrate the existence of an unique local-in-time mild solution  in the space $L^{p(\cdot)} \left( [0,T], L^{q} (\mathbb{R}^3) \right)$.</description>

      <title>Construction of smooth chiral finite-time blow-up solutions to Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS), which is an $L^{2}$-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with explicit solitons, self-duality, and pseudo-conformal symmetry. More importantly, this equation is known to be completely integrable in the Hardy space $L_{+}^{2}$ and the solutions in this class are referred to as \emph{chiral} solutions. A rigorous PDE analysis of this equation with complete integrability was recently initiated by G\'erard and Lenzmann.
  Our main result constructs smooth, chiral, and finite energy finite-time blow-up solutions with mass arbitrarily close to that of soliton, answering the global regularity question for chiral solutions raised by G\'erard and Lenzmann. The blow-up rate obtained for these solutions is different from the pseudo-conformal rate. Our proof also gives a construction of a codimension one set of smooth finite energy initial data (but without addressing chirality) leading to the same blow-up dynamics. Our blow-up construction in the Hardy space might also be contrasted with the global well-posedness of the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS), which is another integrable $L^{2}$-critical Schr\"odinger equation.
  The overall scheme of our proof is the forward construction of blow-up dynamics with modulation analysis and is not reliant on complete integrability. We begin with developing a linear theory for the near soliton dynamics. We discover a nontrivial conjugation identity, which unveils a surprising connection from the linearized (CM-DNLS) to the 1D free Schr\"odinger equation, which is a crucial ingredient for overcoming the difficulties from the non-local nonlinearity. Another principal challenge in this work, the slow decay of soliton, is overcome by introducing a trick of decomposing solutions depending on topologies, which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Quintic Energy Critical Wave in 3D Cylindrical Convex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the well-posedness in energy space for the quintic energy critical wave inside a cylindrical convex domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega\neq\emptyset$. The key tools to prove local well-posedness are the dispersive estimates obtained in \cite{L,L1,L3} and the Strichartz estimates in \cite{L2}. We point out that our result on the local and global existence of the solution to the wave equation in the cylindrical domain setting interpolates between that of in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ (see \cite{MG}) and in any bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (see \cite{BLP}). Moreover, the result of the Strichartz estimates in our setting is strong enough when combined with the arguments in \cite{BLP,SS2} so that we can extend local to global well-posedness.</description>

      <title>Coerciveness and Morrey Inequalities for Elliptic Operators with Natural Boundary Conditions via Weitzenb\"ock Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Weitzenb\"ock identity for general pairs of constant coefficient homogeneous first order partial differential operators, and deduce from it sufficient algebraic conditions for coerciveness and Morrey estimates under the natural 1/2 boundary conditions. Our proof of the $W^{1,2}$ elliptic estimate relies on the Aronszajn-Necas-Smith coercive estimate. For generalized strongly pseudoconvex domains, we improve the Morrey estimate to a weighted $W^{1,2}$ square function estimate, using a generalized Cauchy-Pompieu reproducing formula and the T1 theorem for singular integrals. We use Van Schaftingen's notion of cocanceling to study the generalized Levi forms appearing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of uniformly rotating solutions for the vortex-wave system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the radial symmetry properties of stationary and uniformly rotating solutions of the vortex-wave system introduced by Marchioro and Pulvirenti \cite{Mar1}. We show that every uniformly rotating patch $\left(D,x_1,x_2,..,x_k\right)$ with angular velocity $\Omega\leq 0$ must be radial with respect to the only point vortex $x_1$, implying that $k=1$. In other words, the background vorticity consists of finite nested annulus and the point vortex is located at the center of these annulus. In contrast to the case where the angular velocity is non-positive, we prove that there exists a family of uniformly rotating patch $(D^n, x_1^n)_n$ solutions, which are associated with a sequence of positive angular velocities $\{\Omega_n\}$ and are not annular. Furthermore, we find that the set of bifurcating angular velocities $\{\Omega_n\}$ is dense in the interval $(0,+\infty)$, a novel feature that distinguishes this behavior from that observed in the classical Euler equation and gSQG equation.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Phase Transition Problems with Evolving Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mathematical analysis and homogenization of a moving boundary problem posed for a highly heterogeneous, periodically perforated domain. More specifically, we are looking at a one-phase thermo-elasticity system with phase transformations where small inclusions, initially periodically distributed, are growing or shrinking based on a kinetic under-cooling-type law and where surface stresses are created based on the curvature of the phase interface. This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but $\varespilon$-independent time interval ($\varespilon$ is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we discover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct byproduct of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective precomputing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to solving the Buckley-Leverett System, which is to consider a compressible approximation model characterized by a stiff pressure law. Passing to the incompressible limit, the compressible model gives rise to a Hele-Shaw type free boundary limit of Buckley-Leverett System, and it is shown the existence of a weak solution of it.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence of the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

      <title>On inverse problems in multi-population aggregation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on inverse problems arising in studying multi-population aggregations. The goal is to reconstruct the diffusion coefficient, advection coefficient, and interaction kernels of the aggregation system, which characterize the dynamics of different populations. In the theoretical analysis of the physical setup, it is crucial to ensure non-negativity of solutions. To address this, we employ the high-order variation method and introduce modifications to the systems. Additionally, we propose a novel approach called transformative asymptotic technique that enables the recovery of the diffusion coefficient preceding the Laplace operator, presenting a pioneering method for this type of problems. Through these techniques, we offer comprehensive insights into the unique identifiability aspect of inverse problems associated with multi-population aggregation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that buoyancy driven flows can be steered in an arbitrary time towards any state by applying as control only an external temperature profile in a subset of small measure. More specifically, we prove that the 2D incompressible Boussinesq system on the torus is globally approximately controllable via physically localized heating or cooling. In addition, our controls have an explicitly prescribed structure; even without such structural requirements, large data controllability results for Boussinesq flows driven merely by a physically localized temperature profile were so far unknown. The presented method exploits various connections between the model's underlying transport-, coupling-, and scaling mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for cubic quasilinear Schroedinger flows in two and higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work the authors proposed a broad global well-posedness conjecture for cubic defocusing dispersive equations in one space dimension, and then proved this conjecture in two cases, namely for one dimensional semilinear and quasilinear Schr\"odinger flows.
  Inspired by the circle of ideas developed in the proof of the above conjecture, in this paper we expand the reach of these methods to higher dimensional quasilinear cubic Schr\"odinger flows. The study of this class of problems, in all dimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized initial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru (MMT) for initial data in Sobolev spaces.
  The outcomes of this work are (i) a new, potentially sharp local well-posedness result in low regularity Sobolev spaces, one derivative below MMT and just one half derivative above scaling, (ii) a small data global well-posedness and scattering result at the same regularity level, the first result of its kind at least in two space dimensions, and (iii) a new way to think about this class of problems, which, we believe, will become the standard approach in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes an inexact gradient method based on incremental proper orthogonal decomposition (iPOD) to address the data storage difficulty in time-dependent PDE-constrained optimization, particularly for a data assimilation problem as a detailed demonstration for the key ideas. The proposed method is proved robust by rigorous analysis. We first derive a sharp data compression error estimate of the iPOD with the help of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Then we demonstrate a numerical PDE analysis to show how to properly choose Hilbert space for the iPOD data compression so that the gradient error is under control. We further prove that for a convex problem with appropriately bounded gradient error, the inexact gradient method achieves the accuracy level of the optimal solution while not hurting the convergence rate compared with the usual gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results and validate the proposed method.</description>

A manifold endowed with a metric $g$ whose operator $\delta\mathcal{R}^*$ has a nontrivial kernel is called a Perelman singular manifold. In this paper, we present examples and apply general maximum principles to obtain rigidity or nonexistence results in the underlying setting.</description>

      <title>Implicit EXP-RBF techniques for modeling unsaturated flow through soils with water uptake by plant roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling unsaturated flow through soils with water uptake by plan root has many applications in agriculture and water resources management. In this study, our aim is to develop efficient numerical techniques for solving the Richards equation with a sink term due to plant root water uptake. The Feddes model is used for water absorption by plant roots, and the van-Genuchten model is employed for capillary pressure. We introduce a numerical approach that combines the localized exponential radial basis function (EXP-RBF) method for space and the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) for temporal discretization. The localized RBF methods eliminate the need for mesh generation and avoid ill-conditioning problems. This approach yields a sparse matrix for the global system, optimizing memory usage and computational time. The proposed implicit EXP-RBF techniques have advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency thanks to the use of BDF2 and the localized RBF method. Modified Picards iteration method for the mixed form of the Richards equation is employed to linearize the system. Various numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed numerical model of infiltration with plant root water absorption. The obtained results conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical model in accurately predicting soil moisture dynamics under water uptake by plant roots. The proposed numerical techniques can be incorporated in the numerical models where unsaturated flows and water uptake by plant roots are involved such as in hydrology, agriculture, and water management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the subdiffusion of variable exponent modeling subdiffusion phenomena with varying memory properties. The main difficulty is that this model could not be analytically solved and the variable-exponent Abel kernel may not be positive definite or monotonic. This work develops a tool called the generalized identity function to convert this model to more feasible formulations for mathematical and numerical analysis, based on which we prove its well-posedness and regularity. In particular, we characterize the singularity of the solutions in terms of the initial value of the exponent. Then the semi-discrete and fully-discrete numerical methods are developed and their error estimates are proved, without any regularity assumption on solutions or requiring specific properties of the variable-exponent Abel kernel. The convergence order is also characterized by the initial value of the exponent. Finally, we investigate an inverse problem of determining the initial value of the exponent.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central focus of this paper is the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for $C$-compatible sets, where $C$ is a pointed closed convex cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with nonempty interior. Such a problem deals with the characterization of the $(p, q)$-th dual curvature measure of a $C$-compatible set. It produces new Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations for unbounded convex hypersurface, often defined over open domains and with non-positive unknown convex functions. Within the family of $C$-determined sets, the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem is solved for $0\neq p\in \mathbb{R}$ and $q\in \mathbb{R}$; while it is solved for the range of $p\leq 0$ and $p&lt;q$ within the newly defined family of $(C, p, q)$-close sets. When $p\leq q$, we also obtain some results regarding the uniqueness of solutions to the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for $C$-compatible sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the Aharonov-Casher theorem, the Pauli operator $P$ has no zero eigenvalue when the normalized magnetic flux $\alpha$ satisfies $|\alpha|&lt;1$, but it does have a zero energy resonance. We prove that in this case a Lieb-Thirring inequality for the $\gamma$-th moment of the eigenvalues of $P+V$ is valid under the optimal restrictions $\gamma\geq |\alpha|$ and $\gamma&gt;0$. Besides the usual semiclassical integral, the right side of our inequality involves an integral where the zero energy resonance state appears explicitly. Our inequality improves earlier works that were restricted to moments of order $\gamma\geq 1$.</description>

The existence of a weak solution was proved recently, however, as in the deterministic setting the question of uniqueness remains a major open problem. An important feature of systems with uniqueness is the semigroup property satisfied by their solutions. Without uniqueness, this property cannot hold generally. We select a system of solutions satisfying the semigroup property with appropriately shifted rough path. In addition, the selected solutions respect the well accepted admissibility criterium for physical solutions, namely, maximization of the energy dissipation. Finally, under suitable assumptions on the driving rough path, we show that the Navier-Stokes system generates a measurable random dynamical system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a measurable single-valued random dynamical system in the state space for an SPDE without uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability of harmonic maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{S}^2$ with higher degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For degree $\pm 1$ harmonic maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ (or $\mathbb{S}^2$) to $\mathbb{S}^2$, Bernand-Mantel, Muratov and Simon \cite{bernand2021quantitative} recently establish a uniformly quantitative stability estimate. Namely, for any map $u:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$ with degree $\pm 1$, the discrepancy of its Dirichlet energy and $4\pi$ can linearly control the $\dot H^1$-difference of $u$ from the set of degree $\pm 1$ harmonic maps. Whether a similar estimate holds for harmonic maps with higher degree is unknown. In this paper, we prove that a similar quantitative stability result for higher degree is true only in local sense. Namely, given a harmonic map, a similar estimate holds if $u$ is already sufficiently near to it (modulo M\"{o}bius transform) and the bound in general depends on the given harmonic map. More importantly, we investigate an example of degree 2 case thoroughly, which shows that it fails to have a uniformly quantitative estimate like the degree $\pm 1$ case. This phenomenon show the striking difference of degree $\pm1$ ones and higher degree ones. Finally, we also conjecture a new uniformly quantitative stability estimate based on our computation.</description>

Abstract: We present a general approach to the parametrix construction. We apply it to prove the uniqueness and existence of a weak fundamental solution for the equation $\partial_t =\mathcal{L}$ with non-symmetric non-local operators $$ \mathcal{L}f(x):= b(x)\cdot \nabla f(x)+ \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}( f(x+z)-f(x)- 1_{|z|&lt;1} \left&lt;z,\nabla f(x)\right&gt;)\kappa(x,z)J(z)\, dz\,, $$ under certain assumptions on $b$, $\kappa$ and $J$. The result allows more general coefficients even for $J(z)=|z|^{-d-1}$.</description>

      <title>Kohler-Jobin meets Ehrhard: the sharp lower bound for the Gaussian principal frequency while the Gaussian torsional rigidity is fixed, via rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an adaptation of the Kohler-Jobin rearrangement technique to the setting of the Gauss space. As a result, we prove the Gaussian analogue of the Kohler-Jobin's resolution of a conjecture of P\'{o}lya-Szeg\"o: when the Gaussian torsional rigidity of a (convex) domain is fixed, the Gaussian principal frequency is minimized for the half-space. At the core of this rearrangement technique is the idea of considering a "modified" torsional rigidity, with respect to a given function, and rearranging its layers to half-spaces, in a particular way; the Rayleigh quotient decreases with this procedure.
  We emphasize that the analogy of the Gaussian case with the Lebesgue case is not to be expected here, as in addition to some soft symmetrization ideas, the argument relies on the properties of some special functions; the fact that this analogy does hold is somewhat of a miracle.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness and exponential stability for Boussinesq systems on real hyperbolic Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and exponential decay of mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems in $L^p$-phase spaces on the framework of real hyperbolic manifold $\mathbb{H}^d(\mathbb{R})$, where $d \geqslant 2$ and $1&lt;p\leq d$. We consider a couple of Ebin-Marsden's Laplace and Laplace-Beltrami operators associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. Primarily, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the bounded mild solution for the linear system by using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup. Next, using the fixed point arguments, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to establish the existence of the bounded mild solutions. Due to Gronwall's inequality, we will clarify the exponential stability of such solutions. Finally, we give an application of stability to the existence of periodic mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems.</description>

Abstract: We prove $L^p$-$L^q$-estimates for the Restriction-Extension operator acting on block-radial functions with the aid of new oscillatory integral estimates and interpolation results in mixed Lorentz spaces. Similar techniques apply to the Limiting Absorption Principles for certain elliptic (pseudo-)differential operators with constant coefficients. In this way we obtain a richer existence theory for Helmholtz-type problems on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with block-radial right hand sides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o \cite{Kl-Ni} proved the stability of Minkowski in the case of the exterior of an outgoing null cone. Relying on the method used in \cite{Kl-Ni}, Caciotta and Nicol\`o \cite{Ca-Ni} proved the stability of Kerr spacetime in external regions, i.e. outside an outgoing null cone far away from the Kerr event horizon. In this paper, we give a new proof of \cite{Ca-Ni}. Compared to \cite{Ca-Ni}, we reduce the number of derivatives needed in the proof, simplify the treatment of the last slice, and provide a unified treatment of the decay of initial data which contains in particular the initial data considered by Klainerman and Szeftel in \cite{KS:main}. Also, concerning the treatment of curvature estimates, similar to \cite{ShenMink}, we replace the vectorfield method used in \cite{Kl-Ni,Ca-Ni} by $r^p$-weighted estimates introduced by Dafermos and Rodnianski in \cite{Da-Ro}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a natural biharmonic analogue of the classical Alt-Caffarelli problem, both under Dirichlet and under Navier boundary conditions. We show existence, basic properties and $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of minimisers. For the Navier problem we also obtain a symmetry result in case that the boundary data are radial. We find this remarkable because the problem under investigation is of higher order. Computing radial minimisers explicitly we find that the obtained regularity is optimal.</description>

Abstract: Let $f\in W^{3,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)$ be a function defined on a connected open subset $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R^2$. We will show that its graph is contained in a quadratic surface if and only if $f$ is a weak solution to a certain system of \nth{3} order partial differential equations unless the Hessian determinant of $f$ is non-positive on the whole $\Omega$. Moreover, we will prove that the system is in some sense the simplest possible in a wide class of differential equations, which will lead to the classification of all polynomial partial differential equations satisfied by parametrizations of generic quadratic surfaces. Although we will mainly use the tools of linear and commutative algebra, the theorem itself is also somehow related to holomorphic functions.</description>

      <title>The fine structure of the singular set of area-minimizing integral currents II: rectifiability of flat singular points with singularity degree larger than $1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an area-minimizing integral current $T$ of codimension higher than $1$ in a smooth Riemannian manifold $\Sigma$. In a previous paper we have subdivided the set of interior singular points with at least one flat tangent cone according to a real parameter, which we refer to as ``singularity degree''. This parameter determines the infinitesimal order of contact at the point in question between the ``singular part'' of $T$ and its ``best regular approximation''. In this paper we show that the set of points for which the singularity degree is strictly larger than $1$, is $(m-2)$-rectifiable. In a subsequent work we prove that the remaining flat singular points form an $(m-2)$-null set, thus concluding that the singular set of $T$ is $m-2$-rectifiable.</description>

Abstract: Given a bounded smooth domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we study the following anisotropic elliptic problem $$ \begin{cases} -\nabla\big(a(x)\nabla \upsilon\big)= a(x)\big[e^{\upsilon}-s\phi_1-4\pi\alpha\delta_q-h(x)\big]\,\,\,\, \,\textrm{in}\,\,\,\,\,\Omega,\\[2mm] \upsilon=0 \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad \textrm{on}\,\ \,\partial\Omega, \end{cases} $$ where $a(x)$ is a positive smooth function, $s&gt;0$ is a large parameter, $h\in C^{0,\gamma}(\overline{\Omega})$, $q\in\Omega$, $\alpha\in(-1,+\infty)\setminus\mathbb{N}$, $\delta_q$ denotes the Dirac measure with pole at point $q$ and $\phi_1$ is a positive first eigenfunction of the problem $-\nabla\big(a(x)\nabla \phi\big)=\lambda a(x)\phi$ under Dirichlet boundary condition in $\Omega$. We show that if $q$ is both a local maximum point of $\phi_1$ and an isolated local maximum point of $a(x)\phi_1$, this problem has a family of solutions $\upsilon_s$ with arbitrary $m$ bubbles accumulating to $q$ and the quantity $\int_{\Omega}a(x)e^{\upsilon_s}\rightarrow8\pi(m+1+\alpha)a(q)\phi_1(q)$ as $s\rightarrow+\infty$, which give a positive answer to the Lazer-McKenna conjecture for this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>

Abstract: We give a precise microlocal description of the singular profile that forms in the long-time propagation of internal waves in an effectively two-dimensional aquarium. We allow domains with corners, such as polygons appearing in the experimental set ups of Maas et al. This extends the previous work of Dyatlov--Wang--Zworski arXiv:2112.10191, which considered domains with smooth boundary. We show that in addition to singularities that correspond to attractors in the underlying classical dynamics, milder singularities propagate out of the corners as well.</description>

      <title>New Regularity Criteria for Navier-Stokes and SQG Equations in Critical Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some priori estimates to provide the critical regularity criteria for incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and super critical surface quasi-geostrophic equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$. Concerning the Navier-Stokes equation, we demonstrate that a Leray-Hopf solution $u$ is regular if $u\in L_T^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}} \dot{B}^{-\alpha}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, or $u$ in Lorentz space $ L_T^{p,r} \dot{B}^{-1+\frac{2}{p}}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, with $4\leq p\leq r&lt;\infty$. Additionally, an alternative regularity condition is expressed as $u\in L_{T}^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}
  \dot{B}^{-\alpha}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)+{L_T^\infty\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$($\alpha\in(0,1)$), contingent upon a smallness assumption on the norm $L_T^\infty\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$. For the SQG equation, we derive that a Leray-Hopf weak solution $\theta\in L_T^{\frac{\alpha}{\varepsilon}} \dot{C}^{1-\alpha+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is smooth for any $\varepsilon$ small enough. Similar to the case of Navier-Stokes equation, we derive regularity criterion in more refined spaces, i.e. Lorentz spaces $L_T^{\frac{\alpha}{\epsilon},r}\dot{C}^{1-\alpha+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and addition of two critical spaces $L_{T}^{\frac{\alpha}{\epsilon}}\dot{C}^{1-\alpha+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^2)+{L_T^\infty\dot{C}^{1-\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^2)}$, with smallness assumption on $L_T^\infty\dot{C}^{1-\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nonvariational setting for the Neumann problem for harmonic functions that are H\"{o}lder continuous and that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. Then we introduce a space of distributions on the boundary (a space of first order traces for H\"{o}lder continuous harmonic functions), we analyze the properties of the corresponding distributional single layer potential and we prove a representation theorem for harmonic H\"{o}lder continuous functions in terms of distributional single layer potentials. As an application, we solve the interior and exterior Neumann problem with distributional data in the space of first order traces that has been introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systems of the differential inequalities $$
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;
  - \operatorname{div} A_1 (x, \nabla u_1)
  \ge
  F_1 (x, u_2)
  &amp;
  \mbox{in } {\mathbb R}^n,
  &amp;
  - \operatorname{div} A_2 (x, \nabla u_2)
  \ge
  F_2 (x, u_1)
  &amp;
  \mbox{in } {\mathbb R}^n,
  \end{aligned}
  \right. $$ where $n \ge 2$ and $A_i$ are Caratheodory functions such that $$
  C_1
  |\xi|^{p_i}
  \le
  \xi
  A_i (x, \xi),
  \quad
  |A_i (x, \xi)|
  \le
  C_2
  |\xi|^{p_i - 1},
  \quad i = 1,2, $$ with some constants $C_1, C_2 &gt; 0$ and $p_1, p_2 &gt; 1$ for almost all $x \in {\mathbb R}^n$ and for all $\xi \in {\mathbb R}^n$, $n \ge 2$. For non-negative solutions of these systems we obtain exact blow-up conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness and Orbital Stability of Slow and Fast Solitary Wave Solutions of the Benjamin Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of existence and properties of solitary waves of the Benjamin equation. The studied equation includes a parameter $\gamma$ in front of the Benjamin-Ono term. We show the existence, uniqueness, decay and orbital stability of solitary wave solutions obtained as a solution to a certain minimization problem, associated either with high speeds without a sign condition on the parameter $\gamma$ or with low speeds for the appropriate sign.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. The existence and uniqueness of a spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, is first proved by I. Hashimoto and A. Matsumura in 2021. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. Moreover, we also derive a set of decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the long time stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ under small initial perturbations using the energy method. The main difficulty for this is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Local solution to an energy critical 2-D stochastic wave equation with exponential nonlinearity in a bounded domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.08123v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and the uniqueness of a local maximal solution to an $H^1$-critical stochastic wave equation with multiplicative noise on a smooth bounded domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with exponential nonlinearity. First, we derive the appropriate deterministic and stochastic Strichartz inequalities in suitable spaces and, then use them in arguments based on fixed point method to show the local well-posedness result. We also present an explosion result for the constructed unique local maximal solution.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantisation of Yang-Mills-Higgs in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a state space and a Markov process associated to the stochastic quantisation equation of Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) theories. The state space $\mathcal{S}$ is a nonlinear metric space of distributions, elements of which can be used as initial conditions for the (deterministic and stochastic) YMH flow with good continuity properties. Using gauge covariance of the deterministic YMH flow, we extend gauge equivalence $\sim$ to $\mathcal{S}$ and thus define a quotient space of "gauge orbits" $\mathfrak{O}$. We use the theory of regularity structures to prove local in time solutions to the renormalised stochastic YMH flow. Moreover, by leveraging symmetry arguments in the small noise limit, we show that there is a unique choice of renormalisation counterterms such that these solutions are gauge covariant in law. This allows us to define a canonical Markov process on $\mathfrak{O}$ (up to a potential finite time blow-up) associated to the stochastic YMH flow.</description>

Abstract: We establish the two-term spectral asymptotics for boundary value problems of linear elasticity on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimension. We also present some illustrative examples and give a historical overview of the subject. In particular, we correct erroneous results published in [J. Geom.

      <title>The Lorentzian scattering rigidity problem and rigidity of stationary metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scattering rigidity in Lorentzian geometry: recovery of a Lorentzian metric from the scattering relation $\mathcal{S}^\sharp$ known on a lateral boundary. We show that, under a non-conjugacy assumption, every defining function $r(x,y)$ of pairs of boundary points which can be connected by a lightlike geodesic plays the role of the boundary distance function in the Riemannian case in the following sense. Its linearization is the light ray transform of tensor fields of order two which are the perturbations of the metric. Next, we study scattering rigidity of stationary metrics in time-space cylinders and show that it can be reduced to boundary rigidity of magnetic systems on the base; a problem studied previously. This implies several scattering rigidity results for stationary metrics.</description>

      <title>On posterior consistency of data assimilation with Gaussian process priors: the 2D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-linear Bayesian data assimilation model for the periodic two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with initial condition modelled by a Gaussian process prior. We show that if the system is updated with sufficiently many discrete noisy measurements of the velocity field, then the posterior distribution eventually concentrates near the ground truth solution of the time evolution equation, and in particular that the initial condition is recovered consistently by the posterior mean vector field. We further show that the convergence rate can in general not be faster than inverse logarithmic in sample size, but describe specific conditions on the initial conditions when faster rates are possible. In the proofs we provide an explicit quantitative estimate for backward uniqueness of solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>A convergence result of a continuous model of deep learning via \L{}ojasiewicz--Simon inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a Wasserstein-type gradient flow, which represents an optimization process of a continuous model of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). First, we establish the existence of a minimizer for an average loss of the model under $L^2$-regularization. Subsequently, we show the existence of a curve of maximal slope of the loss. Our main result is the convergence of flow to a critical point of the loss as time goes to infinity. An essential aspect of proving this result involves the establishment of the \L{}ojasiewicz--Simon gradient inequality for the loss. We derive this inequality by assuming the analyticity of NNs and loss functions. Our proofs offer a new approach for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of Wasserstein-type gradient flows for nonconvex functionals.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of a scheme to obtain approximate weak solutions to the (inviscid) Burgers equation in conservation and Hamilton-Jacobi form, treated as degenerate elliptic problems. We show different variants recover non-unique weak solutions as appropriate, and also specific constructive approaches to recover the corresponding entropy solutions.</description>

      <title>Large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of $N_{\infty}$-soliton solutions (soliton gas) for the focusing Hirota equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hirota equation is one of the integrable higher-order extensions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and can describe the ultra-short optical pulse propagation in the form $iq_t+\alpha(q_{xx}+ 2|q|^2q)+i\beta (q_{xxx}+ 6|q|^2q_x)=0,\, (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\, (\alpha,\,\beta\in\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we analytically explore the asymptotic behaviors of a soliton gas for the Hirota equation including the complex modified KdV equation, in which the soliton gas is regarded as the limit $N\to \infty$ of $N$-soliton solutions, and characterized using the Riemann-Hilbert problem with discrete spectra restricted in the intervals $(ia, ib)\cup (-ib, -ia)\, (0&lt;a&lt;b)$. We find that this soliton gas tends slowly to the Jaocbian elliptic wave solution with an error $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-1})$ (zero exponentially quickly ) as $x\to -\infty$ ($x\to +\infty$). We also present the long-time asymptotics of the soliton gas under the different velocity conditions: $x/t&gt;4\beta b^2,\, \xi_c&lt;x/t&lt;4\beta b^2,\, x/t&lt;\xi_c$. Moreover, we analyze the property of the soliton gas for the case of the discrete spectra filling uniformly a quadrature domain.</description>
