      <title>Multimode vibrational coupling across the insulator-to-metal transition in 1T-TaS$_{2}$ in THz cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of optical cavities on resonance with material excitations allows controlling light-matter interaction in both the regimes of weak and strong coupling. We study here the multimode vibrational coupling of low energy phonons in the charge-density-wave material 1T-TaS$_{2}$ across its insulator-to-metal phase transition. For this purpose, we embed 1T-TaS$_{2}$ into THz Fabry-P\'erot cryogenic cavities tunable in frequency within the spectral range of the vibrational modes of the insulating phase and track the linear response of the coupled phonons across the insulator-to-metal transition. In the low temperature dielectric state, we reveal the signatures of a multimode vibrational strong collective coupling. The observed polariton modes inherit character from all the vibrational resonances as a consequence of the cavity-mediated hybridization. We reveal that the vibrational strong collective coupling is suppressed across the insulator-to-metal transition as a consequence of the phonon-screening induced by the free charges. Our findings emphasize how the response of cavity-coupled vibrations can be modified by the presence of free charges, uncovering a new direction toward the tuning of coherent light-matter interaction in cavity-confined correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Universal Vibrational Anharmonicity in Carbyne-like Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbyne, an infinite linear chain of carbon atoms, is the truly one-dimensional allotrope of carbon. While ideal carbyne and its fundamental properties have remained elusive, carbyne-like materials like carbyne chains confined inside carbon nanotubes are available for study. Here, we probe the longitudinal optical phonon (C-mode) of confined carbyne chains by Raman spectroscopy up to the third overtone. We observe a strong vibrational anharmonicity that increases with decreasing C-mode frequency, reaching up to 8% for the third overtone. Moreover, we find that the relation between vibrational anharmonicity and C-mode frequency is universal to carbyne-like materials, including ideal carbyne. This establishes experimentally that carbyne and related materials have pronounced anharmonic potential landscapes which must be included in the theoretical description of their structure and properties.</description>

      <title>BEACON -- Automated Aberration Correction for Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy using Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aberration correction is an important aspect of modern high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Most methods of aligning aberration correctors require specialized sample regions and are unsuitable for fine-tuning aberrations without interrupting on-going experiments. Here, we present an automated method of correcting first- and second-order aberrations called BEACON which uses Bayesian optimization of the normalized image variance to efficiently determine the optimal corrector settings. We demonstrate its use on gold nanoparticles and a hafnium dioxide thin film showing its versatility in nano- and atomic-scale experiments. BEACON can correct all first- and second-order aberrations simultaneously to achieve an initial alignment and first- and second-order aberrations independently for fine alignment. Ptychographic reconstructions are used to demonstrate an improvement in probe shape and a reduction in the target aberration.</description>

      <title>Giant Topological Hall Effect in Magnetic Weyl Metal Mn$_{2}$Pd$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy between real and reciprocal space topology is anticipated to yield a diverse array of topological properties in quantum materials. We address this pursuit by achieving topologically safeguarded magnetic order in novel Weyl metallic Heusler alloy, Mn$_{2}$Pd$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. The system possesses non-centrosymmetric D$_{2d}$ crystal symmetry with notable spin-orbit coupling effects. Our first principles calculations confirm the topological non-trivial nature of band structure, including 42 pairs of Weyl nodes at/near the Fermi level, offering deeper insights into the observed anomalous Hall effect mediated by intrinsic Berry curvature. A unique canted magnetic ordering facilitates such rich topological features, manifesting through an exceptionally large topological Hall effect at low fields. The latter is sustained even at room temperature and compared with other known topological magnetic materials. Detailed micromagnetic simulations demonstrate the possible existence of an antiskyrmion lattice. Our results underscore the $D_{2d}$ Heusler magnets as a possible platform to explore the intricate interplay of non-trivial topology across real and reciprocal spaces to leverage a plethora of emergent properties for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Accounting all contributions for the Van Vleck paramagnetism and the Langevin diamagnetism from first principles: application to diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general method for calculating magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) in dielectrics within a single choice of magnetic gauge for the whole crystal is presented. On the basis of the method, accounting for all contributions to the Van Vleck paramagnetism and Langevin (Larmore) diamagnetism, a full-scale ab initio calculation of $\chi$ in diamond is performed. Unfamiliar contributions to $\chi$ includes a Van Vleck contribution from the interstitial region and an offset contribution from the muffin-tin (MT) sphere, appearing due to the change of the MT-sphere magnetic moment when the sphere is displaced from the origin. Although the Langevin diamagnetism explicitly depends on the choice of the origin, its sum with the Van Vleck term remains invariant, which is demonstrated on the basis of the gauge invariance of the magnetic vector potential. The derived expressions have been applied to ab initio calculations of magnetic susceptibility of the crystalline diamond within the linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW). With the diamond unit cell having the inversion symmetry, the magnetic (Van Vleck) calculations require the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone accounting for half of the whole zone, i.e. 24 times larger than that in the absence of magnetic field. Investigating possible anisotropy of $\chi$, we calculate it for 74 different directions of H (belonging to Lebedev surface grid points), and demonstrate that the actual value of $\chi$ remain isotropic. The obtained volume magnetic susceptibility in diamond lies in the range $16.27-16.72 (with the Langevin contribution -39.22-39.94 and the Van Vleck contribution -22.94-23.22), in units 10^{-7}, which compares well with the experimental data and other calculations.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale Nucleation and Growth Pathway of Complex Plate-like Precipitates in Aluminum Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum alloys, the most widely utilized lightweight structural materials, predominantly depend on coherent complex-structured nano-plates to enhance their mechanical properties. Despite several decades of research, the atomic-scale nucleation and growth pathways for these complex-structured nano-plates remain elusive, as probing and simulating atomic events like solid nucleation is prohibitively challenging. Here, using theoretical calculations and focus on three representative complex-structured nano-plates in commercial Al alloys, we explicitly demonstrate their associated structural transitions follow an inter-layer-sliding+shuffling mode. Specifically, partial dislocations complete the inter-layer-sliding stage, while atomic shuffling occurs upon forming the unstable basic structural transformation unit of the nano-plates. By identifying these basic structural transformation units, we propose structural evolution pathways for these nano-plates within the Al matrix, which align well with experimental observations and enable the evaluation of critical nuclei. These findings provide long-sought mechanistic details into how coherent nano-plates nucleate and grow, facilitating the rational design of higher-performance Al alloys and other structural materials.</description>

      <title>Inter-Cation Charge Transfer Mediated Antiferromagnetism in Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$S$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetism in transition metal compounds is mostly mediated by the bridging anions through a so-called superexchange mechanism. However, in materials like normal spinels $AB_2X_4$ with local moments only at the $A$ site, such an anion-mediated superexchange needs to be modified. Here we report a new spinel compound Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$S$_4$ ($x$ = 0.3). The physical property measurements strongly suggest an antiferromagnetic-like transition at 292 K in the Co($A$) diamond sublattice. The first-principle calculations reveal that the nearest-neighbor Co($A$) spins align antiferromagnetically with an ordered magnetic moment of 1.67 $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, smaller than the expected $S = 3/2$ for Co$^{2+}$. In the antiferromagnetic state, there exists an inter-cation charge-transfer gap between the non-bonding Ir-$t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbitals at the valence band maximum and the Co-S antibonding molecular orbitals at the conduction band minimum. The small charge transfer energy significantly enhances the virtual hopping between these two states, facilitating a robust long-range superexchange interaction between two neighboring CoS$_4$ complexes, which accounts for the high N\'{e}el temperature in Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$S$_4$. This inter-cation charge transfer mediated magnetic interaction expands the traditional superexchange theory, which could be applicable in complex magnetic materials with multiple cations.</description>

      <title>Li$_{14}$Mn$_{2}$S$_{9}$ and Li$_{10}$Si$_{2}$S$_{9}$ as a pair of all-electrochem-active electrode and solid-state electrolyte with chemical compatibility and low interface resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid-state batteries (SSBs), improving the physical contact at the electrode-electrolyte interface is essential for achieving better performance and durability. On the one hand, it is necessary to look for solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity and no reaction with the electrode, on the other hand, to design the all-electrochem-active (AEA) electrodes that contain no SSEs and other non-active substances. In this work, we proposed a pair of AEA-electrode and SSE with the same structural framework and excellent interface compatibility, Li$_{14}$Mn$_{2}$S$_{9}$ and Li$_{10}$Si$_{2}$S$_{9}$, and confirmed the feasibility by ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and machine learning interatomic potential based molecular dynamics (MLIP-based MD) simulations, providing a new approach to promote interfacial stability in SSBs.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of palladium hydride via ionic gate-driven protonation using a deep eutectic solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing novel protocols for hydrogen (H) loading is crucial for furthering the investigation of hydrides as potential high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures compared to recent discoveries. Ionic gating-induced protonation (IGP) has emerged as a promising technique for H loading due to its inherent simplicity, but it can be limited in the maximum density of injected H when ionic liquids are used as a gating medium. Here, we demonstrate that large H concentrations can be successfully injected in both palladium (Pd) bulk foils and thin films (up to a stoichiometry PdH$_{0.89}$) by using a choline chloride-glycerol deep eutectic solvent (DES) as gate electrolyte and applying gate voltages in excess of the cathodic stability limit. The attained H concentrations are large enough to induce superconductivity in Pd, albeit with an incomplete resistive transition which suggests a strongly inhomogeneous H incorporation in the Pd matrix. This DES-based IGP protocol can be used as a guideline for maximizing H loading in different materials, although specific details of the applied voltage profile might require adjustments based on the material under investigation.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature fabrication of amorphous carbon films as a universal template for remote epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the low-temperature fabrication (300$\deg$C) of ultrathin 2D amorphous carbon layers on III-V semiconductors by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition as a universal template for remote epitaxy. We present growth and detailed characterization of 2D amorphous carbon layers on various host substrates and their subsequent remote epitaxial overgrowth by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy. We present the fabrication of ultra-smooth monolayer thick amorphous carbon layers with roughness $\leq 0.3$ nm determined by atomic-force microscopy and X-ray reflectivity measurement. We show that precisely tailoring the carbon layer thickness allows superior tunability of the substrate-layer interaction. Further, X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal predominantly sp$^2$-hybridised carbon in the amorphous layers. We observe that a low-temperature nucleation step is favorable for nucleation of III-V material growth on substrates coated with thin amorphous carbon layers. Under optimized preparation conditions, we obtain high-quality, single-crystalline, (001)-oriented GaAs, cubic-AlN, cubic-GaN and In(x)Ga(1-x)As, respectively, and various carbon-coated (001)-oriented substrates as GaAs, InP and 3C-SiC. Transmission electron microscopy images of the substrate-carbon-layer interface reveal a stretching of the atomic bonds at the interface and high-resolution X-ray diffraction measurements reveal high crystal quality and low dislocation densities $&lt;1\times 10^7 \text{cm}^{-2}$. Our results show the universality of our carbon deposition process to fabricate templates for remote epitaxy, e. g., for remote epitaxy on temperature sensitive substrates like GaAs or InP and growth of metastable phases. Lift-off of layers from their substrates is demonstrated by employing a Ni stressor.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Disorder in the Mesophase Ferroelectric HdabcoClO4: A Machine-Learned Force Field Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid molecular ferroelectrics with orientationally disordered mesophases offer significant promise as lead-free alternatives to traditional inorganic ferroelectrics owing to properties such as room temperature ferroelectricity, low-energy synthesis, malleability, and potential for multiaxial polarization. The ferroelectric molecular salt HdabcoClO4 is of particular interest due to its ultrafast ferroelectric room-temperature switching. However, so far, there is limited understanding of the nature of dynamical disorder arising in these compounds. Here, we employ the neural network NeuralIL to train a machine-learned force field (MLFF) with training data generated using density functional theory. The resulting MLFF-MD simulations exhibit phase transitions and thermal expansion in line with earlier reported experimental results, for both a low-temperature phasetransition coinciding with the orientational disorder of ClO4- molecules and the onset of rotation of Hdabco+ and ClO4- molecules in a high-temperature phase transition. We also find proton transfer even in the low-temperature phase, which increases with temperature and leads to associated proton disorder as well as the onset of disorder in the direction of the hydrogen-bonded chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with an ultrahigh theoretical energy density have attracted more and more attentions for their crucial applications of portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and smart grids. However, the implementation of LMBs in practice is still facing numerous challenges, such as low Coulombic e ciency, poor cycling performance, and complicated interfacial reactions. First-principles calculations have become a powerful technique in lithium battery research eld, in terms of modeling the structures and properties of speci c electrode materials, understanding the charge/discharge mechanisms at the atomic scale, and delivering rational design strategies for electrode materials as well as electrolytes. In this review, theoretical studies on sulfur cathodes, oxygen cathodes, lithium metal anodes, and solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) of LMBs are summarized. A brief introduction of simulation methods is o ered at rst. The next two chapters mainly focus on issues concerning cathodes of LMBs. Then the theoretical researches on the Li metal anode and SSEs are particularly reviewed. The current challenges and potential research directions in each field of LMBs are prospected from a theoretical viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect of Fe47.5Ni37.5Mn15 bulk and nanoparticles: A cost-efficient alloy for room temperature magnetic refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of magnetic refrigerators that operate at room temperature without the use of environmentally harmful substances represents a significant advancement in eco-friendly technology. These refrigerators employ the magnetocaloric effect (MCE), which has traditionally been achieved using expensive rare-earth elements such as gadolinium. To facilitate cost-effective commercialization, it is essential to investigate alternative materials, such as transition metal alloys. In this study, an Fe47.5Ni37.5Mn15 alloy, which has a Curie temperature that is close to room temperature, is cast, and the alloy exhibits a noteworthy cooling power of 297.68 J/kg, which makes it good for cost-effective applications. To further enhance MCE performance through super-paramagnetism (e.g. size reduction), nanoparticles of the same composition are synthesized using a top-down approach via pulsed-laser ablation in ethanol. However, these nanoparticles do not exhibit a Curie temperature near room temperature, likely due to significant carbon incorporation during synthesis, which adversely affected their magnetocaloric properties. This study underscores the potential of transition metal alloys for magnetic refrigeration and highlights the need for optimized synthesis methods to achieve desired thermal properties in nanoparticulate form.</description>

      <title>Highly Transparent Lead-Free Piezoelectric Haptic Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic haptic technology adds touch sensations to human-machine interfaces by integrating piezoelectric actuators onto touchscreens. Traditional piezoelectric haptic technologies use opaque lead-containing ceramics that are both toxic and visible. We have developed a highly transparent lead-free piezoelectric haptic device using potassium sodium niobate (KNN) and transparent conductive oxide thin films. The KNN film, grown on glass, exhibits a pure perovskite phase and a dense microstructure. This device achieves up to 80% transmittance, surpassing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. It generates an acoustic resonance at 16.5 kHz and produces a peak-to-peak displacement of 1.0 um at 28 V unipolar, making it suitable for surface rendering applications. This demonstrates the potential of transparent lead-free piezoelectric actuators as an effective alternative to conventional PZT haptic actuators.</description>

      <title>Controlling Orbital Ordering of Intergrowth Structures with Flat [Ag(II)F2] Layers to Mimic Oxocuprates(II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Density Functional Theory calculations, we propose a new pathway toward compounds featuring flat [AgF2] layers which mimic [CuO2] layers in high-temperature oxocuprate superconductor precursors. Calculations predict the dynamic (phonon) and energetic stability of the new phases over diverse substrates. For some compounds with ferro orbital ordering, we find a gigantic intrasheet superexchange constant of up to minus 211 meV (DFT+U) and minus 256 meV (SCAN), calculated for hypothetical (CsMgF3)2KAgF3 intergrowth. Semiempirical calculations show that at optimum doping, the expected superconducting critical temperature should reach 200 K. The partial substitution of K+ with Ba2+ leads to noticeable electron doping of [AgF2] sublattice, as revealed by progressive population of the Upper-Hubbard band. On the other hand, modest 10 to 15% hole-doping through partial substitution of Mg2+ with Li+, primarily leads to the depopulation of p(z) orbitals of apical F atoms. We also find structures with an undesired antiferrodistortive structural ordering and discuss the structural factors that determine the transition from buckled to flat planes and from different types of orbital ordering using Landau theory of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Automated Workflow for Accurate High-Throughput GW Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GW approximation represents the state-of-the-art ab-initio method for computing excited-state properties. Its execution requires control over a larger number of (often interdependent) parameters, and therefore its application in high-throughput studies is hindered by the intricate and time-consuming convergence process across a multi-dimensional parameter space. To address these challenges, here we develop a fully-automated open-source workflow for G$_0$W$_0$ calculations within the AiiDA-VASP plugin architecture. The workflow is based on an efficient estimation of the errors on the quasi-particle (QP) energies due to basis-set truncation and the pseudo-potential norm violation, which allows a reduction of the dimensionality of the parameter space and avoids the need for multi-dimensional convergence searches. Protocol validation is conducted through a systematic comparison against established experimental and state-of-the-art GW data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we construct a database of QP energies for a diverse dataset of over 320 bulk structures. The openly accessible workflow and resulting dataset can serve as a valuable resource and reference for conducting accurate data-driven research.</description>

      <title>Coexistent Topological and Chiral Phonons in Chiral RhGe: An ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CoSi-family of materials hosts unconventional multifold chiral fermions, such as spin-1 and spin-3/2 fermions, leading to intriguing phenomena like long Fermi arc surface states and exotic transport properties, as shown by electronic structure calculations. Recent interest on the phonon behavior in chiral materials is growing in condensed matter physics due to their unique characteristics, including topological phonons, protected surface states and the chiral nature of phonons with non-zero angular momentum. This chiral behavior also enables phonon modes to generate magnetic moments. Therefore, investigating the chiral phonon behavior in chiral CoSi-family materials could provide innovative opportunities in the development of phononic devices. In this study, we explore the topological and chiral phonon behavior in chiral RhGe using first-principles calculations. RhGe hosts multiple double-Weyl points in both its acoustic and optical phonon branches, including spin-1 Weyl points at the $\Gamma$ point and charge-2 Dirac points at the R point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). The topological nature of the phonons in RhGe is revealed by the presence of topologically protected nontrivial phonon surface states and corresponding iso-frequency contours observed in the (001) and (111) surface BZ. Furthermore, phonon angular momentum calculations confirm the chiral nature of phonons in RhGe, with some phonon modes exhibiting finite magnetic moments. Our findings thus indicate that the coexistence of topological and chiral phonon modes in chiral RhGe not only deepens our understanding of the phonon behavior in chiral CoSi-family but also opens new pathways for developing advanced materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Discovery of Extreme Lattice Thermal Conductivity by Crystal Attention Graph Neural Network (CATGNN) Using Chemical Bonding Intuitive Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for technologically promising crystalline materials with desired thermal transport properties requires an electronic level comprehension of interatomic interactions and chemical intuition to uncover the hidden structure-property relationship. Here, we propose two chemical bonding descriptors, namely negative normalized integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (normalized -ICOHP) and normalized integrated crystal orbital bond index (normalized ICOBI) and unravel their strong correlation to both lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) and rattling effect characterized by mean squared displacement (MSD). Our new descriptors outperform empirical models and the sole -ICOHP quantity in closely relating to extreme LTCs by testing on a first-principles dataset of over 4,500 materials with 62 distinct species. The Pearson correlation of both descriptors with LTC are significantly higher in magnitude compared with the traditional simple rule of average mass. We further develop crystal attention graph neural networks (CATGNN) model and predict our proposed descriptors of ~200,000 materials from existing databases to screen potentially ultralow and high LTC materials. We select 367 (533) with low (high) normalized -ICOHP and ICOBI for first-principles validation. The validation shows that 106 dynamically stable materials with low normalized -ICOHP and ICOBI have LTC less than 5 W/mK, among which 68% are less than 2 W/mK, while 13 stable materials with high normalized -ICOHP and ICOBI possess LTC higher than 100 W/mK. The proposed normalized -ICOHP and normalized ICOBI descriptors offer deep insights into LTC and MSD from chemical bonding principles. Considering the cheap computational cost, these descriptors offer a new reliable and fast route for high-throughput screening of novel crystalline materials with extreme LTCs for applications such as thermoelectrics and electronic cooling.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Ferroelectric-Like Behavior in Leaky Dielectrics: A Microscopic Model for Polarization Dynamics and Hysteresis Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can arise solely from energy and voltage polarity-dependent transport and asymmetries in the transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our findings offer valuable perspectives for applications in capacitors, transistors, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Undulated 2D materials as a platform for large Rashba spin-splitting and persistent spin-helix states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with large unidirectional Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), resulting in persistent-spin helix states with small spin-precession length, are critical for advancing spintronics. We demonstrate a design principle achieving it through specific undulations of 2D materials. Analytical model and first-principles calculations reveal that bending-induced asymmetric hybridization brings about and even enhances Rashba SOC. Its strength $\alpha_R \propto \kappa$ (curvature) and shifting electronic levels $\Delta \propto \kappa^2$. Despite the vanishing integral curvature of typical topographies, implying a net-zero Rashba effect, our two-band analysis and electronic structure calculation of a bent 2D MoTe$_2$ show that only an interplay of $\alpha_R$ and $\Delta$ modulations results in large unidirectional Rashba SOC with well-isolated states. Their high spin-splitting $\sim 0.16$ eV, and attractively small spin-precession length $\sim 1$ nm, are among the best known. Our work uncovers major physical effects of undulations on Rashba SOC in 2D materials, opening new avenues for using their topographical deformation for spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Cobalt-Based Pyroxenes: A New Playground for Kitaev Physics and Ising Model Realization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13550v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the study of cobaltites have unveiled their potential as a promising platform for realizing Kitaev physics in honeycomb systems and the Ising model in weakly coupled chain materials. In this manuscript, we explore the magnetic properties of pyroxene SrCoGe$_2$O$_6$ using a combination of neutron scattering, {\it ab initio} methods, and linear spin-wave theory. Through careful examination of inelastic neutron scattering powder spectra, we propose a modified Kitaev model to accurately describe the twisted chains of edge-sharing octahedra surrounding Co$^{2+}$ ions. The extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model, including a significant anisotropic bond-dependent exchange term with $K/|J|=0.96$, is identified as the key descriptor of the magnetic interactions in SrCoGe$_2$O$_6$. Furthermore, our heat capacity measurements reveal an effect of an external magnetic field (approximately 13~T) which shifts the system from a fragile antiferromagnetic ordering with $T_{\mathrm{N}}=9$~K to a field-induced state. We argue that pyroxenes, particularly those modified by substituting Ge with Si and its less extended $p$ orbitals, emerge as a novel platform for the Kitaev model. This opens up possibilities for advancing our understanding of Kitaev physics.</description>

      <title>Coarse grained modeling of a metal-organic framework/polymer composite and its gas adsorption at the nanoparticle level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations have acted as a cornerstone to understand MOF/polymer interface structure, however, no molecular-level simulation has yet been performed at the nanoparticle scale. In this work, a hybrid MARTINI/Force Matching (FM) force field was developed and successfully implemented to model the ZIF-8/PVDF composite at a coarse grained resolution. Inter-phase interactions were modeled using FM potentials, which strive to reasonably reproduce the forces from an atomistic benchmark model, while intraphase interactions are modeled using the general-purpose MARTINI potentials. Systems made of a ZIF-8 nanoparticle embedded into a PVDF matrix were considered to evaluate the effect of nanoparticle size and morphology in the polymer structure and in the CO2 adsorption. Results show that simulations at the nanoparticle level are crucial for depicting the polymer penetration. Notably, the smallest nanoparticle exhibited the least extent of polymer penetration, while the cubic nanoparticle exhibited the highest amount. Polymer conformation and local density values change similarly in all ZIF-8/PVDF systems depending on whether the polymer lies inside or outside of the nanoparticle domain. All composite models present more significant CO2 adsorption in the nanoparticle domain than in the PVDF phase, in agreement with experiments. More remarkably, the small rhombic dodecahedron ZIF-8/PVDF system presents a larger equilibrium amount of gas adsorbed at ambient condition compared to the other two systems, in alignment with the observed polymer penetration trend. On the other hand, the amount of CO2 adsorbed at equilibrium is lower for the rhombic dodecahedron morphology than for the cubic one, contrary to the intuitive expectation founded in the polymer penetration trend. This result could be a reflection of a difference in the number of surface adsorption sites.</description>

Abstract: Curved elastic shells can be fabricated through molding or by harnessing residual stresses. These shells often exhibit snap-through behavior and multistability when loaded. We present a unique way of fabricating curved elastic shells that exhibit multistability and snap-through behavior, weft-knitting. The knitting process introduces internal stresses into the textile sheet, which leads to complex 3D curvatures. We explore the relationship between the geometry and the mechanical response, identifying a parameter space where the textiles are multistable. We harness the snapping behavior and shape change through multistability to design soft conductive switches with built-in haptic feedback, and incorporate these textile switches into wearable devices. This work will allow us to harness the nonlinear mechanical behavior of textiles to create functional, soft, and seamless wearable devices. This includes but is not limited to the devices for additional cycling visibility and safety that we envision.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ligand vs. Linker on Phase Behavior and Mechanical Properties of Nanoparticle Gels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticle gels have attracted considerable attention due to their highly tunable properties. One strategy for producing nanoparticle gels involves utilizing strong local attractions between polymeric molecules, such as DNA hybridization or dynamic covalent chemistry, to form percolated nanoparticle networks. These molecules can be used in two distinct roles: as ``ligands'' with one end grafted to a nanoparticle or as ``linkers'' with both ends free. Here, we explore how these roles shape the phase behavior and mechanical properties of gel-like nanoparticle assemblies using coarse-grained simulations. We systematically vary the interaction strength and bending stiffness of both ligands and linkers. We find that phase separation can be limited to low nanoparticle volume fractions by making the ligands rigid, consistent with previous studies on linked nanoparticle gels. At fixed interaction strength and volume fraction, both ligand- and linker-mediated nanoparticle assemblies show similar mechanical responses to variations in bending stiffness. However, a comparison between the two association schemes reveals that the linked nanoparticles form rigid percolated networks that are less stretchable than the ligand-grafted gels, despite exhibiting similar tensile strength. We attribute these differences between ligands and linkers to the distinct structural arrangement of nanoparticles. Our findings highlight the potential to utilize different association schemes to tune specific mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Transport properties and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

      <title>Local Field Statistics in Linear Elastic Unidirectional Fibrous Composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical fluctuations of local tensorial fields beyond the mean are relevant to predict localized failure or overall behavior of the inelastic composites. The expression for second moments of the local fields can be established using Hill-Mandel condition. Complete estimation of statistical fluctuations via second moments is usually ignored despite its significance. In Eshelby-based mean-field approaches, the second moments are evaluated through derivatives of Hill's Polarization tensor $ \left ( \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}} \right )$ using a singular approximation. Typically, semi-analytical procedures using numerical integration are used to evaluate the derivatives of the polarization tensor $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}}$. Here, new analytically derived explicit expressions are presented for calculating the derivatives, specifically for unidirectional fibrous composites with isotropic phases. Full-field homogenization using finite element is used to compute the statistical distribution of local fields (exact solution) for the class of random fibrous microstructures. The mean-field estimates are validated with the exact solution across different fiber volume fractions and aspect ratios. The results indicate that the fiber volume fraction significantly influences the fluctuation of stress tensor invariants, whereas the aspect ratio has minimal effect.</description>

Abstract: Optimally designing molten salt applications requires knowledge of their thermophysical properties, but existing databases are incomplete, and experiments are challenging. Ideal mixing and Redlich-Kister models are computationally cheap but lack either accuracy or generality. To address this, a transfer learning approach using deep neural networks (DNNs) is proposed, combining Redlich-Kister models, experimental data, and ab initio properties. The approach predicts molten salt density with high accuracy ($r^{2}$ &gt; 0.99, MAPE &lt; 1%), outperforming the alternatives.</description>

Abstract: Graphene is a promising material for the development of applications in nanoelectronic devices, but the lack of a band gap necessitates the search for ways to tune its electronic properties. In addition to doping, defects, and nanoribbons, a more radical alternative is the development of 2D forms with structures that are in clear departure from the honeycomb lattice, such as graphynes, with the distinctive property of involving carbon atoms with both hybridizations sp and sp2. The density and details of how the acetylenic links are distributed allow for a variety of electronic signatures. Here we propose a graphyne system based on the recently synthesized biphenylene monolayer. We demonstrate that this system features highly localized states with a spin-polarized semiconducting configuration. We study its stability and show that the system's structural details directly influence its highly anisotropic electronic properties. Finally, we show that the symmetry of the frontier states can be further tuned by modulating the size of the acetylenic chains forming the system.</description>

      <title>Emerging quantum critical phase in a cluster spin-glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic frustration has been recognized as pivotal to investigating new phases of matter in correlation-driven Kondo breakdown quantum phase transitions that are not clearly associated with broken symmetry. The nature of these new phases, however, remains underexplored. Here, we report quantum criticalities emerging from a cluster spin-glass in the heavy-fermion metal TiFe$_x$Cu$_{2x-1}$Sb, where frustration originates from intrinsic disorder. Specific heat and magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter measurements under varying magnetic fields exhibit quantum critical scaling, indicating a quantum critical point near 0.13 Tesla. As the magnetic field increases, the cluster spin-glass phase is progressively suppressed. Upon crossing the quantum critical point, resistivity and Hall effect measurements reveal enhanced screening of local moments and an expanding Fermi surface, consistent with the Kondo breakdown scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using \emph{ab initio} band structure and DFT+dynamical mean-field theory methods we examine the effects of electron-electron interactions on the electronic structure, magnetic state, and structural phase stability of the recently discovered double-layer perovskite superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure. Our results show the emergence of a double spin-charge-density stripe state characterized by a wave vector ${\bf q}=(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4})$ arrangement of the nominally high-spin Ni$^{2+}_\mathrm{A}$ and low-spin Ni$^{3+}_\mathrm{B}$ ions (diagonal hole stripes oriented at $45^\circ$ to the Ni-O bond) which form zigzag ferromagnetic chains alternating in the $ab$ plane. The phase transition is accompanied by cooperative breathing-mode distortions of the lattice structure and leads to a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure and magnetic properties of LNO. We obtain a narrow-gap correlated insulator with a band gap value of $\sim$0.2 eV characterized by strong localization of the Ni $3d$ states and significant spin-orbital polarizations of the charge deficient Ni$^{3+}_\mathrm{B}$ ions. Our results suggest the importance of double exchange to determine the magnetic properties of LNO, similarly to that in charge-ordered manganites. We propose that spin and charge stripe fluctuations play an important role to tune superconductivity in LNO under pressure.</description>

      <title>The twisting dynamics of large lattice mismatch van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) homo-/hetero-structures are ideal systems for studying interfacial tribological properties such as structural superlubricity. Previous studies concentrated on the mechanism of translational motion in vdW interfaces. However, detailed mechanisms and general properties of the rotational motion are barely explored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to reveal the twisting dynamics of the MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure. Unlike the translational friction falling into the superlubricity regime with no twist angle dependence, the dynamic rotational resistances highly depend on twist angles. Our results show that the periodic rotational resistance force originates from structural potential energy changes during the twisting. The structural potential energy of MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure increases monotonically from0 to 30 degrees twist angles, and the estimated relative energy barrier is (1.43 +/- 0.36) x 10 J/m. The formation of Moir\'e superstructures in the graphene layer is the key to controlling the structural potential energy of the MoS$_2$/graphene heterostructure. Our results suggest that in twisting 2D heterostructures, even if the interface sliding friction is negligible, the evolving potential energy change results in a non-vanishing rotational resistance force. The structural change of the heterostructure can be an additional pathway for energy dissipation in the rotational motion, further enhancing the rotational friction force.</description>

      <title>Spin-layer coupling in altermagnets multilayer: a design principle for spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of collinear symmetric-compensated altermagnets (AM) with intrinsic spin splitting provides a route towards energy-efficient and ultrafast device applications. Here, using first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we propose a series of AM Cr2SX (X=O, S, Se) monolayer and explore the spin splitting in Cr2SX multilayer. A general design principle for realizing the spin-layer coupling in odd/even-layer is mapped out based on the comprehensive analysis of spin group symmetry. The spin splitting behavior related with the MzUt, Mz and ML symmetries in AM multilayer can be significantly modulated by magnetic orders, crystal symmetry and external perpendicular gate field (Ez). Due to the spin-compensated bands of sublayers linked by overall Mz and interlayers ML symmetries, the Cr2S2 odd-layer exhibits the unique coexistence of spin splitting and spin degeneracy at high symmetric paths and X/Y valley, respectively. Furthermore, owing to the higher priority of overall ML symmetry compared to interlayers ML symmetry in AM even-layer, the spin-layer coupling of AM multilayer shows strong odd/even-layer dependence. Our work not only offer a new direction for manipulating spin splitting, but also greatly enrich the research on AM monolayer and multilayer.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric Manipulation and Engineering for Layertronics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic transport characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) systems have widespread application prospects in the fabrication of multifunctional nanodevices. However, the current research for basic transport phenomena, such as anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) and piezoelectric response, is limited to discrete discussion. Here, we theoretically propose a valley-piezoelectricity coupling strategy beyond the existing paradigm to realize AVHE and layer Hall effect (LHE) in ferrovalley (FV) systems, and its essential principle can be extended to general valleytronic materials. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the large polarized electric field of 2.8*106 (1.67*107) V/m can be induced by 0.1% uniaxial strain in FV 2H-LaHF (1T-LaHF) monolayers. In addition, the microscopic mechanism of interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) state of 2H-LaHF bilayer is uncovered by the spin Hamiltonian and super-superexchange (SSE) interaction. Our findings pave the way for new explorations of valley Hall-related effect involving piezoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Possible way to achieve anomalous valley Hall effect by tunable intrinsic piezoelectric polarization in FeO$_2$SiGeN$_2$ monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley-related multiple Hall effect and piezoelectric response are novel transport characteristics in low-dimensional system, however few studies have reported their coexistence in a single system as well as their coupling relationships. By first-principles calculations, we propose a multifunctional Janus semiconductor, i.e. FeO$_2$SiGeN$_2$ monolayer with large valley polarization of about 120 meV and in-plane piezoelectric polarization with d11 of -0.714.03 pm/V. The magnetic anisotropy energy can be significantly regulated by electronic correlation strength and strain, which can be attributed to the change of competition relationship about Fe-3d-resolved magnetic anisotropy energy brought about by external regulatory means. Electronic correlation strength can induce phase transitions in Janus FeO$_2$SiGeN$_2$ monolayer from ferrovalley to quantum anomalous Hall phase, while the half-valley metallic state as the boundary of the phase transition can gererate 100% spin- and valley polarization. The related phase transition mechanism is analyzed based on the two-band strained kp model. The presence of piezoelectric strain coefficients d11 in valleytronic material makes the coupling between charge degrees of freedom and valley degrees of freedom possible, and the intrinsic electric field caused by the in-plane piezoelectric response provide the way to realize piezoelectric anomalous valley Hall effect. This work may pave a way to find a new member of materials with valley-related multiple Hall effect and stimulate further experimental works related to valleytronics and piezotronics.</description>

      <title>On the grain growth behavior of Ni-W alloys in the extremely fine-grained regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanocrystalline pure FCC metals and some alloys are known to exhibit abnormal grain growth. Addition of solutes, such as W, has led to improved grain size stability in nanocrystalline Ni. While several groups have investigated grain growth behavior in Ni-based binary alloys, grain sizes greater than 15 nm were primarily investigated. In the present study, grain growth behavior is examined in grain size regime below 10 nm in nanocrystalline Ni-W alloys with 8 to 15 at% W at 773K. In this size regime, normal grain growth behavior was observed in these alloys, evidenced from (a) parabolic kinetics in plots of square of average grain size against annealing time, and (b) statistical self-similarity on the scaled size distribution in a log-normal plot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time dynamics of local magnetic moments exchange coupled to a metallic system of conduction electrons is subject to dissipative friction even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Phenomenologically, this is usually described by a local Gilbert damping constant. Here, we use both linear response theory and adiabatic response theory to derive the spin friction microscopically for a generic single-band tight-binding model of the electronic structure. The resulting Gilbert damping is time-dependent and nonlocal. For a one-dimensional model, we compare the emergent relaxation dynamics as obtained from LRT and ART against each other and against the full solution of the microscopic equations of motion and demonstrate the importance of nonlocality, while the time dependence turns out to be irrelevant. In two dimensions and for a few magnetic moments in different geometries, it is found that the inclusion of nonlocal Gilbert damping can counterintuitively lead to longer relaxation times. Besides the distance dependence, the directional dependence of the nonlocal Gilbert damping turns out as very important. Our results are based on an expression relating the nonlocal Gilbert damping to the nonlocal tight-binding density of states close to the Fermi energy. This is exact in case of noninteracting electrons. Effects due to electronic correlations are studied within the random-phase approximation. For the Hubbard model at half filling and with increasing interaction strength, we find a strong enhancement of the nonlocality of spin friction.</description>

Abstract: Bismuth has been shown to be topological in its different allotropes and compounds, with one of the most notable examples being the Bi-Sb alloy, the first 3D topological insulator ever discovered. In this paper we explore two-dimensional alloys of Bi and Sb, both crystalline and amorphous, to determine the critical concentrations that render the alloys topological. For the amorphous alloy, we determine the effect of structural disorder on its topological properties, remarkably observing a trivial to topological transition as disorder increases. The alloys are modelled using a Slater-Koster tight-binding model and the topological behaviour is assessed through the entanglement spectrum together with artificial neural networks. Additionally, we perform electronic transport calculations with results compatible with those of the entanglement spectrum, which, furthermore, reveal an insulator to metal transition in the highly disordered regime.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Electrochemical Memory at 600C Enabled by Composition Phase Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CMOS-based microelectronics are limited to ~150{\deg}C and therefore not suitable for the extreme high temperatures in aerospace, energy, and space applications. While wide bandgap semiconductors can provide high-temperature logic, nonvolatile memory devices at high temperatures have been challenging. In this work, we develop a nonvolatile electrochemical memory cell that stores and retains analog and digital information at temperatures as high as 600 {\deg}C. Through correlative electron microscopy, we show that this high-temperature information retention is a result of composition phase separation between the oxidized and reduced forms of amorphous tantalum oxide. This result demonstrates a memory concept that is resilient at extreme temperatures and reveals phase separation as the principal mechanism that enables nonvolatile information storage in these electrochemical memory cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several reports about infinite-layer nickelate thin films suggest that the superconducting critical temperature versus chemical doping phase diagram has a dome-like shape, similar to cuprates. Here, we demonstrate a highly reproducible superconducting state in undoped PrNiO$_2$ thin films grown onto SrTiO$_3$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements demonstrate coherent and defect-free infinite-layer phase, a high structural quality with no unintentional chemical doping and a total absence of interstitial oxygen. X-ray absorption measurements show very sharp features at the Ni L$_{3,2}$-edges with a large linear dichroism, indicating the preferential hole-occupation of Ni$^{1+}$-3d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in a square planar geometry. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering measurements reveal sharp magnon excitations of 200\,meV energy at magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, highly resonant at the Ni$^{1+}$ absorption peak. The results indicate that, when properly stabilized, infinite-layer nickelate thin films are superconducting without chemical doping.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Fingerprint of Mottness in Layer-Dimerized Nb$_3$Br$_8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a well-ordered crystalline solid, insulating behaviour can arise from two mechanisms: electrons can either scatter off a periodic potential, thus forming band gaps that can lead to a band insulator, or they localize due to strong interactions, resulting in a Mott insulator. For an even number of electrons per unit cell, either band- or Mott-insulators can theoretically occur. However, unambiguously identifying an unconventional Mott-insulator with an even number of electrons experimentally has remained a longstanding challenge due to the lack of a momentum-resolved fingerprint. This challenge has recently become pressing for the layer dimerized van der Waals compound Nb$_3$Br$_8$, which exhibits a puzzling magnetic field-free diode effect when used as a weak link in Josephson junctions, but has previously been considered to be a band-insulator. In this work, we present a unique momentum-resolved signature of a Mott-insulating phase in the spectral function of Nb$_3$Br$_8$: the top of the highest occupied band along the out-of-plane dimerization direction $k_z$ has a momentum space separation of $\Delta k_z=2\pi/d$, whereas the valence band maximum of a band insulator would be separated by less than $\Delta k_z=\pi/d$, where $d$ is the average spacing between the layers. As the strong electron correlations inherent in Mott insulators can lead to unconventional superconductivity, identifying Nb$_3$Br$_8$ as an unconventional Mott-insulator is crucial for understanding its apparent time-reversal symmetry breaking Josephson diode effect. Moreover, the momentum-resolved signature employed here could be used to detect quantum phase transition between band- and Mott-insulating phases in van der Waals heterostructures, where interlayer interactions and correlations can be easily tuned to drive such transition.</description>

      <title>Absence of high pressure ground state re-entrant ferroelectricity in PbTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ferroelectricity in the classic perovskite ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ to high pressures with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental diamond-anvil techniques. We use second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy to detect lack of inversion symmetry. Consistent with early understanding and experiments, we find that ferroelectricity disappears at moderate pressures. However, DFT computations show that the disappearance arises from the overtaking of zone boundary instabilities, and not from the squeezing out of the off-centering ferroelectric displacements with pressure, as previously thought. Moreover, at high pressures the distorted perovskite phases are metastable with respect to a new dense centrosymmetric post-perovskite phase with P$2_1/m$ symmetry and 8-coordinated Ti, which becomes stable at about 70 GPa.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation induced by gate voltage oscillation in few layer MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear charge transport, such as nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance and nonlinear Hall effect, has attracted considerable interest in probing the symmetries and topological properties of new materials. Recent research has revealed significant nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance and nonlinear Hall effect in MnBi2Te4, an intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, induced by the quantum metric dipole. However, the inconsistent response with charge density and conflicting C3z symmetry requirement necessitate a thorough understanding of factors affecting the nonlinear transport measurement. This study uncovers an experimental factor leading to significant nonlinear transport signals in MnBi2Te4, attributed to gate voltage oscillation from the application of large alternating current. Additionally, a methodology is proposed to suppress this effect by individually grounding the voltage electrodes during second-harmonic measurements. The investigation underscores the critical importance of assessing the impact of gate voltage oscillation before determining the intrinsic nature of nonlinear transport in 2D material devices with an electrically connected operative gate electrode.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Pockels Coefficient of Ferroelectric Nitride ScAlN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitride ferroelectrics have recently emerged as promising alternatives to oxide ferroelectrics due to their compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. ScAlN, in particular, has exhibited remarkable piezoelectric coupling strength ($K^2$) comparable to that of lithium niobate (LN), making it a valuable choice for RF filters in wireless communications. Recently, ScAlN has sparked interest in its use for nanophotonic devices, chiefly due to its large bandgap facilitating operation in blue wavelengths coupled with promises of enhanced nonlinear optical properties such as a large second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). It is still an open question whether ScAlN can outperform oxide ferroelectrics concerning the Pockels effect -- an electro-optic coupling extensively utilized in optical communications devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of ScAlN's Pockels effect. Our findings reveal that the electro-optic coupling of ScAlN, despite being weak at low Sc concentration, may be significantly enhanced and exceed LiNbO$_3$ at high levels of Sc doping, which points the direction of continued research efforts to unlock the full potential of ScAlN.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional mapping and electronic origin of large altermagnetic splitting near Fermi level in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new kind of collinear magnetism, dubbed altermagnetism, has attracted considerable interests. A key characteristic of altermagnet is the momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization. However, finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level, which necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping and is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, remains challenging. Here by employing synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. The ARPES results are well captured by density functional theory calculations. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. In addition, tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions, which breaks both the space-time reversal symmetry and the translational spin-rotation symmetry. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

Abstract: A recently developed viewpoint on the fundamentals of density-functional theory for finite interacting spin-lattice systems that centers around the notion of degeneracy regions is presented. It allows for an entirely geometrical description of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and v-representability. The phenomena receive exemplification by an Anderson impurity model and other small-lattice examples. The case of adiabatic change and the time-dependent setting are examined as well.</description>

      <title>Acceptor and donor impurity levels in hexagonal-diamond silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the characterization of hexagonal-diamond silicon (2H-Si) have shown that this material possesses remarkably different structural, electronic, and optical properties as compared to the common cubic-diamond (3C) polytype. Interestingly, despite the wide range of physical properties analyzed, to date no study has investigated impurity energy levels in 2H-Si. Here, we present results of ab initio DFT simulations to describe the effect of p- and n-type substitutional doping on the structural and electronic properties of hexagonal-diamond Si (2H-Si). We first provide a detailed analysis of how a given impurity can assume a different local symmetry depending on the host crystal phase. Then, by studying neutral and charged dopants, we carefully estimate donors and acceptors transition energy levels in 2H-Si and compare them with the cubic-diamond (3C) case. In the case of acceptors, the formation energy is always lower in 2H-Si and is associated with a shallower charge transition level with respect to 3C-Si. On the other hand, donors prefer the cubic phase and have transition energies smaller with respect to 2H-Si. Finally, by employing a simple model based on the 2H/3C band offset diagram, we prove the physical validity of our findings and we show how holes can be used to stabilize the 2H-Si phase. Overall, the described doping properties represent a robust starting point for further theoretical and experimental investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

Abstract: With advancements in computational molecular modeling and powerful structure search methods, it is now possible to systematically screen crystal structures for small organic molecules. In this context, we introduce the Python package High-throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction (HTOCSP), which enables the prediction and screening of crystal packing for small organic molecules in an automated, high-throughput manner. Specifically, we describe the workflow, which encompasses molecular analysis, force field generation, and crystal generation and sampling, all within customized constraints based on user input. We demonstrate the application of \texttt{HTOCSP} by systematically screening organic crystals for 100 molecules using different sampling strategies and force field options. Furthermore, we analyze the benchmark results to understand the underlying factors that influence the complexity of the crystal energy landscape. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of the package and potential future extensions.</description>

      <title>Structural and electronic transformations in TiO2 induced by electric current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-situ diffuse neutron scattering experiments revealed that when electric current is passed through single crystals of rutile TiO2 under conditions conducive to flash sintering, it induces the formation of parallel planes of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, a current perpendicular to the c-axis generates planes normal to the (132) reciprocal lattice vector, whereas currents aligned with the c-axis form planes normal to the (132) and to the (225) vector. The concentration of defects increases with incresing current. The structural modifications are linked to the appearance of signatures of interacting Ti3+ moments in magnetic susceptibility, signifying a structural collapse around the vacancy planes. Electrical conductivity measurements of the modified material reveal several electronic transitions between semiconducting states (via a metal-like intermediate state) with the smallest gap being 27 meV. Pristine TiO2 can be restored by heating followed by slow cooling in air. Our work suggests a novel paradigm for achieving switching of electrical conductivity related to the flash phenomenon</description>

      <title>Atomically Flat Dielectric Patterns for Band Gap Engineering and Lateral Junction Formation in MoSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining a precise sputter etching method with subsequent AlO$_x$ growth within an atomic layer deposition chamber enables fabrication of atomically flat lateral patterns of SiO$_2$ and AlO$_x$. The transfer of MoSe$_2$ monolayers onto these dielectrically modulated substrates results in formation of lateral heterojunctions, with the flat substrate topography leading to minimal strain across the junction. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements show significant variations in the contact potential difference (CPD) across the interface, with AlO$_x$ regions inducing a 230~mV increase in CPD. Spatially resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals shifts in spectral weight of neutral and charged exciton species across the different dielectric regions. On the AlO$_x$ side, the Fermi energy moves closer to the conduction band, leading to a higher trion-to-exciton ratio, indicating a bandgap shift consistent with CPD changes. In addition, transient reflection spectroscopy highlights the influence of the dielectric environment on carrier dynamics, with the SiO$_2$ side exhibiting rapid carrier decay typical of neutral exciton recombination. In contrast, the AlO$_x$ side shows slower, mixed decay behavior consistent with conversion of trions back into excitons. These results demonstrate how dielectric substrate engineering can tune the electronic and optical characteristics of proximal two-dimensional materials, allowing scalable fabrication of advanced junctions for novel (opto)electronics applications.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel materials with large electro-optic (EO) coefficients are essential for developing ultra-compact broadband modulators and enabling effective quantum transduction. Compared to lithium niobate, the most widely used nonlinear optical material, wurtzite AlScN offers advantages in nano-photonic devices due to its compatibility with integrated circuits. We perform detailed first-principles calculations to investigate the electro-optic effect in $\mathrm{Al}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sc}_{x}\mathrm{N}$ alloys and superlattices. At elevated Sc concentrations in alloys, the EO coefficients increase; importantly, we find that cation ordering along the $c$ axis leads to enhanced EO response. Strain engineering can be used to further manipulate the EO coefficients of AlScN films. With applied in-plane strains, the piezoelectric contributions to the EO coefficients increase dramatically, even exceeding 251 pm/V. We also explore the possibility of EO enhancement through superlattice engineering, finding that nonpolar $a$-plane $\mathrm{(AlN)}_m/\mathrm{(ScN)}_n$ superlattices increase EO coefficients beyond 40 pm/V. Our findings provide design principles to enhance the electro-optic effect through alloy engineering and heterostructure architecture.</description>

      <title>Electronic Transport and Fermi Surface Topology of Zintl Phase Compound SrZn2Ge2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study on the electronic transport properties of SrZn2Ge2 single crystals. The electrical resistivity of the compound exhibits metallic behavior, following a T^2 dependence below 35 K, consistent with the Fermi liquid behavior. However, a notable deviation is observed from this behavior at lower temperatures as a pronounced resistivity plateau emerges below 10 K. This plateau is remarkably robust, and persists under the magnetic fields of up to 10 T. Both the transverse and longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibit a crossover at critical field B* from weak-field quadratic-like to high-field unsaturated linear field dependence at low temperatures (T \leq 50 K). Possible sources of linear magnetoresistance are discussed based on the Fermi surface topology, classical and quantum transport models. The Hall resistivity data establish SrZn2Ge2 as a multiband system with contributions from both the electrons and holes. The Hall coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing temperature and magnetic field, changing its sign from positive to negative. The negative Hall coefficient observed at low temperatures in high fields and at high temperatures over the entire field range suggests that the highly mobile electron charge carriers dominate the electronic transport. Our first-principles calculations show that nontrivial topological surface states exist in SrZn2Ge2 within the bulk gap along the Gamma-M path. Notably, these surface states extend from the valence to conduction band with their number varying based on the Sr and Ge termination plane. The Fermi surface of the compound exhibits a distinct tetragonal petal-like structure, with one open and several closed surfaces. Overall, these findings offer crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying the electronic transport of the compound.</description>

Abstract: True random numbers are essential in various research and engineering problems. Their generation depends upon a robust physical entropy noise. Here, we present true random number generation by harnessing the conductance noise probed in structurally metastable 1T' molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). The noise, well-fitting a Poisson process, is proved a robust physical entropy noise at low and even cryogenic temperatures. Noise characteristic analysis suggests the noise may originate from the polarization variations of the underlying ferroelectric dipoles in 1T' MoTe2. We demonstrate the noise allows for true random number generation, enabling their use as seed for generating high-throughput secure random numbers exceeding 1 Mbit/s, appealing for practical applications in, for instance, cryptography where data security is now a severe issue. As an example, we show biometric information safeguarding in neural networks by using the random numbers as mask, proving a promising data security measure in big data and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modelling of Magnetism in Strongly Correlated Materials: Evaluating Constrained DFT and the Hubbard Model for Y114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds represent a fascinating playground for exploring the intricate relationship between structural distortions, electronic properties, and magnetic behaviour, holding significant promise for technological advancements. Among these compounds, YBaCo$_4$O$_{7}$ (Y114) is attractive due to its manifestation of a ferrimagnetic component at low temperature intertwined with distortion effect due to the charge disproportionation on Co ions, exerting profound impact on its magnetic properties. In this perspective paper, we study the structural and magnetic intricacies of the Y114 crystal using a novel first-principles methodology. Traditionally, the investigation of such materials has relied heavily on computational modelling using density-functional theory (DFT) with the on-site Coulomb interaction correction $U$ (DFT+$U$) based on the Hubbard model (sometimes including Hund's exchange coupling parameter $J$, DFT+$U$+$J$) to unravel their complexities. Herein, we analysed the spurious effects of magnetic-moment delocalisation and spillover to non-magnetic ions in the lattice on electronic structure and magnetic properties of Y114. To overcome this problem we have applied constrained DFT (cDFT) based on the potential self-consistency approach, and comprehensively explore the Y114 crystal's characteristics in its ferrimagnetic order. We find that cDFT yields magnetic moments of Co ions much closer to the experimental values than Hubbard model with the parameters $U$ and $J$ fitted to reproduce experimental lattice constants. cDFT allows for an accurate prediction of magnetic properties using oxidation states of magnetic ions as well-defined parameters. Through this perspective, we not only enhance our understanding of the magnetic interactions in Y114 crystal, but also pave the way for future investigations into magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the microscopic theory of the spin Nernst effect, which is a transverse spin current directly induced by a temperature gradient, employing the linear response theory with Luttinger's gravitational potential method. We consider a generic, non-interacting electron system with randomly distributed impurities and evaluate the spin current response to the gravitational potential. Our theory takes into account a contribution of the local equilibrium current modified by Luttinger's gravitational potential and is thus consistent with the thermodynamic principle that thermal responses should vanish. The Ward-Takahashi identities ensure that the spin Nernst current is well-behaved at low temperatures in any order of the random impurity potentials. Furthermore, we microscopically derive the spin-current version of Mott's formula, which associates the spin Nernst coefficient with the spin Hall conductivity. The spin-current version of the St\v{r}eda formula is also discussed. To demonstrate these findings, the spin Nernst current of three-dimensional Dirac electrons is computed. Our theory is general and can therefore be extended to interacting electron systems, where Mott's formula no longer holds.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

      <title>Effects of Self-Hybridized Exciton-Polaritons on WS2 Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitonic semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are attractive for next-generation photovoltaics (PVs) with low cost, light weight, and low material consumption. In WS2 and other TMDCs, the simultaneous large optical constants and strong exciton resonance can result in the primary photogenerated species being self-hybridized exciton-polaritons emerging from the strong coupling of excitons and optical cavity modes formed by the WS2. We show that strong coupling can benefit photovoltaic performance, with external quantum efficiencies and power conversion efficiencies enhanced by an order of magnitude, approaching values of 55 and 2%, respectively. Thickness dependent device characterization is performed to study the polariton dispersion, revealing anomalous internal quantum efficiency and fill factor behavior that are attributed to polariton-modified exciton transport processes. Our results uncover a significant mechanism in the photoconversion process for PVs from high index, excitonic semiconductors and indicate the utility of strong coupling for optoelectronic devices.</description>
