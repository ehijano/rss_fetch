      <title>Excitonic Theory of the Ultrafast Optical Response of 2D-Quantum-Confined Semiconductors at Elevated Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach to the magneto-fluorescence of triplet excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluorescence of triplet excitons and color-centers is strongly dependent on magnetic field that mixes the zero field spin eigenstates that determine the radiative recombination rates back into the singlet ground state through spin-orbit coupling. For films of molecules, and polycristaline color-centers samples an average over molecular orientations has to be performed to model the magneto-fluorescence lineshapes. This limits our analytical understanding of the lineshapes and complicates the analysis of the fluorescence dependence on magnetic field. Here, we present a framework that allows to average over triplet molecular orientations analytically. Our approach achieves provides very accurate numerical routines computing precisely the averages matrix elements that appear in magneto-fluorescence and semi-analytical approximations that can be used to model experimental traces.</description>

      <title>A Space-Charge-Limited van der Waals Spin Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating semiconducting and magnetic materials could combine transistor-like operation with nonvolatility and enable architectures such as logic-in-memory. Here, we employ correlated electrical transport and scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to elucidate a spin transistor concept that amalgamates both vertical and lateral transport in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor, distinct from purely vertical tunneling devices. Our device, based on a monolayer-bilayer junction in CrSBr, displays giant, gate-tunable magnetoresistance driven by the dual action of electrostatic doping on space-charge-limited lateral conduction and interlayer exchange coupling. Moreover, we visualize a field-trainable, layer-sharing effect that selects between coherent or domain-wall reversal at the spin-flip transition, enabling multilevel, memristive conductance states. These findings open opportunities for 2D magnetic semiconductors to address limitations in contemporary computing.</description>

      <title>Current switching behaviour mediated via hinge modes in higher order topological phase using altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework to engineer hybrid-order and higher-order topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulators by coupling to $d$-wave altermagnets (AMs). Presence of only $d_{x^2-y^2}$-type AM drives the system into a hybrid-order topological phase where both first-order and second-order topological phases coexist. This phase is characterized by spectral analysis, low-energy surface theory, dipolar and quadrupolar winding numbers, and it's signature is further confirmed by two-terminal differential conductance calculations. Incorporation of the $d_{x^2-z^2}$-type AM drives the system into two second-order topological insulator phases hosting distinct type of hinge modes. They are also topologically characterized by spectral analysis, topological invariants, low-energy surface thoery, and transport calculations. Importantly, the localization and direction of propagation of these one-dimensional hinge modes are controllable by tuning the relative strengths of the alermagnetic exchange orders. We utilize this feature to propose a tunable current-switching behaviour mediated via the hinge modes. Our results establish AMs based hybrid structure as a versatile platform for controllable higher-order topology and hinge-mediated device applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of coherent spin-shuttling in a QuBus with charged defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in coherent conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttling are paving the way for large-scale quantum computing platforms with qubit connectivity achieved by spin qubit shuttles. We developed a simulation tool to investigate numerically the impact of device imperfections on the spin-coherence of conveyor-mode shuttling in Si/SiGe. We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit.</description>

      <title>From fractional Chern insulators to topological electronic crystals in moir\'e MoTe2: quantum geometry tuning via remote layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions,encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, is believed to be a decisive ingredient in stabilizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect(i.e., fractional Chern insulator, FCI, at zero magnetic field), against competing symmetry-breaking phases.A direct experimental demonstration of quantum geometry-driven switching between distinct correlated topological phases, however, has been lacking. Here, we report experimental evidence of such a switch in a high-quality 3.7 twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) device consisting of both A-A bilayer and A-AB trilayer regions. While composite Fermi liquid CFL/FQAH phases are established in A-A tMoTe2,the A-AB region-effectively an A-A moire bilayer proximitized by a remote B layer-develops a series of topological electronic crystal (TEC, also referred to as generalized QAH crystal, QAHC) states with integer quantized Hall conductance at commensurate fractional fillings v=1/2, 2/3, and an incommensurate filling factor v=0.53.The electrostatic phase diagram is mapped out by combined transport and optical measurements, showing that these TEC states emerge within the first moir'e valence band prior to any charge transfer to the B layer. Exact diagonalization (ED) incorporating the remote-layer-induced intralayer potential demonstrates a transition from a CFL-like manifold in the A-A limit to a Chern number C=1 ground-state consistent with a TEC at v=1/2 , accompanied by the further breakdown of ideal band geometry. Our results provide experimental evidence of quantum geometry-tuned competition between FQAH/CFL and TEC phases in a moir\'e Chern band and pave the way for further exploring correlation-driven topological phenomena by tuning quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic Functional Properties in Collinear Antiferromagnets Based on Multipole Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Spin-flop driven interfacial tunneling magnetoresistance in an antiferromagnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of two-dimensional (2D) materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has shown excellent performance and rich physics. As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric planar magnetotransport: a probe for magnetic geometry in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport phenomena provide a direct probe of band quantum geometry in noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials, such as the nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole. In altermagnets, a recently discovered class of even-parity collinear magnets with $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, conventional second-order responses are prohibited by an emergent $C_{2z}$ symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders. We show that the field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including the planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses. Our work establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, providing a general framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced modulation of conductance in graphene with magnetic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.</description>

      <title>High-order two-component fractional quantum Hall states around filling factor $\nu = 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-component fractional quantum Hall (2C-FQH) states in electron bilayers have been known for decades, yet their experimental realization remained limited to low-order fractions. Here we report on several families of high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge when an in-plane magnetic field drives a controlled monolayer-to-bilayer transition in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well. These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $\nu = 1$, from both $\nu = 2/3$ and $\nu = 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences. Our findings substantially expand the known landscape of 2C-FQH states, highlighting the unexpected richness of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and opening new routes for probing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Configurable antiferromagnetic domains and lateral exchange bias in atomically thin CrPS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial exchange coupling between antiferromagnets (AFMs) and ferromagnets (FMs) crucially makes it possible to shift the FM hysteresis, known as exchange bias, and to switch AFM states. Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM-FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS$_4$, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM-FM technologies.</description>

      <title>Transport evidence of surface states in magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators can host chiral 1D edge channels at zero magnetic field, when a magnetic gap opens at the Dirac point in the band structure of 2D topological surface states, lead- ing to the quantum anomalous Hall effect in ultra-thin nanostructures. For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.</description>

      <title>Strain Response as a Probe of Spinons in Quantum Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Digital-Alloy-Based Bragg Mirrors in High-Q Microcavities for Polariton Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the molecular-beam epitaxy of high-Q planar GaAs-based microcavities in which the AlGaAs high-index layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are replaced by short-period GaAs/AlAs superlattices (digital alloys) with similar optical properties. This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters.
  Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 200 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Cavity-Molecular Dynamics of Vibrational Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) approach with a light-matter Hamiltonian beyond the long-wavelength approximation to propagate the dynamics of vibrational polaritons formed by coupling molecular vibrations to confined radiation inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity. Here, we develop a parallelized propagation scheme with lightweight inter-CPU communication by exploiting the sparse nature of the light-matter interactions in the real space representation. We find that the computationally expensive Born charges required for our propagation can be replaced with the computationally inexpensive Mulliken charges to obtain qualitatively accurate linear spectra especially when the nonlinearity (arising from molecular vibrations) of the light-matter interaction term is not substantial. However, the same approach may not be suitable to be used for studying cavity modification of energy transport or chemical dynamics as this approximation leads to spurious heating of the light-matter hybrid system. We demonstrate the utility of this on-the-fly approach to compute angle resolved polaritonic spectra of water. We implement our approach as an open-source computational package, CavOTF, which is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Magneto-Optical Effects in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ideal altermagnets are a class of collinear, crystal-symmetry-enforced fully compensated magnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands, in which contributions from Berry curvature to magneto-optical effects (MOEs) are strictly forbidden by an effective time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that, in such systems, MOEs are exclusively induced by the quantum metric and, in realistic altermagnets, are typically dominated by it. We refer to Berry-curvature-induced MOEs as conventional MOEs and to quantum-metric-dominated MOEs as unconventional MOEs. We derive general formulas that incorporate both Berry curvature and quantum metric for unconventional MOEs in altermagnets, enabling a quantitative evaluation of their respective contributions. Through symmetry analysis, we prove that ideal altermagnets are constrained to exhibit only unconventional MOEs. Using the three-dimensional canonical altermagnet MnTe and the emerging two-dimensional bilayer twisted altermagnet CrSBr as illustrative examples, we demonstrate that unconventional MOEs are prevalent in altermagnets. Our results establish altermagnets as a natural platform for quantum-metric-driven optical phenomena, substantially broadening the scope of MOEs and providing concrete predictions that can be tested in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is emerging as a promising route toward the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. Here, we develop an analytical model for the proximity effect induced by an ordinary s-wave superconductor (SC) placed on top of a MTI thin film with finite thickness. Using a perturbative approach with respect to the electron tunneling between MTI and SC, we derive the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function and evaluate the position-dependent induced pairing as a function of all the system parameters. This framework allows us to resolve the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of the induced superconducting order parameter. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the decay length of the pairing amplitude at the $k_x=k_y=0$ point, and show that increasing magnetization enhances the spin-polarized triplet components and the p-wave contributions of the anomalous Green's function. These findings highlight the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in MTI films, providing analytical insight into the emergence of unconventional pairing symmetries relevant for the realization of Majorana modes in finite geometries.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Device Imperfections on Electron Shuttling in SiMOS devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive theoretical and experimental work has established high-fidelity electron shuttling in Si/SiGe systems, whereas demonstrations in Si/SiO2 (SiMOS) remain at an early stage. To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures.</description>

      <title>Non-radiative energy transfer between boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride and other 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron vacancies ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for two-dimensional quantum sensors capable of operating at atomic-scale proximity. However, the mechanisms responsible for photoluminescence quenching in thin hBN sensing layers when placed in contact with absorptive materials remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.</description>

      <title>Observation of a supersolid phase in a spin-orbit coupled exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), spin-orbit coupling (SOC) produces supersolidity. It is a peculiar state of matter, which, in addition to the superfluid behaviour shows periodic density modulation typical for crystals. Here, we report the fabrication of a new type of optical microcavity allowing to achieve room-temperature supersolidity for a quantum fluid of light. The microcavity is filled with a nematic liquid crystal (LC) and two layers of the organic polymer MeLPPP hosting exciton resonances. We demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in the two distinct degenerate minima of the dispersion created by the LC induced Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) SOC. The condensate real-space distribution shows density stripes located randomly from one condensate realization to another despite the presence of a random disorder potential. This demonstrates the immunity of stripes against disorder (that is, superfluidity) and the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. We also report the random appearance of vortices via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, another smoking gun of superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Fermion parity switches imprinted in the photonic field of cavity embedded Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a finite-length Kitaev chain coupled to a single mode photonic cavity. The topological phase of the finite-length Kitaev chain is characterized by the presence of fermion parity switching points that correspond to the degeneracy between even and odd parity ground states. Using exact diagonalization, we compute the many-body energy spectrum of the electron-photon Hamiltonian and we find that the ground state in the topological phase of the Kitaev chain is only weakly affected by the cavity coupling. This is in contrast with the excited states showing strong dependence on the cavity frequency. We find that the photon number and the photonic field quadratures peak at values of the chemical potential corresponding to parity switching points revealing a property of the finite-length Kitaev chain in the topological phase. This later finding suggests that quantum optics experiments could be used to detect topological features of the Kitaev chain embedded into a photonic cavity. Moreover, calculations of photonic quadratures reveal squeezed states that are both captured by the exact diagonalization technique and mean field decoupling. However, the mean field approach fails to correctly capture the photonic probability in the odd photonic states.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultraclean, undoped carbon nanotubes are observed to be always insulating, even when the gap predicted by band theory is zero: the residual band gap is then thought to have a many-body origin. Here we theoretically show that the correlated insulator is excitonic in $all stable$ narrow-gap tubes irrespective of their size, thus extending our previous claim, limited to gapless (armchair) tubes [D.~Varsano, S.~Sorella, D.~Sangalli, M.~Barborini, S.~Corni, E.~Molinari, M.~Rontani, Nature Communications $\mathbf{8}$, 1461 (2017)]. We derive the scaling law of the exciton binding energy with the tube radius and chirality, and compute self-consistently the fundamental transport gap of the excitonic insulator, by enhancing the two-band model with an accurate treatment of screening validated from first principles. Our findings point to the broader connection between the exciton length scale, dictated by structure, and the stability of the excitonic phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization. Direct observation of the characteristic altermagnetic spin splitting, however, remains challenging. Indirect signatures can be obtained via transport studies, which so far have only considered homogeneous driving fields. We propose to leverage nonuniform electric fields and spin density gradients to probe the shape and the spin polarization of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces via transport measurements. By using both a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and a lattice Keldysh formalism, we show that altermagnets excite swirling electric and spin currents whose profiles depend on the relative orientation of altermagnetic lobes with respect to the sample boundaries. These currents can be measured via magnetometry techniques. Unlike previous proposals considering the hydrodynamic regime of transport, swirling currents are observed even in the Ohmic regime and rely exclusively on the altermagnetic spin splitting, with no swirls observed in ferromagnets. The electric and spin current vortices predicted here provide a different altermagnetic signature in an experimentally accessible setup.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear magnetization dynamics as a route to nonreciprocal phases, spin superfluidity, and analogue gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.</description>

Abstract: We study diffusive magnetotransport in highly p-doped large area twisted bilayer graphene samples as a function of twist angle, crossing from 1{\deg} (below), to 20{\deg} (above) the van Hove singularity with 7{\deg} and 9{\deg} samples near the van Hove singularity. We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9{\deg} sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity. Further improvements in sample quality and applications to large area moire materials will open new avenues to observe quantum interference effects.</description>

      <title>Enabling the bulk photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric materials through an external electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Chern Insulator at Zero Electric Field in ABCB-Stacked Tetralayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hybrid confinement techniques for polariton simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton III-V semiconductor microcavities provide a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling topological photonics and quantum simulation for advanced photonic functionalities. Here, we introduce two novel fabrication techniques - etch-and-oversputter and deposit-and-oversputter - that overcome limitations of traditional photonic confinement. Both use structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavities to create deep, highly controllable potentials, while leveraging high-quality GaAs-based materials, which achieve excellent Q-factors. A sputtered all-dielectric top mirror introduces an innovative hybrid approach, simplifying fabrication while maintaining quality compared to deep ion etching. Utilizing a Kagome lattice as a benchmark, we show high-quality optical band structures previously inaccessible with deep etching. Furthermore, we study a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice and demonstrate polariton lasing from a zero-dimensional corner mode, confirming precise control over couplings and tight polariton localization. These methods enable fabrication of intricate lattices, including higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum regimes utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism due to tight photonic confinement.</description>

      <title>Miniature work-to-work converter engine powered by motor protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a miniature microscale engine that can override the role of thermal fluctuations has remained elusive and is an important open challenge. Here we provide the design and theoretical framework for a unique information-based engine - a work-to-work converter - comprising a sub-micron size bead and motor protein-microtubule (MT) complex in an optical trap setup. We demonstrate how by implementing a simple motor protein state-dependent feedback protocol of the optical trap stiffness, this engine is able to harness and convert the movement of a motor protein into work output. Unlike other conventional microengines, the fidelity and performance of this engine is determined by the stochasticity of motor (un)binding characteristics. We obtain an analytical form of the work distribution function, average work output and average power output, providing quantitative predictions for engine performance which are validated by stochastic simulations. Remarkably, the average work output per cycle is at least an order of magnitude higher than the thermal fluctuations and supersedes the performance of other microscale engines realized so far.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Magnetoresistance beyond the Julli\`ere Model for Spin Selectivity in Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Julli\`ere model, observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Research with Local-Web RAG: Toward Automated System-Level Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a long-horizon, hierarchical deep research (DR) agent designed for complex materials and device discovery problems that exceed the scope of existing Machine Learning (ML) surrogates and closed-source commercial agents. Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.</description>

      <title>Optical spin precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Period-averaged electromagnetic spin angular momentum is a well-established quantity for monochromatic fields, governing phenomena such as light-matter interactions with chiral particles and spin-orbit coupling effects. In contrast, the spin angular momentum of non-monochromatic fields remains unexplored. Here, we extend the concept of optical spin to the domain of non-monochromatic electromagnetic fields. Through this formulation, we uncover the precessional dynamics of electromagnetic spin in specific polychromatic configurations, including the superposition of circularly and linearly polarized plane waves propagating orthogonally at different frequencies, as well as fields generated by a precessing magnetic dipole. We discover that the dynamics of the electromagnetic spin in these cases obeys a Landau-Lifshitz-like equation establishing a profound parallel between dynamics of magnetization and photonic spin.</description>
