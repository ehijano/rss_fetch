      <title>Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators: A View from the Corner Charge Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, within a finite region is a powerful approach to characterizing quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that the corner charge fluctuation reveals universal information even for generic $\textit{lattice}$ systems of non-interacting electrons. We first prove that universal angle-dependence can be recovered in the $\textit{small-angle}$ limit for proper partitions of the lattice, from which the integrated Fubini-Study quantum metric can be extracted. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically. Numerical verification is presented for various Chern insulator models, demonstrating the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, we highlight a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Adaptive Nanoscale Domain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive networks can sense and adjust to dynamic environments to optimize their performance. Understanding their nanoscale responses to external stimuli is essential for applications in nanodevices and neuromorphic computing. However, it is challenging to image such responses on the nanoscale with crystallographic sensitivity. Here, the evolution of nanodomain networks in (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n superlattices was directly visualized in real space as the system adapts to ultrafast repetitive optical excitations that emulate controlled neural inputs. The adaptive response allows the system to explore a wealth of metastable states that were previously inaccessible. Their reconfiguration and competition were quantitatively measured by scanning x-ray nanodiffraction as a function of the number of applied pulses, in which crystallographic characteristics were quantitatively assessed by assorted diffraction patterns using unsupervised machine-learning methods. The corresponding domain boundaries and their connectivity were drastically altered by light, holding promise for light-programmable nanocircuits in analogy to neuroplasticity. Phase-field simulations elucidate that the reconfiguration of the domain networks is a result of the interplay between photocarriers and transient lattice temperature. The demonstrated optical control scheme and the uncovered nanoscopic insights open opportunities for remote control of adaptive nanoscale domain networks.</description>

      <title>Validation of contact mechanics models for Atomic Force Microscopy via Finite Elements Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections in the framework of linear elasticity for the analysis of force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters by means of finite elements simulations. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter.We carried out a comprehensive characterization of the corrections for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves, as well as a validation of a linearized form of the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter and of the combined correction for large indentations and bottom effect.Our results show that the corrected Hertz model in combination with the use of a spherical indenter allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples and represent a powerful toolkit to analyse experimental data acquired using micrometre-sized colloidal probes on samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Origin and Microscopic Mechanism of Electrical Magnetochiral Anisotropy in Tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear transport effects in response to external magnetic fields, i.e. electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), have attracted much attention for their importance to study quantum and spin-related phenomena. Indeed, they have permitted the exploration of topological surface states and charge-to-spin conversion processes in low-symmetry systems. Nevertheless, despite the inherent correlation between the symmetry of the material under examination and its non-linear transport characteristics, there is a lack of experimental demonstration to delve into this relationship and to unveil their microscopic mechanisms. Here, we study eMChA in chiral elemental Tellurium (Te) along different crystallographic directions, establishing the connection between the different eMChA components and the crystal symmetry of Te. We observed different longitudinal eMChA components with collinear current and magnetic field, demonstrating experimentally the radial angular momentum texture of Te. We also measured a transverse non-linear resistance which, as the longitudinal counterpart, scales bilinearly with current and magnetic fields, illustrating that they are different manifestations of the same effect. Finally, we study the scaling law of the eMChA, evidencing that extrinsic scattering from dynamic sources is the dominant microscopic mechanism. These findings underscore the efficacy of symmetry-based investigations in understanding and predicting non-linear transport phenomena, with potential applications in spintronics and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Free-electron coupling to surface polaritons mediated by small scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of surface polaritons (SPs) to enhance and manipulate light fields down to deep-subwavelength length scales enables applications in optical sensing and nonlinear optics at the nanoscale. However, the wavelength mismatch between light and SPs prevents direct optical excitation of surface-bound modes, thereby limiting the widespread development of SP-based photonics. Free electrons are a natural choice to directly excite strongly confined SPs because they can supply field components of high momentum at designated positions with subnanometer precision. Here, we theoretically explore free-electron--SP coupling mediated by small scatterers and show that low-energy electrons can efficiently excite surface modes with a maximum probability reached at an optimum surface--scatterer distance. By aligning the electron beam with a periodic array of scatterers placed near a polariton-supporting interface, in-plane Smith--Purcell emission results in the excitation of surface modes along well-defined directions. Our results support using scattering elements to excite SPs with low-energy electrons.</description>

      <title>Emergent pair symmetries in systems with poor man's Majorana modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-site Kitaev chains are promising for realizing Majorana zero modes without topological protection but fully nonlocal, which are known as poor man's Majorana modes. While several signatures have already been reported both theoretically and experimentally, it still remains unknown what is the nature of superconducting correlations in the presence of poor man's Majorana modes. In this work, we study few-site Kitaev chains and demonstrate that they host pair correlations with distinct symmetries, entirely determined by the underlying quantum numbers. In particular, we find that a two-site Kitaev chain hosts local (odd-frequency) and nonlocal (odd- and even-frequency) pair correlations, both spin polarized and highly tunable by the system parameters. Interestingly, the odd-frequency pair correlations exhibit a divergent behaviour around zero frequency when the nonlocal $p$-wave pair potential and electron tunneling are of the same order, an effect that can be controlled by the onsite energies. Since a divergent odd-frequency pairing is directly connected to the intrinsic spatial nonlocality of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors, the divergent odd-frequency pairing here reflects the intrinsic Majorana nonlocality of poor man's Majorana modes but without any relation to topology. Our findings could help understanding the emergent pair correlations in few-site Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Spin torque driven electron paramagnetic resonance of a single spin in a pentacene molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over quantum systems is typically achieved by time-dependent electric or magnetic fields. Alternatively, electronic spins can be controlled by spin-polarized currents. Here we demonstrate coherent driving of a single spin by a radiofrequency spin-polarized current injected from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope into an organic molecule. With the excitation of electron paramagnetic resonance, we established dynamic control of single spins by spin torque using a local electric current. In addition our work highlights the dissipative action of the spin-transfer torque, in contrast to the nondissipative action of the magnetic field, which allows for the manipulation of individual spins based on controlled decoherence.</description>

      <title>Perspective on Majorana bound-states in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computing and Majorana bound states were initially theorized between 2000 and 2010. These concepts gradually transitioned to practical implementations during the subsequent decade (2010-2020). Various directions have been investigated with mixed success. With respect to hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, great progress has been achieved in the larger area of mesoscopic superconductivity. Firm evidence for a topological phase in hybrid 1D nanowires, however, has not been demonstrated. Now, in the third decade, the lack of definitive topological results prompts a reevaluation. As an active participant, I have witnessed phases of hope, exuberance, and a return to realism and taking a step back. This Perspective provides a personal account of the past decade, my view on the current situation and challenges ahead. I assume the reader is familiar with the subject at the level of, e.g. the review by Prada et al. [1] from which I repeat as little as possible and refer to the extensive reference list for a comprehensive overview. The purpose of this Perspective is to share personal experiences and motivations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy corner modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Force Microscopy: High Quality Factor Two-Pass Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) is a well-established technique in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) that allows the imaging of magnetic samples with spatial resolution of tens of nm and stray fields down to the mT range. Spatial resolution and field sensitivity can be improved significantly by measuring in vacuum conditions. This effect originates from the higher quality factor (Q-factor) of the cantilevers oscillation in vacuum compared to ambient conditions. However, while high Q-factors are desirable as they directly improve the magnetic measurement signal, they pose a challenge when pursuing a standard MFM two-pass (lift) mode measurement. At high Q-factors amplitude-based topography measurements become impossible and MFM phase response behaves non-linear. Here we present an implementation of a modified two-pass mode into a vacuum atomic force microscope (AFM) that overcomes these issues. By controlling Q in the first pass and using a phase-locked loop (PLL) technique in the second pass, high Q-factor measurements in vacuum are enabled. By measuring the cantilevers frequency shift instead of phase shift, otherwise emerging non-linearities are eliminated. The achievable improvements in resolution and sensitivity are demonstrated on patterned magnetic nanostructured samples. Elimination of non-linear response is showcased by a measurement of a very well-known calculable multilayer reference sample that is used for tip calibration in quantitative MFM (qMFM).</description>

      <title>trARPES and optical transport properties of irradiated twisted bilayer graphene in steady-state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the trARPES spectrum and optical Hall conductivity in periodically driven twisted bilayer graphene, considering both steady-state and "projected" occupations of the Floquet state. In periodically driven pre-thermalized systems, steady-state occupation of Floquet states is predicted to occur when coupled to a bath, while these states have projected occupation instantaneously after the driving starts. We study how these two regimes can give markedly different responses in optical transport properties. In particular, our results show that steady-state occupation leads to near-quantized optical Hall conductivity for a range of driving parameters in twisted bilayer graphene, whereas projected occupation leads to non-quantized values. We discuss the experimental feasibility of probing such non-equilibrium states in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Generalized anomalous Hall crystals in twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a dilute two-dimensional electron gas, Coulomb interactions can stabilize the formation of a Wigner crystal. Although Wigner crystals are topologically trivial, it has been predicted that electrons in a partially-filled band can break continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry spontaneously to form an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). Here, we report the observation of a generalized AHC in twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene whose formation is seeded by the moire potential. The crystal quadruples the moire unit-cell area, coinciding with an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect. The Chern number of the state is exceptionally tunable, and can be switched reversibly between +1 and -1 by electric and magnetic fields. Recent theories have predicted the generalized AHC to act as a parent state of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, pointing to twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene as a promising platform in the search for new correlated and topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Evidence of thermodynamics and magnetic monopole plasma formation by photon-magnon interaction in artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices (ASI), containing magnetic monopole quasi-particles emerging at room temperature, have been investigated as a promising system to be applied in alternative low-power information technology devices. However, restrictions associated with the intrinsic energetic connections between opposing magnetic monopoles in conventional ASI need to be overcome to achieve this purpose. Here, photon-magnon scattering in nanomagnets is examined as an approach to locally activate the collective dynamics of interacting magnetic systems at the nanoscale. Low-power white and polarized light were employed as a new tool to manipulate magnetic monopole intensity, leading to tuning on the particles response to external magnetic field and spontaneous magnetization flipping without external field (thermodynamics). Our findings showing evidence of magnetic monopole plasma formation in a regular square ASI system are explained by an analytical model of photon-magnon conversion acting directly on the ASI nanomagnet dipole. Micromagnetic simulations based on the samples parameters and values obtained from the model present a very good qualitative correspondence between theory and observations for the investigated ASI system.</description>

      <title>Quantum hall transformer in a quantum point contact over the full range of transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment [Cohen et al., Science 382, 542 (2023)] observed a quantized $e^2/2h$ conductance tunneling into a fractional quantum hall edge in the strong coupling limit, which is consistent with the prediction of a quantum Hall transformer. We model this quantum point contact (QPC) as a quantum wire with a spatially-varying Luttinger parameter and a back-scattering impurity and use a numerical solution to find the wavepacket scattering and microwave (i.e. finite frequency) has conductance at the interface. We then compare the microwave conductance to an analytic solution of a Luttinger liquid with an abruptly varying Luttinger parameter and a back-scattering impurity, which is obtained by mapping the problem to a boundary sine-Gordon (BSG) model. Finally, we show that the quantum Hall transformer can survive the inclusion of the domain wall which is expected to occur in a wide QPC, which is experimentally relevant, provided the momentum change in the QPC is generated by electrostatics. We find that back-scattering generated by the domain wall is of an order of magnitude consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports a gapless (Goldstone) magnon mode. In particular, we develop a scenario wherein pairing in the spin-canted state emerges from a novel type of magnon-mediated attraction: Contrary to conventional mechanisms that involve the exchange of a single boson, we show that second-order processes that exchange two magnons are dominant and produce an $s$-wave pairing interaction featuring a unique logarithmic low-frequency divergence. This low-frequency divergence disappears when spin-orbit coupling vanishes, providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect in diffusive superconductors and Josephson junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in two-dimensional diffusive structures with Rashba spin-orbit coupling using the quasiclassical formalism. We consider both homogeneous superconductors and Josephson junctions. In the first case, the diode effect monotonically increases as the magnetic field is increased and the temperature is reduced, in contrast to the non-monotonic behavior found in clean structures. In Josephson junctions, SDE dramatically increases and changes its sign close to the $0-\pi$ transition of the junction, which occurs at specific junction lengths and strengths of the magnetic field. We show that the SDE is strongly suppressed in narrow junctions. Our results are relevant for understanding recent experiments that measure SDE in mesoscopic nanostructures, where significant disorder is unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order: Density matrix renormalization group study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, confirmation via sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the phase diagram of a simple two-orbital model incorporating quantum geometric effect in a strong coupling regime. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase with no coexisting competing orders across a broad range of doping concentration and tuning interaction parameter. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometric effects promote PDW formation. Our study provides by far the strongest evidence for the quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, thereby opening an avenue for further exploration of PDWs.</description>

      <title>The SUPER excitation of quantum emitters is a multi-photon process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The swing-up of quantum emitter population (SUPER) scheme allows to populate the excited state of a quantum emitter with near-unity fidelity using two red-detuned laser pulses. Its off-resonant, yet fully coherent nature has attracted significant interest in quantum photonics as a valuable tool for preparing single-photon sources in their excited state on demand, while simultaneously ensuring straightforward spectral filtering of the laser. However, the physical understanding of this mechanism in terms of energy exchange between the electromagnetic field and the emitter is still lacking. Here, we present a fully quantized model of the swing-up excitation and demonstrate that it is in fact a multi-photon process, where one of the modes loses two or more photons while the other gains at least one. Our findings provide an unexpected physical interpretation of the SUPER scheme and unveil a new non-linear interaction between single emitters and multiple field modes.</description>

      <title>Quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain influenced by atomic charges in water model using orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17621v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently observed temperature-dependent quasiphase transition of the single-file water chain confined within a carbon nanotube in experiments has been validated by simple lattice theory and molecular dynamic simulations. It has been pointed out that atomic charges in water model is an important issue, yet how the values will affect the structural details and thermodynamic properties of the quasiphase transition has not been fully revealed. In this work, we performed orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble to explore the effect of atomic charges in SPC/E water model on the quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain. Based on the atomic charge values reported from literature, three distinct quasiphases are reproduced, comprising a fully hydrogen-bonded water chain at lower temperatures, a more ordered dipolar orientation along the x-axis at intermediate temperatures, and a completely disordered structure at higher temperatures. Then by increasing the atomic charge value, we find that the fragmentation of the entire water chain into shorter water segments, the orientational ordering of water dipoles, and the transition towards complete disorder are all inhibited. Consequently, the transition temperatures between three quasiphases have been shifted to higher temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the increased atomic charge values enhance the hydrogen bonding between neighbouring water molecules also the electrostatic attraction within the water chain, leading to a longer water dipole correlation length even at higher temperatures. These findings shed light on the vital role of atomic charges in water models and also the electrostatic interaction in regulating the orientational ordering of water molecules under nanoconfinement.</description>

      <title>Perovskite nanocrystal self-assemblies in 3D hollow templates</title>

Abstract: Highly ordered nanocrystal (NC) assemblies, namely superlattices (SLs), have been investigated as novel building blocks of optical and optoelectronic devices due to their unique properties based on interactions among neighboring NCs. In particular, lead halide perovskite NC SLs have attracted significant attention, owing to their extraordinary optical characteristics of individual NCs and collective emission processes like superfluorescence (SF). So far, the primary method for preparing perovskite NC SLs has been the drying-mediated self-assembly method, in which the colloidal NCs spontaneously assemble into SLs during solvent evaporation. However, this method lacks controllability because NCs form random-sized SLs at random positions on the substrate rendering NC assemblies in conjunction with device structures such as photonic waveguides or microcavities challenging. Here, we demonstrate template-assisted self-assembly to deterministically place perovskite NC SLs and control their geometrical properties. A solution of CsPbBr3 NCs is drop-casted on a substrate with lithographically-defined hollow structures. After solvent evaporation and removal of excess NCs from the substrate surface, NCs only remain in the templates thereby defining the position and size of these NC assemblies. We performed photoluminescence (PL) measurements on these NC assemblies and observed signatures of SF, similar as in spontaneously assembled SLs. Our findings are crucial for optical devices that harness embedded perovskite NC assemblies and prepare fundamental studies on how these collective effects can be tailored through the SL geometry.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger cats coupled with cavities losses: the effect of finite and structured reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the generation of a Schr\"odinger cat in a nanocavity created by the coupling of an electromagnetic mode with an exciton in a quantum dot considering the dispersive limit of the Jaynes-Cummings model. More than the generation itself, we focus on the effects of the environment over the bosonic state in the nanocavity, which has losses simulated by coupling with two different kind of reservoirs. In the first case, the interaction between the system with a finite reservoir shows that fragments of different sizes of the reservoir deliver the same amount of information about the physical system in the dynamics of the birth and death of the Schr\"odinger cat. The second case considers a structured reservoir, whose spectral density varies significantly with frequency. This situation becomes relevant in solid-state devices where quantum channels are embedded, as memory effects generally cannot be neglected. Under these circumstances, it is observed that the dynamics can differ substantially from the Markovian, presenting oscillations related to the average number of photons. These oscillations influence the information flow between the system and the environment, evidenced here by the measurement of non-Markovianity.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we study the non-Hermitian system under dissipation and give the effective 2*2 Hamiltonian in the k-space by reducing the N*N Hamiltonian in the real space for them. It is discovered that the energy band shows an imaginary line gap. To describe these phenomena, we propose the theory of "non-Hermitian tearing", in which the tearability we define reveals a continuous phase transition at the exceptional point. The non-Hermitian tearing manifests in two forms -- separation of bulk state and decoupling of boundary state. In addition, we also explore the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model under dissipation using the theory of non-Hermitian tearing. Our results provide a theoretical approach for exploring the controlling of non-Hermitian physics on topological quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mechanism to induce superconductivity in atomically thin semiconductors where excitons mediate an effective attraction between electrons. Our model includes interaction effects beyond the paradigm of phonon-mediated superconductivity and connects to the well-established limits of Bose and Fermi polarons. By accounting for the strong-coupling physics of trions, we find that the effective electron-exciton interaction develops a strong frequency and momentum dependence accompanied by the system undergoing an emerging BCS-BEC crossover from weakly bound $s$-wave Cooper pairs to a superfluid of bipolarons. Even at strong-coupling the bipolarons remain relatively light, resulting in critical temperatures of up to 10\% of the Fermi temperature. This renders heterostructures of two-dimensional materials a promising candidate to realize superconductivity at high critical temperatures set by electron doping and trion binding energies.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the strongly nonlinear regime of the magnetic dynamics driven high harmonic generation (HHG) can be captured through an adiabatic treatment. The underlying instantaneous energy dispersion reveal a highly nonlinear term that mirrors the high-frequency excitations present in non-equilibrium transport quantities. We stress out that the instantaneous energy levels dynamics carry much information on HHG and thereby provide a simplified understanding of the effect. Further, we exploit the present approach to predict the emergence of tunable integer and fractional high harmonics in the presence of a time-modulated spin-orbit interaction. Finally, we apply the approach to the case of the light driven HHG to figure out differently emerging non-linearities. Our findings initiate a new direction for harnessing HHG in both laser and precession driven ultrafast carrier dynamics.</description>

Here we report on the combined elastic and magnetic dynamics in a one-dimensional magneto-mechanical crystal composed of an array of magnetic nanowires. Phononic and magnonic modes are impulsively excited by an optical ultrafast trigger and their decay is monitored by time resolved Magneto Optical Kerr Effect, with complementary Brillouin Light Scattering measurements and micromagnetic simulations. The strength and degree of mixing of coherent and dissipative coupling of the quasi-particles is determined quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Electrical reversal of the sign for magnon thermal Hall coefficient in a van der Waals bilayer antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With spin-layer locking, the manipulation of spin degree of freedom via perpendicular electric field can be realized in a typical antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer. In analogy to the electric control of the anomalous layer Hall effect of electron within such bilayer system, we propose here its magnon counterpart i.e., thermal Hall effect controlled by a perpendicular electric field. Unlike electrons, magnon is charged neutral and its transport in solids can be driven by a thermal gradient. It also exhibits Hall response due to the intrinsic Berry curvature of magnon, analogous to the achievement in electron system. Taking bilayer 2H-VSe2 with both H-type stacking and interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling as a platform, we perform first-principles calculations towards the magnetic exchange coupling parameters under applied electric field perpendicular to the plane. Based on linear spin wave approximation, we then fit the magnon band structures accordingly and calculate the corresponding Berry curvature. The thermal Hall coefficient dependence on the temperature under thermal gradient can be calculated correspondingly in linear response regime. It is shown that electric field reversal is able to reverse the sign of the coefficient. These findings provide a platform for the realization of all-electric magnon spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices are key components in modern electronics covering broad applications ranging from transistors to logic circuits thanks to the output rectified signal in the direction parallel to the input. In this work, we propose a transverse Cooper-pair rectifier in which a non-reciprocal current is perpendicular to the driving field, when inversion, time reversal, and mirror symmetries are broken simultaneously. The Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism is developed to describe the transverse current-voltage relation in a normal-metal/superconductor tunneling junction, where symmetry constraints are achieved by an effective built-in supercurrent manifesting in an asymmetric and anisotropic Andreev reflection. The asymmetry in the Andreev reflection is induced when inversion and time reversal symmetry are broken by the supercurrent component parallel to the junction while the anisotropy occurs when the mirror symmetry with respect to the normal of the junction interface is broken by the perpendicular supercurrent component to the junction. Compared to the conventional longitudinal one, the transverse rectifier supports fully polarized diode efficiency and colossal nonreciprocal conductance rectification, completely decoupling the path of the input excitation from the output rectified signal. This work provides a formalism for realizing transverse non-reciprocity in superconducting junctions, which is expected to be achieved by modifying current experimental setups and may pave the way for future low-dissipation superconducting electronics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the magneto-optical properties of two-dimensional nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals in the presence of antiferromagnetic order. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor of two-dimensional CuMnAs, a prototype antiferromagnetic Dirac material, as a function of light frequency. From the finite-frequency conductivity tensor, we derive the dynamic dielectric function and magnetic linear dichroism, demonstrating how they are influenced by the orientation of the N{\'e}el order parameter. Adjusting the N{\'e}el vector changes both the sign and amplitude of the system's magneto-optical response. We propose that magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the orientation of the N{\'e}el vector.</description>

      <title>Probing Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state via quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent attention has been drawn to temperature gradient generated $\Delta_T$ noise at vanishing charge current. This study delves into examining the properties of spin-polarised $\Delta T$ noise in conjunction with $\Delta_T$-shot noise, $\Delta_T$-thermal noise, and quantum noise (again both shot and thermal noise) in a one-dimensional (1D) structure comprising metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction to probe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. YSR bound states, which are localized states within the superconducting gap of a superconductor are induced by a magnetic impurity acting as a spin-flipper. A YSR bound state should be distinguished from a Majorana bound state (MBS), which too can occur due to interaction with magnetic impurities, e.g., magnetic adatoms on superconductors, and this can lead to false positives in detecting MBS. Clarifying this by providing a unique signature for the YSR-bound state is the main aim of this work. In this paper, we show that YSR bound states can be effectively probed using quantum noise and the recently discovered $\Delta_T$ noise, with a focus on especially spin transport. We see that the spin $\Delta_T$ noise is a superior tool compared to the charge $\Delta_T$ noise as a probe for YSR bound states. Additionally, our analysis of quantum noise reveals that similar to $\Delta_T$ noise, spin quantum noise is more effective than charge quantum noise in detecting YSR bound states.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of multistate Landau-Zener model which cannot be solved by integrability conditions or other standard techniques. By analyzing analytical constraints on its scattering matrix and performing fitting to results from numerical simulations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we find nearly exact analytical expressions of all its transition probabilities for specific parameter choices. We also determine the transition probabilities up to leading orders of series expansions in terms of the inverse sweep rate (namely, in the diabatic limit) for general parameter choices. We further show that this model can describe a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with couplings changing linearly in time. Our work presents a new route, i.e., analytical constraint plus fitting, to analyze those multistate Landau-Zener models which are beyond the applicability of conventional solving methods.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions in Kitaev chains side-coupled to normal metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02266</link>

Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a normal metal (NM) side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -a topological invariant used to characterize topological phases.</description>

      <title>Bath-induced interactions and transient dynamics in open quantum systems at strong coupling: Effective Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of dissipative quantum systems, particularly beyond the weak coupling approximation, is central to various quantum applications. While numerically exact methods provide accurate solutions, they often lack the analytical insight provided by theoretical approaches. In this study, we employ the recently-developed method dubbed the effective Hamiltonian theory to understand the dynamics of system-bath configurations without resorting to a perturbative description of the system-bath coupling energy. Through a combination of mapping steps and truncation, the effective Hamiltonian theory offers both analytical insights into signatures of strong couplings in open quantum systems and a straightforward path for numerical simulations. To validate the accuracy of the method, we apply it to two canonical models: a single spin immersed in a bosonic bath and two noninteracting spins in a common bath. In both cases, we study the transient regime and the steady state limit at nonzero temperature, and spanning system-bath interactions from the weak to the strong regime. By comparing the results of the effective Hamiltonian theory with numerically exact simulations, we show that although the former overlooks non-Markovian features in the transient equilibration dynamics, it correctly captures non-perturbative bath-generated couplings between otherwise non-interacting spins as observed in their synchronization dynamics and correlations. Altogether, the effective Hamiltonian theory offers a powerful approach to understanding strong coupling dynamics and thermodynamics, capturing the signatures of such interactions in both relaxation dynamics and in the steady state limit.</description>
