      <title>Uniform bounds, zero separation and monotonicity for the regular Coulomb wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper begins by deriving the uniform bounds for the regular Coulomb wave function $F_{\ell,\eta}$ and its derivative $F_{\ell,\eta}'$. We then examine detailed zero configurations of $F_{\ell,\eta}$ and $F_{\ell+1,\eta}$, extending insights into the earlier work that was restricted to $\ell&gt;-3/2$. Our investigation also includes an analysis of the monotonicity of the zeros of $F_{\ell,\eta}$ with respect to parameters $\ell$ and $\eta$, respectively. Furthermore, we expand our exploration to associated orthogonal polynomials, as well as the functions involving both $F_{\ell,\eta}$ and $F_{\ell,\eta}'$. Finally, we explore the breakdown of the Sturm separation theorem by means of the zeros of associated orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>PSWF-Radon approach to reconstruction from band-limited Hankel transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give new formulas for reconstructions from band-limited Hankel transform of integer or half-integer order. Our formulas rely on the PSWF-Radon approach to super-resolution in multidimensional Fourier analysis. This approach consists of combining the theory of classical one-dimensional prolate spheroidal wave functions with the Radon transform theory. We also use the relation between Fourier and Hankel transforms and Cormack-type inversion of the Radon transform. Finally, we investigate numerically the capabilities of our approach to super-resolution for band-limited Hankel inversion in relation to varying levels of noise.</description>

      <title>Translation-based completeness on compact intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and a function $f$ that is a product of a nonzero polynomial with a Gaussian, it will be shown that the translates $\{ f(\cdot - \lambda) : \lambda \in \Lambda \}$ are complete in $C(I)$ if and only if the series of reciprocals of $\Lambda$ diverges. This extends a theorem in [R. A. Zalik, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 243, 299-308]. An additional characterization is obtained when $\Lambda$ is an arithmetic progression, and the generator $f$ constitutes a linear combination of translates of a function with sufficiently fast decay.</description>

      <title>Fractional $\alpha$-Bernstein-Kantorovich operators of order $\beta$: A new construction and approximation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current article, we establish a distinct version of the operators defined by Berwal \emph{et al.}, which is the Kantorovich type modification of $\alpha$-Bernstein operators to approximate Lebesgue's integrable functions. We define its modification that can preserve the linear function and analyze its characteristics. Additionally, we construct the bivariate of blending type operators by Berwal \emph{et al.}. We analyze both its the convergence and error of approximation properties by using the conventional tools of approximation theory. Finally, we demonstrate our results by presenting examples that highlight graphical visuals using MATLAB.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for universality limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for universality limits for orthogonal polynomials on the real line and related systems. One of our results is that the Christoffel-Darboux kernel has sine kernel asymptotics at a point $\xi$, with regularly varying scaling, if and only if the orthogonality measure (spectral measure) has a unique tangent measure at $\xi$ and that tangent measure is the Lebesgue measure. This includes all prior results with absolutely continuous or singular measures.
  Our work is not limited to bulk universality; we show that the Christoffel-Darboux kernel has a regularly varying scaling limit with a nontrivial limit kernel if and only if the orthogonality measure has a unique tangent measure at $\xi$ and that tangent measure is not a point mass. The possible limit kernels correspond to homogeneous de Branges spaces; in particular, this equivalence completely characterizes several prominent universality classes such as hard edge universality, Fisher-Hartwig singularities, and jump discontinuities in the weights.
  The main part of the proof is the derivation of a new homeomorphism. In order to directly apply to the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, this homeomorphism is between measures and chains of de Branges spaces, not between Weyl functions and Hamiltonians. In order to handle limits with power law weights, this homeomorphism goes beyond the more common setting of Poisson-finite measures, and allows arbitrary power bounded measures.</description>

      <title>Classical inequalities for all Fourier matrix coefficients of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish three fundamental Fourier inequalities: the Hausdorff-Young inequality, the Paley inequality, and the Hausdorff-Young-Paley inequality for $(l, n)$-type functions on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Utilizing these inequalities, we demonstrate the $L^p$-$L^q$ boundedness of $(l, n)$-type Fourier multipliers on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Furthermore, we explore applications related to the $L^p$-$L^q$ estimates of the heat kernel of the Casimir element on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and address the global well-posedness of certain parabolic and hyperbolic nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-$L^q$ Fourier multipliers and Hausdorff-Young-Paley inequalities on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our primary objective in this article is to establish H\"ormander type $L^p \rightarrow L^q$ Fourier multiplier theorems in the context of noncompact type Riemannian symmetric spaces $\mathbb{X}$ of arbitrary rank for the range $1 &lt; p \leq 2 \leq q &lt; \infty$. As a consequence of the Fourier multiplier theorem, we also derive a spectral multiplier theorem on $\mathbb{X}$. We then apply this theorem to prove $L^p \rightarrow L^q$ boundedness for functions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and to obtain embedding theorems and operator estimates for the potentials and heat semigroups. Additionally, we provide mixed-norm versions of the Hausdorff-Young and Paley inequalities. In this context, where the Fourier transform is holomorphic, and its domain consists of various strips, we present two versions of these inequalities and explore their interrelation. Furthermore, our findings and methods are also applicable to harmonic $NA$ groups, also known as Damek-Ricci spaces.</description>

      <title>Weighted Weak-type Inequalities For Fractionally Sparsely Dominated Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish quantitative weak type estimates for operators that are dominated by (fractional) sparse operators in bilinear sense. Specifically, we derive bounds for both the restricted weak type $L^{p,1}\rightarrow L^{q,\infty}$ and the multiplier weak type, the latter of which has been previously considered by Cruz-Uribe and Sweeting. These estimates provide a precise quantification of the mapping properties of the considered operators, extending and refining the existing theory.</description>

      <title>Stirling-Ramanujan constants are exponential periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ramanujan studied a general class of Stirling constants that are the resummation of some natural divergent series. These constants include the classical Euler-Mascheroni, Stirling and Glaisher-Kinkelin constants. We find natural integral representations for all these constants that appear as exponential periods in the field $\mathbb Q (t,e^{-t})$ which reveals their natural transalgebraic nature. We conjecture that all these constants are transcendental numbers. Euler-Mascheroni's and Stirling's integral formula are classical, but the integral formula for Glaisher-Kinkelin appears to be new, as well as the integral formulas for the higher Stirling-Ramanujan constants. The method presented generalizes naturally to prove that many other constants are exponential periods over the field $\mathbb Q(t,e^{-t})$.</description>

      <title>On eventually greedy best underapproximations by Egyptian fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham found it conceivable that the best $n$-term Egyptian underapproximation of almost every positive number for sufficiently large $n$ gets constructed in a greedy manner, i.e., from the best $(n-1)$-term Egyptian underapproximation. We show that the opposite is true: the set of real numbers with this property has Lebesgue measure zero. [This note solves Problem 206 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>
