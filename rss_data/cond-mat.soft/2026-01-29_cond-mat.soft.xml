      <title>Deep Learning the Small-Angle Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep learning framework for modeling and analyzing the small-angle scattering data of polydisperse hard-rod systems, a widely used models for anisotropic colloidal particles. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the mapping from the system parameters such as the volume fraction, rod length, and polydispersity, to the scattering function. The dataset for training and testing such neural network model is obtained from Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of 20,000 hard spherocylinders using the hard particle Monte Carlo package from the HOOMD-blue. Four datasets were generated, each with 5,500 pairs of system parameters and corresponding scattering functions. We use one of the dataset to investigate the feasibility of the learning, and three additional datasets with different polydisperse distribution to demonstrate the generality of our approach. The neural network model transcends the fundamental limitations of the Percus-Yevick approximation by accurately capturing anisotropic interactions and high-concentration effects that analytical models often fail to resolve. This framework achieves significantly higher accuracy in reproducing scattering functions and enables a least-square fitting routine for quantitative data analysis.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanoparticle Stripe Patterns at Inclined Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic assemblies of nanoparticles are central to surface patterning, with applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and nanofabrication. Evaporation of colloidal droplets on substrates provides a simple yet effective route to achieve such assemblies. This work reports the first experimental demonstration of patterns formed through stick-slip dynamics of the three-phase contact line during evaporation of gold nanoparticle suspensions on inclined substrates. Variation in nanoparticle concentration and substrate inclination alter the balance of interfacial and gravitational forces, producing multiple stick-slip events that generate periodic stripes. Stripe density exhibits a sinusoidal dependence on inclination angle, while inter-stripe spacing remains nearly invariant. Independent control over inter-stripe spacing is achieved through adjustment of nanoparticle or surfactant concentration. These results highlight the complex interplay of gravitational and interfacial forces in directing periodic nanoparticle assembly and establish a versatile, programmable framework for surface patterning with tunable nano/microscale dimensions.</description>

      <title>Steering Active-Colloid Assembly by Biasing Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex nonequilibrium self-assembly enables the formation of materials with specific patterns and functions from the bottom up. How to directionally control the assembly to form the target configuration is a challenge. Here, we propose a dissipation bias principle for targeted assembly, which highlights that controlling the dissipation tendency can play an important role by modulating the frequency and intensity of local rearrangements. Following this principle, one can induce ordered target configurations from disordered structures and also achieve directional selection among multiple assembly pathways. We use the assembly of active colloids as a platform to show our results.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium noise emerging from broken detailed balance in active gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In thermodynamic equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem links thermal fluctuations and dissipation. Biological systems, however, are driven out of equilibrium by internal processes that produce additional, active fluctuations. Despite being relevant for biological functions such as intracellular transport, predicting the statistical properties of active fluctuations remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge in a minimal model of an active gel as a network of elastic elements connected by transient crosslinks. The crosslinkers' binding and unbinding rates break detailed balance, which drives the system out of equilibrium. Through coarse-graining, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations including an active noise term, which emerges explicitly from the breaking of detailed balance. Finally, we provide predictions for the stochastic motion of a tracer particle embedded in the active gel, which enables comparisons with microrheology experiments both in synthetic active gels and in cells. Overall, our work provides an explicit link between the statistical properties of active fluctuations and the molecular breaking of detailed balance. Thus, it paves the way toward complementing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem with a fluctuation-activity relation in active systems.</description>

      <title>Ion-Modulated Polyelectrolyte Complexation of DNA and Polyacrylic Acid from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of complexes between like-charged polyelectrolytes challenges conventional electrostatic intuition and highlights the central role of ions in mediating macromolecular organization. Here, we investigate the salt-dependent association of DNA with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in NaCl, MgCl$_2$, and CaCl$_2$ solutions. A time-resolved state classification scheme, based on heavy-atom distance and hydrogen-bond formation, was applied to distinguish bound and unbound configurations, enabling quantitative analysis of how ion valency modulates complex stability and structure. The results reveal a clear hierarchy of association strength with Ca$^{2+}$ promoting persistent complex formation through direct inner-sphere coordination between DNA phosphates and PAA carboxylates, Mg$^{2+}$ mediating weaker, transient bridging interactions and Na$^+$ exhibiting only electrostatic screening action with negligible bridge formation. Structural analysis shows that multivalent ions not only enhance complex stability but also reshape the molecular organization of both macromolecules. Ca$^{2+}$ induces expansion of DNA and compaction of PAA within a strongly bridged complex characterized by directional alignment and backbone-dominated binding, whereas Mg$^{2+}$ promotes more transient groove associations and Na$^+$ supports flexible, weakly correlated contacts. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ion-specific mechanisms underlying polyelectrolyte organization and inform the design of responsive biomaterials and nucleic acid-based assemblies in multivalent ionic environments.</description>

      <title>From biting to engulfment: curvature-actin coupling controls phagocytosis of soft, deformable targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phagocytosis is a fundamental process of the innate immune system, yet the physical determinants that govern the engulfment of soft, deformable targets remain poorly understood. Existing theoretical models typically approximate targets as rigid particles, overlooking the fact that both immune cells and many biological targets undergo significant membrane deformation during contact. Here, we develop a Monte Carlo-based membrane simulation framework to model the interactions of multiple vesicles, enabling us to explore phagocytosis-like processes in systems where both the phagocyte and the target possess flexible, thermally fluctuating membranes. We first validate our approach against established observations for the engulfment of rigid objects. We then investigate how the mechanical properties of a soft target -- specifically membrane bending rigidity govern the outcome of phagocytic interactions. Our simulations reveal three distinct mechanical regimes: (i) biting or trogocytosis, in which the phagocyte extracts a portion of the target vesicle; (ii) pushing, where the target is displaced rather than engulfed; and (iii) full engulfment, in which the target is completely internalized. Increasing membrane tension via internal pressure produces analogous transitions, demonstrating a unified mechanical origin for these behaviours. Qualitative comparison with experiments involving Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs, deformable microparticles) and lymphoma cells supports the relevance of these regimes to biological phagocytosis. Together, these results highlight how target deformability fundamentally shapes phagocytic success and suggest that immune cells may exploit mechanical cues to recognize among different classes of soft targets.</description>

      <title>Star-like microgels vs star polymers: similarities and differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-like microgels have recently emerged as a promising class of thermoresponsive soft colloids, that have an internal architecture similar to that of star polymers. Here, we perform extensive monomer-resolved simulations to theoretically establish this analogy. First, we characterize the effective potential between star-like microgels, finding that it is Gaussian for an extended range of distances, in stark contrast to the Hertzian-like one of standard microgels, but almost identical to that of star polymers with a core partially covered by chains. Next, we investigate the ratio between gyration and hydrodynamic radii across the volume-phase transition, showing qualitative agreement with both star polymers and experimental data. Finally, we estimate the bulk modulus, finding star-like microgels significantly softer than standard microgels and comparable to star polymers. The present work thus demonstrates that star-like microgels behave as ultrasoft particles, akin to star polymers, paving the way for their exploration at high concentrations.</description>

      <title>Controlling the snap-through behavior of kirigami arches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the snap-through behavior of clamped-clamped kirigami arches made from initially flat, thin, cut sheets under increasing vertical concentrated load acting at midspan. A two-parameter, symmetric pattern is introduced to conduct a numerical parameter analysis across three different support distances. When the support distance is one-quarter of the total length of the sheet, the structure loses stability at a symmetry point bifurcation over a wide range of parameters. Additionally, there exists a small range of parameters where limit point bifurcation occurs. In this case, the cuts can induce symmetry in the stability loss. For larger support distances (half or three-quarters of the total length), limit point bifurcation occurs only for small cuts, and there is a range of cut parameters that leads to monotonic monostability, indicating that no stability loss occurs. These findings are supported by experimental data. Overall, our research demonstrates that carefully designed cut patterns can either control the mode of stability loss in kirigami arches or suppress it entirely.</description>

      <title>Complex segregation patterns in confined nonuniform granular shearing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When polydisperse granular systems are sheared, the transverse dynamics is characterized by the interplay of size segregation and diffusion. Segregation in nonuniform and confined shearing flows is studied using annular shear cell experiments complemented with discrete numerical simulations of bidisperse, inelastic, and frictional spheres under gravity. We explored the role of shear localization, granular temperature, boundaries, and mixture properties in the evolution of the segregation rate and the maximum degree of segregation achieved by a bidisperse granular system in the steady state. A faster segregation process and a more developed degree of segregation is observed for bidisperse mixtures with a larger size ratio and a higher proportion of large particles. Normally, in the presence of gravity, size segregation induces large particles to rise and small particles to sink. However, two additional complex segregation patterns were found: inverse segregation and horizontal segregation. The first might be related to the kinematics of the flow, while the second is a geometrical effect. This additional segregation mechanism, in addition to diffusion fluxes and high confining pressure, hampers complete segregation in the steady state, where some degree of mixing always persists.</description>

      <title>Transient Elasticity -- A Unifying Framework for Thixotropy, Polymers, and Granular Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solid-dynamics, letting the elastic strain $\bm{\varepsilon^e}$ relax interpolates between solid- and fluid-dynamics, which is appropriate for systems that display both types of behavior. Realizing in addition that complex systems such as structured fluids often sustain two temperatures, yields a model called \textit{Transient Elasticity}. Its adequacy for polymers and granular media was shown in previous papers. Here, it is applied to \textit{thixotropic yield-stress fluids}, showing that typical effects are all accounted for: Stress over- and undershoot, viscosity bifurcation, shear band, yield stresses, oscillatory rheography, and elastic shear waves. So equations capable of accounting for three systems -- deemed unrelated hitherto -- are given. This suggests a unified understanding of many non-Newtonian phenomena, based mainly on how energy is stored and dissipated, in two stages.</description>

      <title>Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21396v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies, combined with complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we show how Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We present a universal force-based scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>

      <title>Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$, and bounded cylinder. Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking: order emerges from two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with manifold topology determining the character of emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures: bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. Unlike conventional symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise. On the sphere, the structure normal precesses diffusively on the Goldstone manifold with correlation time $\tau_c \approx 18$, a classical realization of type-A dissipative Nambu-Goldstone dynamics. The model requires no thermodynamic gradients, no fine-tuning, and no slow external input. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems. The model admits a large-$N$ limit yielding statistical field theory on Riemannian surfaces, while remaining experimentally realizable in colloidal and soft matter systems.</description>
