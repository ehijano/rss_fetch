      <title>Leveraging Multi-Instance GPUs through moldable task scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NVIDIA MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) allows partitioning a physical GPU into multiple logical instances with fully-isolated resources, which can be dynamically reconfigured. This work highlights the untapped potential of MIG through moldable task scheduling with dynamic reconfigurations. Specifically, we propose a makespan minimization problem for multi-task execution under MIG constraints. Our profiling shows that assuming monotonicity in task work with respect to resources is not viable, as is usual in multicore scheduling. Relying on a state-of-the-art proposal that does not require such an assumption, we present FAR, a 3-phase algorithm to solve the problem. Phase 1 of FAR builds on a classical task moldability method, phase 2 combines Longest Processing Time First and List Scheduling with a novel repartitioning tree heuristic tailored to MIG constraints, and phase 3 employs local search via task moves and swaps. FAR schedules tasks in batches offline, concatenating their schedules on the fly in an improved way that favors resource reuse. Excluding reconfiguration costs, the List Scheduling proof shows an approximation factor of 7/4 on the NVIDIA A30 model. We adapt the technique to the particular constraints of an NVIDIA A100/H100 to obtain an approximation factor of 2. Including the reconfiguration cost, our real-world experiments reveal a makespan with respect to the optimum no worse than 1.22x for a well-known suite of benchmarks, and 1.10x for synthetic inputs inspired by real kernels. We obtain good experimental results for each batch of tasks, but also in the concatenation of batches, with large improvements over the state-of-the-art and proposals without GPU reconfiguration. Beyond the algorithm, the paper demonstrates the research potential of the MIG technology and suggests useful metrics, workload characterizations and evaluation techniques for future work in this field.</description>

      <title>From Firms to Computation: AI Governance and the Evolution of Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of agential artificial intelligence into socioeconomic systems requires us to reexamine the evolutionary processes that describe changes in our economic institutions. This article synthesizes three frameworks: multi-level selection theory, Aoki's view of firms as computational processes, and Ostrom's design principles for robust institutions. We develop a framework where selection operates concurrently across organizational levels, firms implement distributed inference via game-theoretic architectures, and Ostrom-style rules evolve as alignment mechanisms that address AI-related risks. This synthesis yields a multi-level Price equation expressed over nested games, providing quantitative metrics for how selection and governance co-determine economic outcomes. We examine connections to Acemoglu's work on inclusive institutions, analyze how institutional structures shape AI deployment, and demonstrate the framework's explanatory power via case studies. We conclude by proposing a set of design principles that operationalize alignment between humans and AI across institutional layers, enabling scalable, adaptive, and inclusive governance of agential AI systems. We conclude with practical policy recommendations and further research to extend these principles into real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Blockchain Survey: Foundations, Trends, and Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing poses fundamental risks to classical blockchain systems by undermining widely used cryptographic primitives. In response, two major research directions have emerged: post-quantum blockchains, which integrate quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum blockchains, which leverage quantum properties such as entanglement and quantum key distribution. This survey reviews key developments in both areas, analyzing their cryptographic foundations, architectural designs, and implementation challenges. This work provides a comparative overview of technical proposals, highlight trade-offs in security, scalability, and deployment, and identify open research problems across hardware, consensus, and network design. The goal is to offer a structured and comprehensive reference for advancing secure blockchain systems in the quantum era.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Distortion Equalization in Multi-Span Optical Links Via a Feed-Forward Photonic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear and nonlinear distortions in optical communication signals are equalized using an integrated feed-forward Photonic Neural Network (PNN). The PNN is based on a linear stage made of an 8-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, featuring tunable amplitude and phase weights at each tap, and of a nonlinear stage achieved through the square modulus operation at the end-of-line photodetector. Within an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection (IMDD) system, the PNN is applied to 2-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM2) optical signals undergoing multi-span propagation. Each 50 km segment includes fiber transmission, optical power restoration, and optional chromatic dispersion compensation via a Tunable Dispersion Compensator. Positioned at the receiver, the PNN enables fully optical signal processing with minimal latency and power consumption. Experimental validation is conducted using a Silicon-On-Insulator device operating on 10 Gbps signals. It demonstrates chromatic dispersion equalization over distances up to 200 km and self-phase modulation (with dispersion removed) up to 450 km. Simulations explore PNN adaptation for 100 Gbps modulations and its potential for cross-phase modulation equalization.</description>

      <title>The CryptoNeo Threat Modelling Framework (CNTMF): Securing Neobanks and Fintech in Integrated Blockchain Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid integration of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Web3 technologies into digital banks and fintech operations has created an integrated environment blending traditional financial systems with decentralised elements. This paper introduces the CryptoNeo Threat Modelling Framework (CNTMF), a proposed framework designed to address the risks in these ecosystems, such as oracle manipulation and cross-chain exploits. CNTMF represents a proposed extension of established methodologies like STRIDE, OWASP Top 10, NIST frameworks, LINDDUN, and PASTA, while incorporating tailored components including Hybrid Layer Analysis, the CRYPTOQ mnemonic for cryptocurrency-specific risks, and an AI-Augmented Feedback Loop. Drawing on real-world data from 2025 incidents, CNTMF supports data-driven mitigation to reduce losses, which totalled approximately $2.47 billion in the first half of 2025 across 344 security events (CertiK via GlobeNewswire, 2025; Infosecurity Magazine, 2025). Its phases guide asset mapping, risk profiling, prioritisation, mitigation, and iterative feedback. This supports security against evolving risks like state-sponsored attacks.</description>

      <title>QuantEIT: Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference for Chest Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here, we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network (QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>Edge Intelligence with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require significant computational resources and centralized data management, the resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models, learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Boltzmann Machines using Parallel Annealing for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM executions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resilient Privacy Ledger (QRPL): A Sovereign Digital Currency for the Post-Quantum Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing presents profound challenges to existing cryptographic infrastructures, whilst the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has raised concerns regarding privacy preservation and excessive centralisation in digital payment systems. This paper proposes the Quantum-Resilient Privacy Ledger (QRPL) as an innovative token-based digital currency architecture that incorporates National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-standardised post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with hash-based zero-knowledge proofs to ensure user sovereignty, scalability, and transaction confidentiality. Key contributions include adaptations of ephemeral proof chains for unlinkable transactions, a privacy-weighted Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus to promote equitable participation, and a novel zero-knowledge proof-based mechanism for privacy-preserving selective disclosure. QRPL aims to address critical shortcomings in prevailing CBDC designs, including risks of pervasive surveillance, with a 10-20 second block time to balance security and throughput in future monetary systems. While conceptual, empirical prototypes are planned. Future work includes prototype development to validate these models empirically.</description>

      <title>No Scratch Quantum Computing by Reducing Qubit Overhead for Efficient Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch qubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate resources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output registers due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces a novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single rotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N $ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \log_2 O $. Leveraging QHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that compress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11, (1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder circuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al., PRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\times $4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic evaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass classical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid superposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains feasible in principle. We see the best application for QHC in finding the minimal qubit and gate resources needed to evaluate any truth table, advancing FPGA capabilities using integrated quantum circuits or photonics.</description>
