      <title>The 3d mixed BF Lagrangian 1-form: a variational formulation of Hitchin's integrable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of gauged Lagrangian $1$-forms, extending the notion of Lagrangian $1$-forms to the setting of gauge theories. This general formalism is applied to a natural geometric Lagrangian $1$-form on the cotangent bundle of the space of holomorphic structures on a smooth principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ over a compact Riemann surface $C$ of arbitrary genus $g$, with or without marked points, in order to gauge the symmetry group of smooth bundle automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}$. The resulting construction yields a multiform version of the $3$d mixed BF action with so-called type A and B defects, providing a variational formulation of Hitchin's completely integrable system over $C$. By passing to holomorphic local trivialisations and going partially on-shell, we obtain a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. The cases of genus $0$ and $1$ with marked points are treated in greater detail, producing explicit Lagrangian $1$-forms for the rational Gaudin hierarchy and the elliptic Gaudin hierarchy, respectively, with the elliptic spin Calogero-Moser hierarchy arising as a special subcase.</description>

      <title>A Trace-Path Integral Formula over Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an arithmetic path integral over the $\ell$-torsion of a Jacobian $J[\ell]$ is equal to the trace of the Frobenius action on a representation of the Heisenberg group $H(J[\ell])$, up to an explicitly determined sign. This is an arithmetic analogue of trace--path integral formulae which arise in quantum field theory, where path integrals over a space of sections of a fibration over a circle can be expressed as the trace of the monodromy action on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Do null defects dream of conformal symmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of null line defects in Lorentzian conformal field theories in various dimensions. We show that null lines geometrically preserve a larger set of conformal isometries than their timelike and spacelike counterparts, explain a connection to non-relativistic systems, and constrain correlation functions using conformal Ward identities. We argue that having conformal symmetry, and especially maximal conformal symmetry, is extremely constraining -- nearly trivializing systems. We consider the (3+1)d scalar pinning field and null Wilson line examples in depth, compare their results to ultraboosted limits of timelike and spacelike systems, and argue that shockwave-type solutions are generic. A number of physical consistency conditions compel us to consider defect correlators as distributions on a restricted subspace of Schwartz test functions. Consequently, we provide a resolution to the longstanding problem of ultraboosted limits of gauge potentials in classical electromagnetism. We briefly analyze semi-infinite sources for the scalar in ($4-\epsilon$)-dimensions, consider solutions on the Lorentzian cylinder, and introduce the ''perfect null polygon'' which emerges for compatibility between Gauss' law and ultraboosted limits.</description>

      <title>Gauged Extended Field Theory and Generalised Cartan Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cartan geometry provides a unifying algebraic construction of curvature and torsion, based on an underlying model Lie algebra -- a viewpoint that can be extended naturally to the higher algebraic structures underlying supergravity. We present a Cartan-geometric framework for generalised geometries governed by a differential graded Lie algebra, extending previous results. The extended tangent bundle admits the action of both a global duality group $\mathcal{G}$ and a local gauge group $H$. This algebraic structure is implemented via a brane current algebra -- the phase space Poisson structure of $p$-branes. Within this Cartan-inspired framework, we define a hierarchy of generalised connections and compute their linearised torsion and curvature tensors, including the higher curvatures required by the tensor hierarchy. This provides a systematic construction of curvature and torsion tensors in generic generalised geometries.</description>

      <title>Dynamical approach to area law for lattice Yang-Mills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we observe that the dynamical approach to lattice Yang-Mills set forth in [SZZ23] may also be applied to prove Wilson's area law in the 't Hooft regime of parameters. The main point is to verify the mass gap condition from [DF80], from which area law directly follows. Our results apply for gauge groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N), \mathrm{SU}(N), \mathrm{SO}(2N)\}$, which all have nontrivial center (which is one of the key assumptions in [DF80]).</description>

      <title>The Maxwell--Born--Infeld Theory: Presence of Finite-Energy Electric Point Charge and Absence of Monopole and Dyon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a nonlinear electrodynamic theory which may be viewed as a weighted theory minimally interpolating the classical Maxwell and Born--Infeld theories. We show that, in contrast to the Born--Infeld theory, this new theory accommodates a finite-energy electric point charge, like that in the Born--Infeld theory, but does not accommodate a finite-energy magnetic point charge, known as the monopole, thereby exhibiting an electromagnetic asymmetry property, unlike that in the Born--Infeld theory. We estimate the radius of the electron within the formalism of such a theory. We also show that an electric point charge carries a finite energy in the Maxwell theory limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the theory does not accommodate a finite-energy monopole nor a dyon either in its most general setting.</description>

      <title>The principal W-algebra of $\mathfrak{psl}_{2|2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure and representation theory of the principal W-algebra $\mathsf{W}^{\mathsf{k}}_{\mathrm{pr}}$ of $\mathsf{V}^{\mathsf{k}}(\mathfrak{psl}_{2|2})$. The defining operator product expansions are computed, as is the Zhu algebra, and these results are used to classify irreducible highest-weight modules. In particular, for $\mathsf{k} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$, $\mathsf{W}^{\mathsf{k}}_{\mathrm{pr}}$ is not simple and the corresponding simple quotient is the symplectic fermion vertex algebra. We use this fact, along with inverse hamiltonian reduction, to study relaxed highest-weight and logarithmic modules for the small $N=4$ superconformal algebra at central charges $-9$ and $-3$.</description>

      <title>On Isospectral flows related to (dual) cubic strings: Novikov, DP peakons and B, C-Toda lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Degasperis--Procesi (DP) equation can be viewed as an isospectral deformation of the boundary value problem for the so-called cubic string, while the Novikov equation can be formally regarded as linked to the dual cubic string. However, their relationships have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper examines various intrinsic connections between these two systems from different perspectives. We uncover a bijective relationship between the DP and Novikov pure peakon trajectories. In particular, this allows us to derive, not previously known, explicit expressions for the constants of motion in the Novikov peakon dynamical system. We also establish a one-to-one correspondence between the corresponding discrete cubic and dual cubic boundary value problems. Furthermore, we propose a new integrable lattice that features bilinear relations involving both determinants and Pfaffians, demonstrating that it can be connected to both the B-Toda and C-Toda lattices, which correspond to isospectral flows, involving positive powers of the spectral parameter, associated with (dual) cubic strings.</description>

      <title>Nonintegrability of the Fredkin spin chain and its truncated versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservation laws serve as the hallmark of integrability. The absence of conserved charges typically implies that the model is nonintegrable. The recently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground state is analytically known. However, whether the Fredkin spin chain is integrable remains an open question. In this work, through rigorous analytical calculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming its nonintegrable nature. Furthermore, we find that when one or a portion of the Hamiltonian terms are removed (referred to as the truncated Fredkin spin chain), local conserved charges are still absent. Our findings suggest that in models involving three-site interactions, integrable models are generally rare.</description>

Abstract: We study a multi--particle model including a kinetic energy and a non linear local self-interaction, both in the bosonic and fermionic cases. In both cases, we prove that the model is well-posed if the number of particles is large enough. In particular, we show that there is a nonlinearity for which the model with $N=2$ particles is well-posed, while the model with $N=1$ is not.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Dipole Amplitude in the Dipole Picture as a mathematical Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the inference problem of constraining the dipole amplitude with inclusive deep inelastic scattering data can be written into a discrete linear inverse problem, in an analogous manner as can be done for computed tomography. To this formulation of the problem, we apply standard inverse problems methods and algorithms to reconstruct known dipole amplitudes from simulated reduced cross section data with realistic precision. The main difference of this approach to previous works is that this implementation does not require any fit parametrization of the dipole amplitude. The freedom from parametrization also enables us for the first time to quantify the uncertainties of the inferred dipole amplitude in a novel more general framework. This mathematical approach to small-$x$ phenomenology opens a path to parametrization bias free inference of the dipole amplitude from HERA and Electron--Ion Collider data.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximations to statistical conservation laws for scalar hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the statistical description of turbulence, we study statistical conservation laws in the form of kinetic-type PDEs for joint probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) associated with solutions of scalar balance laws. Starting from viscous balance laws, the resulting PDF/CDF equations involve unclosed conditional averages arising in the viscous terms. We show that these terms exhibit a dissipative anomaly: they remain non-negligible in the vanishing viscosity limit and are essential to preserve the nonnegativity of evolving PDFs. To approximate these PDF/CDF equations in a unified framework, we propose a novel sampling-based estimator for the unclosed terms, constructed from numerical or exact realizations of the underlying balance-law solutions. In certain cases, a priori error bounds can be derived, demonstrating that the deviation between the true and approximate CDFs is controlled by the estimation error of the unclosed terms. Numerical experiments with analytically solvable test problems confirm that the sampling-based approximation converges satisfactorily with the number of samples.</description>

      <title>Detecting extreme event-driven causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of some extreme events (such as marine heatwaves or exceptional circulations) can cause other extreme events (such as heatwave, drought and flood). These concurrent extreme events have a great impact on environment and human health. However, how to detect and quantify the causes and impacts of these extreme events by a data-driven way is still unsolved. In this study, the dynamic system method is extended to develop a method for detecting the causality between extreme events. Taking the coupled Lorenz-Lorenz systems with extreme event-driven coupling as an example, it is demonstrated that this proposed detecting method is able to capture the extreme event-driven causality, with even better causality detecting performance between concurrent extreme events. Comparison among three kinds of measured series, full measurements outperform partial ones in event-to-event causality detecting. The successful applicability of our proposed approach in Walker circulation phenomenon indicates that our method contributes a novel way to the study of causal inference in complex systems. This method offers valuable insights into multi-scale, nonlinear dynamics, particularly in uncovering associations among extreme events.</description>

      <title>Soliton Surfaces and the Geometry of Integrable Deformations of the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model is an analytically tractable $2d$ quantum field theory which shares several properties with $4d$ Yang-Mills theory. By virtue of its classical integrability, this model also admits a family of integrable higher-spin auxiliary field deformations, including the $T \overline{T}$ deformation as a special case. We study the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model and its deformations from a geometrical perspective, constructing their soliton surfaces and recasting physical properties of these theories as statements about surface geometry. We examine how the $T \overline{T}$ flow affects the unit constraint in the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model and prove that any solution of this theory with vanishing energy-momentum tensor remains a solution under analytic stress tensor deformations -- an argument that extends to generic dimensions and instanton-like solutions in stress tensor flows including the non-analytic, $2d$, root-$T \overline{T}$ case and classes of higher-spin, Smirnov-Zamolodchikov-type, deformations. Finally, we give two geometric interpretations for general $T \overline{T}$-like deformations of symmetric space sigma models, showing that such flows can be viewed as coupling the undeformed theory to a unit-determinant field-dependent metric, or using a particular choice of moving frame on the soliton surface.</description>

      <title>A Formal Derivation of the Thick Spray Model from the Enskog-Boltzmann System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a specific scaling that formally derives the Euler-Vlasov model for thick sprays which is widely adopted in engineering from the Boltzmann-Enskog model. Beyond validating the kinetic-fluid equations underlying this model, we also identify higher-order corrections of the viscous force (of the order of the volume of the dispersed phase), which is neglected due to the incorporation of the volume fraction (void) function. Our approach builds on the work [Laurent Desvillettes, Fran\c{c}ois Golse, and Valeria Ricci. A formal passage from a system of Boltzmann equations for mixtures towards a Vlasov-Euler system of compressible fluids. Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series, 35(1):158-173, Jan 2019.], who formally connected a system of coupled Boltzmann equations for binary mixtures to a Vlasov-Euler system for thin sprays.</description>

      <title>Saddle Point Configurations for Spherical Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate saddle point configurations in spherical ferromagnets with perpendicular anisotropy. These are modeled by a micromagnetic energy functional on the unit sphere that leads to the emergence of the so-called curvature induced Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. For this functional we establish the existence of two distinct types of saddle points with zero mapping degree. We use a parabolic flow approach inspired by the harmonic map heat flow where for certain highly symmetric initial conditions we can rule out finite and infinite time blowup. Hence, we obtain solutions of the underlying Euler--Lagrange equation in the long time limit. This is in contrast to harmonic maps between two-spheres, where every map is a local minimizer of the energy functional.</description>

      <title>A Gutzwiller trace formula for singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gutzwiller trace formula relates the asymptotic spacing of quantum-mechanical energy levels in the semiclassical limit to the dynamics of periodic classical particle trajectories. We generalize this result to the case of non-smooth potentials, for which there is partial reflection of energy from derivative discontinuities of the potential. It is the periodic trajectories of an associated branching dynamics that contribute to the trace asymptotics in this more general setting; we obtain a precise description of their contribution.</description>

      <title>Reshetnyak Majorisation and discrete upper curvature bounds for Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analogue to the Majorisation Theorem of Reshetnyak in the setting of Lorentzian length spaces with upper curvature bounds: given two future-directed timelike rectifiable curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with the same endpoints in a Lorentzian length space $X$, there exists a convex region in $\mathbb{L}^2(K)$ bounded by two future-directed causal curves $\bar \alpha$ and $\bar \beta$ with the same endpoints and a 1-anti-Lipschitz map from that region into $X$ such that $\bar \alpha$ and $\bar \beta$ are respectively mapped $\tau$-length-preservingly onto $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A special case of this theorem leads to an interesting characterisation of upper curvature bounds via four-point configurations which is truly suitable for a discrete setting.</description>

      <title>Review of Steiner formulas in Fractal Geometry via Support measures and Complex Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the theoretical framework that establishes a crucial bridge between the general Steiner-type formula of Hug, Last, and Weil and the theory of complex (fractal) dimensions of Lapidus et all. Two novel families of geometric functionals are introduced based on the support measures of the set itself as well as of its parallel sets, respectively. The associated scaling exponents provide new tools for extracting geometric information of the set, beyond its classical fractal dimensions while also encoding its outer Minkowski dimension. Furthermore the scaling exponents also directly connect to the complex dimensions of the set while preserving essential geometric information. The framework provides a fundamental link between measure-theoretic approaches and analytical methods in fractal geometry, offering new perspectives on both the geometric measure theory of singular sets and the complex analytic theory of fractal zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Geometry of wave damping on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy decay rates of damped waves on the torus depend on the behavior of the damping near the undamped region and on the geometry of the damped set. In this paper we refine these geometric considerations, by introducing the concept of order of a glancing undamped point, and estimating decay rates in terms of this order. The proof is based on generalizing an averaging argument due to Sun. We also show that damping sets which attain these improvements are generic among polygons and smooth curves.</description>

Abstract: We establish positive energy theorems for complete spin initial data sets with charge in dimensions $n \geq 4$, under a dominant energy condition and assuming the existence of at least one asymptotically flat end. Our results, formulated in the purely electric case, extend the classical theorems of Gibbons--Hull~\cite{GibbonsHull}, Gibbons--Hawking--Horowitz--Perry~\cite{GibbonsHawkingHorowitzPerry}, and Bartnik--Chru\'sciel~\cite{BartnikChrusciel}.</description>

      <title>A strong-weak duality for the 1d long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. In the critical regime, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$, this system realizes a family of nontrivial one-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), whose data vary continuously with $s$. For $s&gt;1$ the model has instead no phase transition at finite temperature, as in the short-range case. In the standard field-theoretic description, involving a generalized free field with quartic interactions, the critical model is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled in the vicinity of the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We introduce a dual formulation that becomes weakly coupled as $s \to 1$. Precisely at $s=1$, the dual description becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition of the two-dimensional free scalar. We present a detailed study of the dual model and demonstrate its effectiveness by computing perturbatively the CFT data near $s=1$, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in $1-s$, by two independent approaches: (i) standard renormalization of our dual field-theoretic description and (ii) the analytic conformal bootstrap. The two methods yield complete agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uhlmann's theorem is a fundamental result in quantum information theory that quantifies the optimal overlap between two bipartite pure states after applying local unitary operations (called Uhlmann transformations). We show that optimal Uhlmann transformations are rigid -- in other words, they must be unique up to some well-characterized degrees of freedom. This rigidity is also robust: Uhlmann transformations achieving near-optimal overlaps must be close to the unique optimal transformation (again, up to well-characterized degrees of freedom). We describe two applications of our robust rigidity theorem: (a) we obtain better interactive proofs for synthesizing Uhlmann transformations and (b) we obtain a simple, alternative proof of the Gowers-Hatami theorem on the stability of approximate representations of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Existence and Non-existence for Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a coagulation-fragmentation equation that describes the evolution of the macroscopic cluster size distribution induced by a microscopic dynamic of binary exchanges of masses between clusters. It models droplet formation, migration dynamics, and asset exchanges in various scientific and socio-economic contexts. It can also be viewed as a generalization of the continuous Smoluchowski equations. In this work, we show the existence and uniqueness of solutions for kernels with superlinear growth at infinity and singularity at the origin and show the non-existence of solutions for kernels with sufficiently rapid growth. The latter result is shown via the finite-time gelation and instantaneous gelation in the sense of moment blow-up.</description>

      <title>Flat connections at infinity on knot surgery manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on a closed 3-manifold is one of the most interesting, yet tractable examples of a QFT. On one hand, its non-perturbative structure is not yet fully understood; on the other, the mathematical structure turns out to be very rich. In this work we explore the new phenomenon of flat connections at infinity on various knot surgery manifolds. Such flat connections can be understood as asymptotic ends in the non-compact moduli space of flat $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections. We focus on the examples of $\pm 1/r$-surgeries on torus, twist and some double twist knot complements in $S^3$. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that flat connections at infinity are abundant even for simple low-crossing knot surgeries. We therefore believe that their presence would shed light on the resurgent nature of the path integral.</description>

      <title>Joyce structures from quadratic differentials on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known examples of Joyce structures on spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials, we consider the isomonodromic deformations of particular second-order linear ODEs with rational potential. We show the infinitesimal isomonodromic deformations are the kernel of a closed $2$-form arising from the intersection pairing of an algebraic curve defined by the potential. This observation enables us to construct Joyce structures on a class of moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere, and provides a new, geometric description of the hyper-K\"ahler structures of previously computed examples. We focus on the case of moduli of quadratic differentials with poles of odd orders, where we obtain a complex hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry. We also include an example corresponding to the moduli space of quadratic differentials with four simple poles, which is a version of the classical isomonodromy problem that leads to the Painlev\'{e} VI equation.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between n-state spin and vertex models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a correspondence among spin and vertex models with the same number of local states on the square lattice with toroidal boundary conditions. We argue that the partition functions of an arbitrary $n$-state spin model and of a certain specific $n$-state vertex model coincide for finite lattice sizes. The equivalent vertex model has $n^3$ non-null Boltzmann weights and their relationship with the edge weights of the spin model is explicitly presented. In particular, the Ising model in a magnetic field is mapped to an eight-vertex model whose weights configurations combine both even and odd number of incoming and outcoming arrows at a vertex. We have studied the Yang-Baxter algebra for such mixed eight-vertex model when the weights are invariant under arrows reversing. We find that while the Lax operator lie on the same elliptic curve of the even eight-vertex model the respective $\mathrm{R}$-matrix can not be presented in terms of the difference of two rapidities. We also argue that the spin-vertex equivalence may be used to imbed an integrable spin model in the realm of the quantum inverse scattering framework. As an example, we show how to determine the $\mathrm{R}$-matrix of the 27-vertex model equivalent to a three-state spin model devised by Fateev and Zamolodchikov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical relaxation in moir\'e materials is often modeled by a continuum model where linear elasticity is coupled to a stacking penalty known as the Generalized Stacking Fault Energy (GSFE). We review and compute minimizers of a one-dimensional version of this model, and then show how it can be formally derived from a natural atomistic model. Specifically, we show that the continuum model emerges in the limit $\epsilon \downarrow 0$ and $\delta \downarrow 0$ while holding the ratio $\eta := \frac{\epsilon^2}{\delta}$ fixed, where $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the monolayer lattice constant to the moir\'e lattice constant and $\delta$ is the ratio of the typical stacking energy to the monolayer stiffness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to show that, mathematically, screw dislocation loops with distinct topological properties can be introduced locally on a given smectic liquid crystal configuration. Concretely, given a configuration, we show that a new screw dislocation loop can be introduced along any knot or link transverse to the regular layers through a purely local modification. We define a topological invariant of screw dislocation loops, the multiplicity, and show that it can be explicitly prescribed in our construction. Finally, we apply this method to establish that any link type can be locally introduced within the set of screw dislocations of smectic configurations of a certain class. This shows that both the global topology (link type) and the local topology (multiplicity) of loop dislocations can be very rich, even when constrained to arise from local modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an 't Hooft anomaly index for a group acting on a 2d quantum lattice system by finite-depth circuits. It takes values in the degree-4 cohomology of the group and is an obstruction to on-siteability of the group action. We introduce a 3-group (modeled as a crossed square) describing higher symmetries of a 2d lattice system and show that the 2d anomaly index is an obstruction for promoting a symmetry action to a morphism of 3-groups. This demonstrates that 't Hooft anomalies are a consequence of a mixing between ordinary symmetries and higher symmetries. Similarly, to any 1d lattice system we attach a 2-group (modeled as a crossed module) and interpret the Nayak-Else anomaly index as an obstruction for promoting a group action to a morphism of 2-groups. The meaning of indices of Symmetry Protected Topological states is also illuminated by higher group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Finite size corrections in the bulk for circular $\beta$ ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circular $\beta$ ensemble for $\beta =1,2$ and 4 corresponds to circular orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensemble respectively as introduced by Dyson. The statistical state of the eigenvalues is then a determinantal point process ($\beta = 2$) and Pfaffian point process ($\beta = 1,4$). The explicit functional forms of the correlation kernels then imply that the general $n$-point correlation functions exhibit an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$, which moreover can be lifted to an asymptotic in $1/N^2$ for the spacing distributions and their generating function. We use $\sigma$-Painlev\'e characterisations to show that the functional form of the first correction is related to the leading term via a second derivative. In the case $\beta = 2$ this finding has immediate consequence in interpreting the empirical Riemann zeros spacing distribution at large height, and that of their thinning. Explicit functional forms are used to show that the spectral form factors for $\beta =1,2$ and 4 also admit an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$. Differential relations are identified expressing the first and second correction in terms of the limiting functional form, and evidence is presented that they hold for general $\beta$. For even $\beta$ it is proved that the two-point correlation function permits an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$, and moreover that the leading correction relates to the limiting functional form via a second derivative.</description>

      <title>Wave pulses with unusual asymptotical behavior at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18292</link>

Abstract: The behavior of wave signals in the far zone is not only of theoretical interest but also of paramount practical importance in communications and other fields of applications of optical, electromagnetic or acoustic waves. Long time ago T. T. Wu introduced models of 'electromagnetic missiles' whose decay could be made arbitrarily slower than the usual inverse distance by an appropriate choice of the high frequency portion of the source spectrum. Very recent work by Plachenov and Kiselev introduced a finite-energy scalar wave solution, different from Wu's, decaying slower than inversely proportional with the distance. A physical explanation for the unusual asymptotic behavior of the latter will be given in this article. Furthermore, two additional examples of scalar wave pulses characterized by abnormal slow decay in the far zone will be given and their asymptotic behavior will be discussed. A proof of feasibility of acoustic and electromagnetic fields with the abnormal asymptotics will be described.</description>

      <title>Rigid models for 2-gerbes I: Chern-Simons geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of constructing explicit geometric string structures, we give a rigid model for bundle 2-gerbes, and define connective structures thereon. This model is designed to make explicit calculations easier in applications to physics. To compare to the existing definition, we give a functorial construction of a bundle 2-gerbe as in the literature from our rigid model, including with connections. As an example we prove that the Chern--Simons bundle 2-gerbe from the literature, with its connective structure, can be rigidified -- it arises, up to isomorphism in the strongest possible sense, from a rigid bundle 2-gerbe with connective structure via this construction. Further, our rigid version of 2-gerbe trivialisation (with connections) gives rise to trivialisations (with connections) of bundle 2-gerbes in the usual sense, and as such can be used to describe geometric string structures.</description>

      <title>The coisotropic embedding theorem for pre-symplectic manifolds: an alternative proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative proof of the Coisotropic Embedding Theorem in which the geometric choice of a connection is recast as the algebraic choice of an embedding into the cotangent bundle. The symplectic thickening is then identified as the submanifold determined by the Hamiltonian momenta conjugate to the kernel directions of the pre-symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into a generic static black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nontrivial extension of the problem of spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into the standard Schwarzschild black hole. This extension consists of replacing the Schwarzschild black hole by generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes with the aim of studying the effects of either modified gravitational theories beyond Einstein gravity or matter sources coupled to general relativity on the accretion process. This generalization also allows us to investigate the accretion into other types of black hole spacetimes, such as ones inspired by loop quantum gravity and string theory. To do so, we take into account a large class of static and spherically symmetric black holes whose spacetime is asymptotically flat with a positive total mass, has a regular Killing horizon, and satisfies appropriate monotonicity conditions of the metric functions. We provide the most general solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation on such spacetimes by expressing the one-particle distribution function in terms of suitable symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and we calculate the relevant observables, such as particle current density and energy-momentum-stress tensor. Specializing to the case where the gas is described by an isotropic ideal fluid at rest at infinity, we compute the mass accretion rate and compression ratio, and we show that the tangential pressure is larger than the radial one at the horizon, indicating that the behavior of a collisionless gas is different from the one of an isotropic perfect fluid. As an example, we apply our generic formulae to two special black hole spacetimes, namely the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and a loop quantum corrected black hole. We explore the effects of the free parameters on the observables and accretion rate, and we compare the results with those corresponding to the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for non-Hermitian Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the modulus of the extreme eigenvalues is investigated for the complex Ginibre and complex induced Ginibre ensembles in the limit of large dimensions of random matrices. The limiting distribution of the scaled spectral radius and the scaled minimum modulus for the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, with a proportional rectangularity index, is the Gumbel distribution. The independence of these extrema is established, at appropriate scaling, for large matrices from the complex Ginibre ensemble as well as from the complex induced Ginibre ensemble for either fixed or proportional rectangularity indexes. The joint distribution of the eigenvalue moduli for the complex Ginibre ensemble is derived in this paper. It is equal to the joint distribution of independent random variables, each following a Gamma-Rayleigh distribution. In the limit of a large size of the complex Ginibre matrices, the left and right tail distributions of the minimum modulus are the Rayleigh and Weibull distributions, respectively. The limiting left tail distribution of minimum modulus is the same for these non-Hermitian ensembles when the rectangularity index of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble is equal to zero. This phenomenon is also verified for the right tail distribution of this minimum.</description>

      <title>Identification of gapless phases by a twisting operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of a twisting operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system under the action of a unitary matrix, in the limit where that matrix is close to the unit matrix. The physical context for such process would be scattering with weak short-ranged interactions where the unitary matrix is the S matrix. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the S matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of initial states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

      <title>KPZ equation from a class of nonlinear SPDEs in infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite volume. We show that under a weakly asymmetric scaling, their solutions converge to that of the KPZ equation. The result holds for a large class of potentials, nonlinearities, and essentially any (non-equilibrium) initial data for the limit KPZ equation. The main technical innovation is the analysis of a stochastic heat kernel for the SPDE of interest.</description>

      <title>Defect Networks for Topological Phases Protected By Modulated Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries which do not commute with spatial symmetries; dipolar symmetries are a prime example. We give a general recipe for constructing topological phases protected by modulated symmetries via a defect network construction, generalizing the crystalline equivalence principle to modulated symmetries. We demonstrate that modulated symmetries can be treated identically to unmodulated symmetries in the absence of spatial symmetries, but in the presence of spatial symmetries, some defect networks which are non-anomalous for unmodulated symmetries become anomalous for modulated symmetries. We apply this understanding to classify symmetry-protected topological phases protected by translation symmetry plus either discrete or continuous dipolar symmetries in (1+1)D and (2+1)D and obtain a number of other (1+1)D classification results for modulated symmetry-protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Elastoplasticity with softening as a state-dependent sweeping process: non-uniqueness of solutions and emergence of shear bands in lattices of springs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasticity with softening and fracture mechanics lead to ill-posed mathematical problems due to the loss of monotonicity. Multiple co-existing solutions are possible when softening elements are coupled together, and solutions cannot be continued beyond the point of complete degradation of the set of admissible stresses. We present a state-dependent sweeping process which solves the evolution of elasto-plastic Lattice Spring Models with arbitrary placement of softening, hardening and perfectly plastic springs. Using numerical simulations of regular grid lattices with softening we demonstrate the emergence of non-symmetric shear bands with strain localization. At the same time, in toy examples it is easy to analytically derive multiple co-existing solutions. These solutions correspond to fixed points in the implicit catch-up algorithm and we observe a discontinuous bifurcation with the exchange of stability of those fixed points.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>Is There an Exact Magnetic-Moment for Charged Particle Motion in a Homogeneous, Time-Dependent Magnetic Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonperturbative guiding-center model provides an exact alternative to full-orbit simulations of charged particle dynamics in situations where traditional guiding-center theory may fail. We demonstrate that the charged particle motion in a homogeneous, time-varying magnetic field is a solvable example of the nonperturbative guiding-center model. This entails showing that the exact magnetic moment of Qin and Davidson can be constructed to be asymptotic to the adiabatic invariant series of Kruskal. In contrast to the perturbative invariant, the exact invariant contains information about parametric resonances. These resonances destroy the conservation of the usual magnetic moment over very long times. This refutes some previous claims about the all-time invariance of the magnetic moment.</description>
