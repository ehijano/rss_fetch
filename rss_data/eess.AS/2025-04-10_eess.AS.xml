      <title>RNN-Transducer-based Losses for Speech Recognition on Noisy Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training speech recognition systems on noisy transcripts is a significant challenge in industrial pipelines, where datasets are enormous and ensuring accurate transcription for every instance is difficult. In this work, we introduce novel loss functions to mitigate the impact of transcription errors in RNN-Transducer models. Our Star-Transducer loss addresses deletion errors by incorporating "skip frame" transitions in the loss lattice, restoring over 90% of the system's performance compared to models trained with accurate transcripts. The Bypass-Transducer loss uses "skip token" transitions to tackle insertion errors, recovering more than 60% of the quality. Finally, the Target-Robust Transducer loss merges these approaches, offering robust performance against arbitrary errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the Target-Robust Transducer loss significantly improves RNN-T performance on noisy data by restoring over 70% of the quality compared to well-transcribed data.</description>

      <title>A Cascaded Architecture for Extractive Summarization of Multimedia Content via Audio-to-Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a cascaded architecture for extractive summarization of multimedia content via audio-to-text alignment. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of extracting key insights from multimedia sources like YouTube videos. It integrates audio-to-text conversion using Microsoft Azure Speech with advanced extractive summarization models, including Whisper, Pegasus, and Facebook BART XSum. The system employs tools such as Pytube, Pydub, and SpeechRecognition for content retrieval, audio extraction, and transcription. Linguistic analysis is enhanced through named entity recognition and semantic role labeling. Evaluation using ROUGE and F1 scores demonstrates that the cascaded architecture outperforms conventional summarization methods, despite challenges like transcription errors. Future improvements may include model fine-tuning and real-time processing. This study contributes to multimedia summarization by improving information retrieval, accessibility, and user experience.</description>

      <title>Controllable Automatic Foley Artist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foley is a key element in video production, refers to the process of adding an audio signal to a silent video while ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. In recent years, the rise of personalized content creation and advancements in automatic video-to-audio models have increased the demand for greater user control in the process. One possible approach is to incorporate text to guide audio generation. While supported by existing methods, challenges remain in ensuring compatibility between modalities, particularly when the text introduces additional information or contradicts the sounds naturally inferred from the visuals. In this work, we introduce CAFA (Controllable Automatic Foley Artist) a video-and-text-to-audio model that generates semantically and temporally aligned audio for a given video, guided by text input. CAFA is built upon a text-to-audio model and integrates video information through a modality adapter mechanism. By incorporating text, users can refine semantic details and introduce creative variations, guiding the audio synthesis beyond the expected video contextual cues. Experiments show that besides its superior quality in terms of semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization the proposed method enable high textual controllability as demonstrated in subjective and objective evaluations.</description>

      <title>TASTE: Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding for Spoken Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text-based natural language processing tasks but remain constrained by their reliance on textual inputs and outputs. To enable more natural human-LLM interaction, recent progress have focused on deriving a spoken language model (SLM) that can not only listen but also generate speech. To achieve this, a promising direction is to conduct speech-text joint modeling. However, recent SLM still lag behind text LLM due to the modality mismatch. One significant mismatch can be the sequence lengths between speech and text tokens. To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a method that can achieve this through the special aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. Furthermore, by leveraging TASTE, we can adapt text-based LLMs into effective SLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Experimental results on benchmark tasks, including SALMON and StoryCloze, demonstrate that TASTE-based SLMs perform similarly to previous full-finetuning methods. To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling. Our demo, code, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mtkresearch/TASTE-SpokenLM.</description>

      <title>A Simple but Strong Baseline for Sounding Video Generation: Effective Adaptation of Audio and Video Diffusion Models for Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we build a simple but strong baseline for sounding video generation. Given base diffusion models for audio and video, we integrate them with additional modules into a single model and train it to make the model jointly generate audio and video. To enhance alignment between audio-video pairs, we introduce two novel mechanisms in our model. The first one is timestep adjustment, which provides different timestep information to each base model. It is designed to align how samples are generated along with timesteps across modalities. The second one is a new design of the additional modules, termed Cross-Modal Conditioning as Positional Encoding (CMC-PE). In CMC-PE, cross-modal information is embedded as if it represents temporal position information, and the embeddings are fed into the model like positional encoding. Compared with the popular cross-attention mechanism, CMC-PE provides a better inductive bias for temporal alignment in the generated data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the two newly introduced mechanisms and also demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>F5R-TTS: Improving Flow-Matching based Text-to-Speech with Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present F5R-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system that integrates Gradient Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) into a flow-matching based architecture. By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (a 29.5% relative reduction in WER) and speaker similarity (a 4.6% relative increase in SIM score) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems.

      <title>STAGE: Stemmed Accompaniment Generation through Prefix-Based Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have made it possible to create high-quality, coherent music, with some systems delivering production-level output. Yet, most existing models focus solely on generating music from scratch, limiting their usefulness for musicians who want to integrate such models into a human, iterative composition workflow. In this paper we introduce STAGE, our STemmed Accompaniment GEneration model, fine-tuned from the state-of-the-art MusicGen to generate single-stem instrumental accompaniments conditioned on a given mixture. Inspired by instruction-tuning methods for language models, we extend the transformer's embedding matrix with a context token, enabling the model to attend to a musical context through prefix-based conditioning. Compared to the baselines, STAGE yields accompaniments that exhibit stronger coherence with the input mixture, higher audio quality, and closer alignment with textual prompts. Moreover, by conditioning on a metronome-like track, our framework naturally supports tempo-constrained generation, achieving state-of-the-art alignment with the target rhythmic structure--all without requiring any additional tempo-specific module. As a result, STAGE offers a practical, versatile tool for interactive music creation that can be readily adopted by musicians in real-world workflows.</description>
