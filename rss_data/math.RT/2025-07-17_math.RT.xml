      <title>Classical interpolation categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tensor categories that interpolate the representation categories of finite classical groups. There are (at least) two ways to approach these categories: via ultraproducts and via oligomorphic groups. Both have strengths and weaknesses. The ultraproduct categories are easy to define, but their structure is not clear. On the other hand, the oligomorphic approach requires a certain kind of measure as an input, and the space of measures is not obvious. Furthermore, it is not a priori clear that the two approaches yield the same categories in general. We handle all of these issues: we determine all measures on the oligomorphic groups, and we show that the oligomorphic and ultraproduct categories agree, which gives us basic structural results about the latter. Our results rely upon (and in some sense repackage) enumerative results in finite geometry.</description>

      <title>Base change of (Gorenstein) transpose, k-torsionfree modules, and quasi-faithfully flat extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi\colon R \rightarrow A$ be a finite ring homomorphism, where $R$ is a two-sided Noetherian ring, and let $M$ be a finitely generated left $A$-module. Under suitable homological conditions on $A$ over $R$, we establish a close relationship between the classical transpose of $M$ over $A$ and the Gorenstein transpose of a certain syzygy module of $M$ over $R$. As an application, for each integer $k&gt;0$, we provide a sufficient condition under which $M$ is $k$-torsionfree over $A$ if and only if a certain syzygy of $M$ over $R$ is $k$-torsionfree over $R$, extending a result of Zhao. We introduce the notion of quasi-faithfully flat extensions and show that, under suitable assumptions, the extension closedness of the category of $k$-torsionfree modules over $R$ is equivalent to that over $A$. An application is an affirmative answer to a question posed by Zhao concerning quasi $k$-Gorensteiness, in the case where both $R$ and $A$ are Noetherian algebras. Finally, when $\varphi$ is a separable split Frobenius extension, it is proved that the category of $k$-torsionfree $R$-modules has finite representation type if and only if the same holds over $A$, with applications to skew group rings.</description>

      <title>Depth one part of Tannakian groups of filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(F_r M)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$ be a finite filtration on an object $M$ of a neutral Tannakian category $\mathbf{T}$ in characteristic zero. Let $u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental group of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The filtration $F_\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom $\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\bullet u(M)$ on $u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this paper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of the extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In particular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we neither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is semisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by the desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its realizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations of pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting functorial weight filtration.
  We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition in the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial upper bound $F_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier criteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special contexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the results to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight filtration $W_\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with our general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the set of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a given graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.</description>

      <title>The disoriented skein and iquantum Brauer categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a diagrammatic approach to the representation theory of the quantum symmetric pairs corresponding to orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras inside general linear Lie superalgebras. Our approach is based on the disoriented skein category, which we define as a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category admits full incarnation functors to the categories of modules over the iquantum enveloping algebras corresponding to the quantum symmetric pairs, and it can be viewed as an interpolating category for these categories of modules. We define an equivalence of module categories between the disoriented skein category and the iquantum Brauer category (also known as the $q$-Brauer category), after endowing the latter with the structure of a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category has some advantages over the iquantum Brauer category, possessing duality structure and allowing the incarnation functors to be strict morphisms of module categories. Finally, we construct explicit bases for the morphism spaces of the disoriented skein and iquantum Brauer categories.</description>

      <title>Cohomology rings of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk I give an introduction and present some recent progress towards understanding the cohomology rings of character varieties of Riemann surfaces, such as the proof of the $P=W$ conjecture and the computation of the zero-dimensional COHA. In the case of punctured sphere I present an explicit description relating the cohomology rings to the Hilbert scheme of $\mathbb{C}^2$, refining conjectures of Hausel-Letellier-Rodriguez-Villegas and Chuang-Diaconescu-Donagi-Pantev. I explain how the general case should be related to the symplectic geometry of the Hilbert scheme.</description>

      <title>Foams, iterated wreath products, field extensions and Sylvester sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain foams and relations on them are introduced to interpret functors and natural transformations in categories of representations of iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order two. We also explain how patched surfaces with defect circles and foams relate to separable field extensions and Galois theory and explore a relation between overlapping foams and Sylvester double sums. In the appendix, joint with Lev Rozansky, we compare traces in two-dimensional TQFTs coming from matrix factorizations with those in field extensions.</description>

      <title>Modulus of continuity of Kerov transition measure for continual Young diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</description>
