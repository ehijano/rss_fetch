      <title>Non-uniform wave momentum bandgap in biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) host momentum bandgaps enabling intriguing non-resonant light amplification in propagating waves, but opening substantial bandgaps demands refractive index changes too extreme for conventional nonlinear optics. Here, we introduce momentum bandgaps for non-uniform waves, including evanescent and ghost types, by extending PTCs to biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals that periodically alternate between uniform biaxial anisotropy and isotropic media over time. We show that ghost waves, unlike evanescent waves, sustain only momentum bandgaps, opening wide bandgaps at even the smallest modulation depths. Moreover, we demonstrate momentum bandgap effects on non-uniform waves that can be amplified, or through decaying modes, selectively attenuated. We find that ghost wave momentum bandgaps uniquely boost refracted over reflected waves under one-way incidence, in stark contrast to balanced amplification seen in both propagating and evanescent waves. Our approach expands time-varying metamaterials by integrating wave characteristics, bridging the gap between conventional nonlinear optics and PTC momentum bandgaps, and shedding new light on extreme manipulation of surface polaritons.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Polariton Lasing from CdSe core-only Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports how CdSe core-only nanoplatelets coupled with plasmonic Al nanoparticle lattices can exhibit exciton-polariton lasing. By improving a procedure to synthesize monodisperse 4-monolayer CdSe nanoplatelets, we could resolve polariton decay dynamics and pathways. Experiment and theory confirmed that the system is in the strong coupling regime based on anti-crossings in the dispersion diagrams and magnitude of the Rabi splitting values. Notably, polariton lasing is observed only for cavity lattice periodicities that exhibit specific dispersive characteristics that enable polariton accumulation. The threshold of polariton lasing is 25-fold lower than reported photon lasing values from CdSe nanoplatelets in similar cavity designs. This open-cavity platform offers a simple approach to control exciton polaritons anticipated to benefit quantum information processing, optoelectronics, and chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>An ultra-broadband photonic-chip-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) to enhance signals without distortion. However, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibers. Optical parametric amplification, utilizing material nonlinearities, offers expanded capacity, but has faced limitations in gain and bandwidth. Addressing this, we present a high-gain continuous-traveling-wave parametric amplifier, surpassing the erbium gain window. Leveraging low-loss gallium phosphide-on-insulator photonic integrated waveguides, we achieve up to 35 dB of parametric gain, with a fiber-to-fiber net gain exceeding 10 dB across a wide wavelength range of approximately 140 nm centered at 1550 nm. We demonstrate the capability to amplify ultra-weak signals, extending over 6 orders of magnitude of input powers, optical frequency combs, and communication signals, highlighting the practical potential of our photonic-chip-based amplifier.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical second-order sidebands and group delays in a spinning resonator with parametric amplifier and non-Markovian effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the frequency components at the second-order sidebands based on a spinning resonator containing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We show an OPA driven by different pumping frequencies inside a cavity can enhance and modulate the amplitude of the second-order sideband with different influences. We find that both the second-order sideband amplitude and its associated group delay sensitively depend on the nonlinear gain of the OPA, the phase of the field driving the OPA, the rotation speed of the resonator, and the incident direction of the input fields. Tuning the pumping frequency of the OPA can remain the localization of the maximum value of the sideband efficiency and nonreciprocal behavior due to the optical Sagnac effect, which also can adjust the linewidth of the suppressive window of the second-order sideband. Furthermore, we extend the study of second-order sideband to the non-Markovian bath which consists of a collection of infinite oscillators (bosonic photonic modes). We illustrate the second-order sidebands in a spinning resonator exhibit a transition from the non-Markovian to Markovian regime by controlling environmental spectral width. \textbf{We also study the influences of the decay from the non-Markovian environment coupling to an external reservoir on the efficiency of second-order upper sidebands.} This indicates a promising new way to enhance or steer optomechanically induced transparency devices in nonlinear optical cavities and provides potential applications for precision measurement, optical communications, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic effect from an oscillating source in a one-dimensional resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the photoacoustic effect is most commonly generated by pulsed or amplitude modulated continuous optical sources, it is possible to generate acoustic waves by moving a constant amplitude, continuous light beam. If the light beam moves at the speed of sound, an amplification effect takes place which can be used in trace gas detection. Here, the properties of the photoacoustic effect are investigated for a continuous optical beam moving in a one-dimensional resonator. The solution shows the additive effects of sweeping the optical beam the length of the cell and back.</description>

      <title>On-chip quantum interference between independent lithium niobate-on-insulator photon-pair sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating and interfering non-classical states of light is fundamental to optical quantum information science and technology. Quantum photonic integrated circuits provide one pathway towards scalability by combining nonlinear sources of non-classical light and programmable circuits in centimeter-scale devices. The key requirements for quantum applications include efficient generation of indistinguishable photon-pairs and high-visibility programmable quantum interference. Here, we demonstrate a lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) integrated photonic circuit that generates a two-photon path-entangled state, and a programmable interferometer for quantum interference. We generate entangled photons with $\sim2.3\times10^8$ pairs/s/mW brightness and perform quantum interference experiments on the chip with $96.8\pm3.6\%$ visibility. LNOI is an emerging photonics technology that has revolutionized high-speed modulators and efficient frequency conversion. Our results provide a path towards large-scale integrated quantum photonics including efficient photon-pair generation and programmable circuits for applications such as boson sampling and quantum communications.</description>
