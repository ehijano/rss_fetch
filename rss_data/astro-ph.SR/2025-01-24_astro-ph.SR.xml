      <title>Global Turbulent Solar Convection: a Numerical Path Investigating Key Force Balances in the context of the Convective Conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding solar turbulent convection and its influence on differential rotation has been a challenge over the past two decades. Current models often overestimate giant convection cells amplitude, leading to an effective Rossby number too large and a shift towards an anti-solar rotation regime. This Convective Conundrum, underscores the need for improved comprehension of solar convective dynamics. We propose a numerical experiment in the parameter space that controls $Ro$ while increasing the Reynolds number ($Re$) and maintaining solar parameters. By controlling the Nusselt number ($Nu$), we limit the energy transport by convection while reducing viscous dissipation. This approach enabled us to construct a Sun-like rotating model (SBR97n035) with strong turbulence ($Re \sim 800$) that exhibits prograde equatorial rotation and aligns with observational data from helioseismology. We compare this model with an anti-solar rotating counterpart, and provide an in-depth spectral analysis to investigate the changes in convective dynamics. We also find the appearance of vorticity rings near the poles, which existence on the Sun could be probed in the future. The Sun-like model shows reduced buoyancy over the spectrum, as well as an extended quasi-geostrophic equilibrium towards smaller scales. This promotes a Coriolis-Inertia (CI) balance rather than a Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedes (CIA) balance, in order to favor the establishment of a prograde equator. The presence of convective columns in the bulk of the convection zone, with limited surface manifestations, also hints at such structures potentially occurring in the Sun.</description>

      <title>Beyond MESA Defaults: The Impact of Structural Resolution Uncertainty in p-mode Asteroseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of pressure modes ($p$-modes) in stars have enabled profound insights into stellar properties, and theoretical stellar evolution and oscillation models are integral to these inferences. However, modeling uncertainties are often overlooked, even as they can rival or exceed observational uncertainties. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the impact of structural resolution choices in 1D stellar evolution calculations on predicted $p$-mode frequencies across the HR diagram, using \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{GYRE}. We present measurements of resolution-based modeling uncertainty for a range of solar-like, upper main-sequence, and Mira oscillators and compare these directly to TESS observational uncertainties. We demonstrate that resolution-driven uncertainties can significantly influence theoretical predictions and in some cases overwhelm observational uncertainties by orders of magnitude: while solar-like oscillators typically have fractional, resolution-based uncertainties at or below 1\% of the test frequency, fractional uncertainties in Miras were as large as 20\%. We also find that the location and morphology of the RGB bump and red clump are impacted substantially by resolution uncertainty. Stellar ages are impacted at the 10\% level for young main-sequence stars, and the model-based correction factor for the $\Delta\nu$--$\sqrt{\rho}$ scaling relation is impacted at the 2\% level. Our results underscore the need to incorporate modeling uncertainties into asteroseismic analyses and provide a reference framework for observers evaluating the reliability of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Magnetic Field Characteristics into EUV-Based Automated Segmentation of Coronal Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal holes (CH) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the boundary which identifies the CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while simultaneously allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to the aforementioned inconsistent intensities.</description>

      <title>The neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.</description>

      <title>Unstable accretion in TW Hya: 3D simulations and comparisons with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of photometric variability in the classical T Tauri star TW Hya by comparing light curves obtained by TESS and ground-based telescopes with light curves created using three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. TW Hya is modeled as a rotating star with a dipole magnetic moment, slightly tilted about the rotational axis. We observed that for various model parameters, matter accretes in the unstable regime and produces multiple hot spots on the star's surface, which leads to stochastic-looking light curves similar to the observed ones. Wavelet and Fourier spectra of observed and modeled light curves show multiple quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with quasiperiods from less than 0.1 to 9 days. Models show that variation in the strength and tilt of the dipole magnetosphere leads to different periodograms, where the period of the star may dominate or be hidden. The amplitude of QPOs associated with the stellar period can be smaller than that of other QPOs if the tilt of the dipole magnetosphere is small and when the unstable regime is stronger. In models with small magnetospheres, the short-period QPOs associated with rotation of the inner disc dominate and can be mistaken for a stellar period. We show that longer-period (5-9 days) QPOs can be caused by waves forming beyond the corotation radius.</description>

      <title>A search for close binary systems in the SALT survey of hydrogen-deficient stars using {\it TESS}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\it TESS} periodograms of the SALT survey catalogue of hydrogen-deficient stars were searched for evidence of short-period variability. Periodic light curve variations were identified in 16 stars out of 153 catalogue objects, of which 10 were false positives. From the remaining 6 identified variables, Ton S 415 is a known close binary system and the sixth close binary containing a hydrogen-deficient hot subdwarf. Radial velocity and SED analyses ruled out the remaining 5 as close binary systems; the causes of their variability remain uncertain. With one or more K-type companions, BPS CS 22956-0094 may be a wide binary or triple. From this SALT+{\it TESS} sample, the fraction of close binaries stands at $ 1/29 \approx 3.5\%$ for intermediate helium hot subdwarfs and $0/124 = 0\%$ for extreme helium subdwarfs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the richest pulsating ultra-massive white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of pulsations in ultra-massive white dwarfs can help to probe their interiors and unveil their core composition and crystallized mass fraction through asteroseismic techniques. To date, the richest pulsating ultra-massive white dwarf known is BPM 37093 with 8 modes detected, for which detailed asteroseismic analysis has been performed in the past. In this work, we report the discovery of 19 pulsation modes in the ultra-massive white dwarf star WD~J0135+5722, making it the richest pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere ultramassive white dwarf known to date. %In this work, we report the discovery of pulsations in WD~J0135+5722, a hydrogen-rich ultra-massive white dwarf observed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. This object exhibits multi-periodic luminosity variations with periods ranging from 137 to 1345 s, typical of pulsating white dwarfs in the ZZ Ceti instability strip, which is centered at $T_{\rm eff} \sim 12\,000$ K. We estimate the stellar mass of WD J0135+5722 by different methods, resulting in $M_{\star} \sim 1.12-1.14 M_{\odot}$ if the star's core is made of oxygen and neon, or $M_{\star} \sim 1.14-1.15 M_{\odot}$ if the star hosts a carbon oxygen core. Future analysis of the star periods could shed light on the core chemical composition through asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Poynting flux of Alfv\'enic waves in polar coronal holes across Solar Cycle 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic waves are known to be prevalent throughout the corona and solar wind. Determining the Poynting flux supplied by the waves is required for constraining their role in plasma heating and acceleration, as well as providing a constraint for Alfv\'en wave driven models that aim to predict coronal and solar wind properties. Previous studies of the Alfv\'enic waves in polar coronal holes have been able to provide a measure of energy flux for arbitrary case studies. Here we build upon previous work and take a more systematic approach, examining if there is evidence for any variation in vertical Poynting flux over the course of the solar cycle. We use imaging data from SDO/AIA to measure the displacements of the fine-scale structure present in coronal holes. It is found that the measure for vertical Poynting flux is broadly similar over the solar cycle, implying a consistent contribution from waves to the energy budget of the solar wind. There is variation in energy flux across the measurements (around 30\%), but this is suggested to be due to differences in the individual coronal holes rather than a feature of the solar cycle. Our direct estimates are in agreement with recent studies by \cite{Huang_2023,Huang2024} who constrain the vertical Poynting flux through comparison of predicted wind properties from Alfv\'enic wave driven turbulence models to those observed with OMNI at 1~AU. Taken together, both sets of results points towards a lack of correlation between the coronal Poynting flux from waves and the solar cycle.</description>

      <title>Testing tidal theory using Gaia binaries: the red giant branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interaction is a major ingredient in the theory of binary evolution. Here, we study tidal circularization in binaries with red giant primaries. We compute the tidal evolution for binaries as their primary stars evolve along the red giant branch, under dissipation of dynamical tides in the convective envelope. We then compare this evolution with a sample of $\sim30,000$ red giant binaries reported by Gaia DR3. These binaries clearly show the expected gradual advance of tidal circularization, as the primary expands. But some tension with theory remains. While our calculations always predict a critical separation for tidal circularization at about $3-4$ times the stellar radii, binaries with less evolved giants are observed to be circularized out to about twice as far. They also exhibit an overly extended `cool island', a collection of circular orbits that reach a couple times beyond the circularization limit. These discrepancies are reminiscent of, but less severe than, the situation for main-sequence binaries. We also find that tides can spin giant stars up to rotation rates that should affect their mass-loss. Additionally, many binaries may begin mass transfer while still eccentric.</description>

      <title>Two decades of optical variability of Small Magellanic Cloud high-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the long-term optical/IR behavior of 111 high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud based on data from the OGLE collaboration. Most systems exhibit variability on a range of time scales. This variability regulates the mass transfer to the compact object, while the compact object can, in turn, affect the donor star's behavior. To better understand this complex interaction and the resulting X-ray properties in these systems, we define a new taxonomy for the observed super-orbital variability. This taxonomy connects to the color changes, orbital periods, and X-ray behavior of the sources. In most cases, these properties can be explained by differences between the flux of the disk around the Be star and the flux from the star itself. We also refine and present new potential orbital periods and sub-orbital variability in the sources.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Radiation Transport Simulations of Infrared Echoes from Dust-Shrouded Luminous Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of stellar explosions, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption events (TDE), and fast blue optical transients (FBOT), can occur in dusty environments initially opaque to the transient's optical/UV light, becoming visible only once the dust is destroyed by the transient's rising luminosity. We present axisymmetric time-dependent radiation transport simulations of dust-shrouded transients with \texttt{Athena++} and tabulated gray opacities, which predict the light-curves of the dust-reprocessed infrared (IR) radiation. The luminosity and timescale of the IR light-curve depends on whether the transient rises rapidly or slowly compared to the light crossing-time of the photosphere, $t_{\rm lc}$. For slow-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \gg t_{\rm lc}$) such as SNe, the reprocessed IR radiation diffuses outwards through the dust shell faster than the sublimation front expands; the IR light-curve therefore begins rising prior to the escape of UV/optical light, but peaks on a timescale $\sim t_{\rm rise}$ shorter than the transient duration. By contrast, for fast-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \ll t_{\rm lc}$) such as FBOTs and some TDEs, the finite light-travel time results in the reprocessed radiation arriving as an ``echo'' lasting much longer than the transient itself (despite the dust photosphere having already being destroyed by peak light). We explore the effects of the system geometry by considering a torus-shaped distribution of dust. The IR light-curves seen by observers in the equatorial plane of the torus resemble those for a spherical dust shell, while polar observers see faster-rising, brighter and shorter-lived emission. We successfully model the IR excess seen in AT2018cow as a dust echo, supporting the presence of an opaque dusty medium surrounding FBOTs prior to explosion.</description>

      <title>Properties of Free Floating Planets Ejected through Planet-Planet Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple studies have shown that planet-planet scattering plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. For instance, it has been shown that planet-planet scattering can reproduce the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets. It can also contribute to the current census of free floating planets. In this work we run an ensemble of N-body simulations of planetary systems, and record the properties of planets which are ejected from the system. In our simulations we sample a wide range of orbital and physical properties of the planets. We find that in general $40-80\%$ of the planets are ejected from the system depending on the number of planets initially in the system. Most of the planets are ejected over a timescale of $\sim 10^8-10^9$ years. The ejected planets have a mean excess velocity in the range of 2-6 km/sec with respect to the host star. The excess velocities of the planets ejected from the system strongly depends on the semi-major axis of the inner most planet. We find that irrespective of their initial location in the planetary system, all planets are equally likely to be ejected from the system. Also, bound and ejected planets have distinct mass distributions, with bound planets being more massive than ejected planets. In addition, increasing the radii of the planets reduces the ejection fraction. The properties of the ejected planets do not strongly depend on the initial spacing between the planets. The timescale over which ejections happen does increase with the initial separation between the planets. We also find that the ejection fraction does not strongly depend on the distance from the host star beyond which the planets are considered unbound. Finally, we compared our results with observed populations of free floating planets. We conclude that on average 5-10 planets should form around each star to reproduce the observations.</description>

      <title>Formation of Giant Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant planets dominate the mass of many planetary systems, including the Solar System, and represent the best-characterized class of extrasolar planets. Understanding the formation of giant planets bridges the high mass end of the planet formation process and the low mass end of processes that produce stellar and brown dwarf companions. This review examines the latest evidence supporting the formation of Solar System giant planets and most extrasolar giant planets by core accretion. Key elements of this theory and recent advances are discussed, along with the role of gravitational fragmentation of gas disks -- a mechanism more likely to produce brown dwarfs and/or similarly massive binary companions.</description>

      <title>Systematic opacity calculations for kilonovae -- II. Improved atomic data for singly ionized lanthanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanides play most important roles in the opacities for kilonova, ultraviolet-optical-infrared emission from neutron star mergers. Although several efforts have been made to construct atomic data, the accuracy in the opacity is not fully assessed and understood. In this paper, we perform atomic calculations for singly ionized lanthanides with improved strategies, aiming at understanding the physics of the lanthanide opacities in kilonova ejecta and necessary accuracy in atomic data. Our results show systematically lower energy level distributions as compared with our previous study (Paper I). As a result, the opacities evaluated with our new results are higher by a factor of up to 3 - 10, depending on the element and wavelength range. For a lanthanide-rich element mixture, our results give a higher opacity than that in Paper I by a factor of about 1.5. We also present opacities by using the results of ab-initio atomic calculations by using Grasp2K code. In general, our new opacities show good agreements with those with ab-initio calculations. We identify that structure of the lanthanide opacities are controlled by transition arrays among several configurations, for which derivation of accurate energy level distribution is important to obtain reliable opacities.</description>

      <title>The vertical shear instability in protoplanetary discs as an outwardly travelling wave. I. Linear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the global linear theory of the vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary discs with an imposed radial temperature gradient. We focus on the regime in which the VSI has the form of a travelling inertial wave that grows in amplitude as it propagates outwards. Building on previous work describing travelling waves in thin astrophysical discs, we develop a quantitative theory of the wave motion, its spatial structure and the physical mechanism by which the wave is amplified. We find that this viewpoint provides a useful description of the large-scale development of the VSI in global numerical simulations, which involves corrugation and breathing motions of the disc. We contrast this behaviour with that of perturbations of smaller scale, in which the VSI grows into a nonlinear regime in place without significant radial propagation.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Occurrence Rate with Age for FGK Stars in Kepler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure exoplanet occurrence rate as a function of isochrone and gyrochronology ages using confirmed and candidate planets identified in Q1-17 DR25 Kepler data. We employ Kepler's pipeline detection efficiency to correct for the expected number of planets in each age bin. We examine the occurrence rates for planets with radii $0.2 \leq Rp \leq 20$ R$_\oplus$ and orbital periods $0.2 \leq P \leq 100$ days for FGK stars with ages between $1.5-8$ Gyr using the inverse detection efficiency method. We find no significant trend between occurrence rate and stellar ages; a slight, decreasing trend (within $1.5-2.5$ $\sigma$) only emerges for low-mass and metal-rich stars that dominate our sample. We isolate the effects of mass and metallicity on the occurrence rate trend with age, but find the results to be inconclusive due to weak trends and small sample size. Our results hint that the exoplanet occurrence rate may decrease over time due to dynamical instability from planet-planet scattering or planet ejection, but accurate ages and larger sample sizes are needed to resolve a clear relation between occurrence rate and age.</description>

      <title>Dust characterization of protoplanetary disks: a guide to multi-wavelength analyses and accurate dust mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm $\to$ 7.46 mm range) to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer than 3 mm. High-resolution (&lt; 0.03"-0.05") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However, lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>HD 206893 B at High Spectral Resolution with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric characterization and orbital analysis of HD 206893 B, an exceptionally red, L/T-transition substellar companion in a multiplanetary system, via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution (R $\sim$ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. Using PHOENIX atmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the companion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at $&gt;8\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an effective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of $4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we measure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \pm 0.02$, or near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits the tentative trend of $&gt;4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios while less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using substellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of $22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this companion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893 B and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital stability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an orbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893 c, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture of the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk fragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiter engulfment by a red giant in 3D hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are gas giant planets with orbital periods of a few days and are found in 0.1-1% of Sun-like stars. They are expected to be engulfed during their host star's radial expansion on the red giant branch, which may account for observed rapidly rotating and chemically enriched giant stars. We performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of hot Jupiter engulfment by a 1 solar mass, 4 solar radii early red giant. Our 'global' simulations simultaneously resolve the stellar envelope and planetary structure, modelling the hot Jupiter as a polytropic gas sphere. The hot Jupiter spirals in due to ram-pressure drag. A substantial fraction of its mass is continuously ablated in this process, although the mass-loss rate is resolution dependent. We estimate that this could enhance the surface lithium abundance by up to 0.1 dex. The hot Jupiter is disrupted by a combination of ram pressure and tidal forces near the base of the convective envelope, with the deepest material penetrating to the radiative zone. The star experiences modest spin-up (~ 1 km/s), and engulfing a more massive companion may be required to produce a rapidly rotating giant. Drag heating near the surface and hydrogen recombination in the small amount of unbound ejecta recorded in the simulation could power an optical transient, although this needs to be confirmed by a calculation that has adequate resolution at the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>Many Roads Lead to Lithium: Formation Pathways For Lithium-Rich Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar models predict that lithium (Li) inside a star is destroyed during the first dredge-up phase, yet 1.2% of red giant stars are Li-rich. We aim to uncover possible origins of this population, by analysing 1155 Li-rich giants (A(Li) $\geq$ 1.5) in GALAH DR3. To expose peculiar traits of Li-rich stars, we construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelg\"anger) stars with matched evolutionary state and fiducial supernova abundances. Comparing Li-rich and doppelg\"anger spectra reveals systematic differences in the H-$\alpha$ and Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement. We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with $v_\textrm{broad} \gtrsim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) compared to doppelg\"angers. On average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelg\"angers, for a subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean $s-$process abundances ($\geq 0.05$ dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their doppelg\"angers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries with mass ratios $\gtrsim$ 0.5 at $\gtrsim$ 7 AU. We also discover that highly Ba-enriched stars are missing from the Li-rich population, possibly due to low-mass AGB companions which preclude Li-enrichment. Finally, we confirm a prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits, including binary spin-up and mass-transfer, are therefore likely mechanisms of Li-enrichment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10314v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>Gaia Data Release 3: spectroscopic binary-star orbital solutions. The SB1 processing chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia is an astrometric space experiment that is measuring positions, proper motions as well as parallaxes for a huge number of stars. It operates a medium-dispersion spectrometer, the RVS, that provides spectra and thus radial velocity time-series. The paper is centred on the analysis of the RV time-series. We try to fit orbital and trend models and restrict ourselves to the objects of spectral types F-G-K brighter than magnitude 12 presenting only one single spectrum (SB1). Suitable time-series are processed and analysed object per object, providing orbital or trend solutions. The results of the various fits are further filtered on the basis of several quality measures in order to discard spurious solutions. The objects only having a spectroscopic solution are classified in one of the three classes SB1 (eccentric model), SB1C (circular model) or TrendSB1 (mere trend model). We detail the methods used and describe the derived parameters and results. After a description of the models considered, and of the related quality tests of the fit, we detail the internal filtering that is intended to reject bad solutions. We also present a full validation of the pipeline. A description of the current content of the catalogue is provided. We present the SB1, SB1C and the TrendSB1 spectroscopic solutions contained in the SB-subcatalogue which is part of the DR3 catalogue. We delivered some 181327 orbital solutions in the class SB1, 202 in the class SB1C and 56808 in the associated class TrendSB1. This is a first release and the delivered SB-subcatalogue could be tuned and refined. However the majority of the entries are correct; this data set constitutes by far the largest set of spectroscopic orbital solutions ever constituted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>Mass-transferring binary stars as progenitors of interacting hydrogen-free supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are H-poor transients produced at the end of the life of massive stars that previously lost their H-rich envelope. Their progenitors are thought to be donor stars in mass-transferring binary systems, which were stripped of their H-rich envelopes some $10^6$yr before core collapse. A subset of the stripped-envelope SNe exhibit spectral and photometric features indicative of interaction between their ejecta and nearby circumstellar material (CSM). We examine whether mass transfer during, or shortly before, core collapse in massive binary systems can produce the CSM inferred from the observations of interacting H-poor SNe. We select 44 models from a comprehensive grid of detailed binary evolution models in which the mass donors are H-free and explode while transferring mass to a main-sequence companion. We find that in these models, mass transfer starts less than $\sim20$kyr before, and often continues until the core collapse of the donor star. Up to $0.8M_\odot$ of H-free material are removed from the donor star during this phase, which may produce a He-rich circumbinary material. We explore plausible assumptions for its spatial distribution at the time of explosion. When assuming that the CSM accumulates in a circumbinary disk, we find qualitative agreement with the supernova and CSM properties inferred from observed Type Ibn SNe, and to a lesser extent with constraints from Type Icn SNe. We find that our mass transferring stripped envelope SN progenitor models may produce up to $\sim$10% of all stripped envelope supernovae. The binary channel proposed in this work can qualitatively account for the observed key properties and rate of interacting H-poor SNe. Models for the evolution of the circumbinary material and the spectral evolution of exploding progenitors from this channel are needed to further test its significance.</description>

Abstract: The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to understanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even how planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion rates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph ($R \sim 800$, 3500-5500\r{A}) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly releasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which can also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code fits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each VIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between model parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach self-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a thorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not accomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates of each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to results separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to results from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions. Finally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were found among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful improvement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs observed by VIRUS or other spectrographs.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photons from intermediate-mass to very massive stars with PARSEC</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Evolutionary Fits for Jupiter and Saturn Incorporating Fuzzy Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent realization that there likely are stably-stratified regions in the interiors of both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct new non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous evolutionary models with the same microphysics for each that result at the present time in respectable fits for all major bulk observables for both planets. These include the effective temperature, radius, atmospheric heavy-element and helium abundances (including helium rain), and the lower-order gravity moments J2 and J4. The models preserve from birth most of an extended "fuzzy" heavy-element core. Our predicted atmospheric helium mass fraction for Saturn is ~0.2, close to some measured estimates, but in disagreement with some published predictions. To preserve a fuzzy core from birth, the interiors of both planets must start out at lower entropies than would be used for traditional "hot start" adiabatic models, though the initial exterior mantle entropies can range from hot to warm start values. We do not see a helium ocean in Saturn's interior, and both models have inner envelopes with significant Brunt-Vaisala frequencies; this region for Saturn at the current epoch is more extended and in it, the Brunt is larger. The total heavy-element mass fraction in Jupiter and in Saturn is determined to be ~14% and ~26%, respectively, though there is some play in these determinations.</description>

      <title>The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field</title>

Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE: An ultra-faint $\simeq$ 10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ Pop III Galaxy Candidate and First Constraints on the Pop III UV Luminosity Function at $z\simeq6-7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11678</link>

Abstract: Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.</description>
