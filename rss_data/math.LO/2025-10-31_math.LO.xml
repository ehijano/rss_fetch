      <title>Open cell property in weakly o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an o-minimal structure, Wilkie proved that every bounded definable open set is a finite union of definable open cells. We generalze it to weakly o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>Integration in finite terms and exponentially algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop techniques at the interface between differential algebra and model theory to study the following problems of exponential algebraicity: Does a given algebraic differential equation admits an exponentially algebraic solution, that is, a holomorphic solution which is definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? Do solutions of a given list of algebraic differential equations share a nontrivial exponentially algebraic relation, that is, a nontrivial relation definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions?
  These problems can be traced back to the work of Abel and Liouville on the problem of integration in finite terms. This article concerns generalizations of their techniques adapted to the study of exponential transcendence and independence problems for more general systems of differential equations. As concrete applications, we obtain exponential transcendence and independence statements for several classical functions: the error function, the Bessel functions, indefinite integrals of algebraic expressions involving Lambert's W-function, the equation of the pendulum, as well as corresponding decidability results.</description>

      <title>The power of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two consistent constructions of trees $T$ whose finite power $T^{n+1}$ is sharply different from $T^n$:
  1. An $\aleph_1$-tree $T$ whose interval topology $X_T$ is perfectly normal, but $(X_T)^2$ is not even countably metacompact.
  2. For an inaccessible $\kappa$ and a positive integer $n$, a $\kappa$-tree such that all of its $n$-derived trees are Souslin and all of its $(n+1)$-derived trees are special.</description>

      <title>Freely adding one layer of quantifiers to a Boolean doctrine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the layer of quantifier alternation depth at most one of the quantifier completion of a Boolean doctrine over a small category. This amounts to a doctrinal version of Herbrand's theorem for formulas with quantifier alternation depth at most one modulo a universal theory. The resulting construction satisfies a universal property that makes it the free QA-one-step Boolean doctrine.
  To achieve this version of Herbrand's theorem, we characterize, within the doctrinal setting, the classes $A$ of quantifier-free formulas for which there is a model $M$ such that $A$ is precisely the class of formulas whose universal closure is valid in $M$.</description>

      <title>Looking for stabilizers in NSOP$\_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study some examples of groups definable and type-definable in NSOP1 theories. We exhibit some behaviors of these groups that differ from the ones of simple groups. We take interest in the notions of generics and stabilizers, and define the Kim-stabilizer. We apply the notion of Kim-stabilizer and the stabilizer from Hrushovsky to the context of a group G definable in an NSOP1 field F satisfying some assumptions to show that there is a finite to one embedding of a type definable subgroup of G of bounded index into an algebraic group over F. We then show that definable groups in omega-free PAC fields satisfy these conditions.</description>

      <title>Abstract computation over first-order structures. Part IIb: Moschovakis' operator and other non-determinisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BSS RAMs were introduced to provide a mathematical framework for characterizing algorithms over first-order structures. Non-deterministic BSS RAMs help to model different non-deterministic approaches. Here, we deal with different types of binary non-determinisms and study the consequences of the decidability of the identity relation and the decidability of finite sets consisting of one or two constants. We compare the binary non-determinism resulting from a non-deterministic branching process, the digital non-determinism resulting from the restriction of guesses to two constants, and some other non-determinisms resulting from the use of Moschovakis' operator applied to oracle sets restricted to tuples of constants. Moreover, we show that the performance capability and the efficiency of individual machines are influenced by the following properties. 1. The identity relation belongs to the underlying structure. 2. The identity is semi-decidable over the underlying structure. 3. Two single-element sets of constants are semi-decidable. 4. A set of two constants is semi-decidable. The order of these properties corresponds to the strength of their influence. In all cases mentioned, the semi-decidability of the sets implies their decidability.</description>
