      <title>Mapping Innovation Networks: A Network-Based Approach to Actor Heterogeneity in National Innovation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Triple Helix model has provided a foundational framework for analyzing National Innovation Systems by highlighting the roles of universities, industries, and government research institutes. However, increasing heterogeneity within these actor groups limits the explanatory power of typological approaches. This study introduces a capability-based network methodology that maps the structural relationships among innovation actors based on the similarity of their research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities. Drawing on Economic Complexity Theory, we measure each actor's revealed comparative advantage (RCA) across scientific and technological fields and construct an R&amp;D Actor Space - a proximity-based network that reflects the relational configuration of innovation capacities. Applying this method to Korean R&amp;D data, we uncover a stratified system in which central, highly diversified universities coexist with more specialized firms and government institutes. Network analysis reveals assortative and unequal structures, and hierarchical clustering further highlights layered subgroupings. By moving beyond categorical classification, this capability-based network approach provides a scalable and generalizable tool for analyzing structural complexity within national innovation systems.</description>

      <title>Suppressing secondary shock waves in jam-absorption driving via string-stable support vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a freeway-driving strategy, jam-absorption driving (JAD) clears a shock wave (i.e., an upstream-moving congestion wave) by modulating the velocity of a single vehicle (called the absorbing vehicle) upstream of the wave, and improves traffic performances such as fuel consumption and collision risk. However, the deceleration of the absorbing vehicle causes trailing vehicles to slow down, generating secondary shock waves that undermine these benefits. This study proposes a method to suppress secondary shock waves by controlling the behavior of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) upstream of the absorbing vehicle, which are called support vehicles (SVs). A string-stability-based control method is applied in which SVs dynamically extend their time gaps to provide support driving (SD) for JAD. Numerical simulations using a traffic stream composed of 2000 vehicles, including five SVs, revealed that SD damped perturbations caused by the absorbing vehicle and prevented secondary shock waves, consistent with the head-to-tail string stability criterion. The combination of JAD and SD reduced total fuel consumption by 109 kg and collision risk (inverse time-to-collision) by 1940 compared with the JAD-only method, but increased total travel time by 49.3 hours. Reverting the extended time gap to its initial value reduced total travel time by 27.1 hours while maintaining low collision risk compared with the non-reverting method, albeit with increased total fuel consumption by 113 kg. SD alone could not eliminate the target shock wave. The results indicate that combining JAD and SD effectively eliminates the target shock wave while suppressing the secondary shock waves with guaranteed string stability even with only six CAVs (an absorbing vehicle and five SVs) out of 2000 vehicles, which is consistent with low CAV penetration rates anticipated in early implementation stages.</description>

      <title>Experimental Physics Laboratory 2: Calculating the Value of Water Density using Metal Rod and Water Container</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed analysis of an undergraduate physics laboratory experiment designed to determine the density of water using fundamental measurement techniques and data analysis methods. The experimental setup consists of a precision scale, a graduated container filled with water, and a suspended metal rod held by a crank, allowing for controlled displacement measurements. The primary objective of this experiment is to reinforce essential concepts in experimental physics, particularly in deriving physical models that correlate measurable quantities, performing precise measurements, and analyzing data using regression techniques via ordinary least squares methods for fitting data into linear models. This article aims to provide students with a theoretical and computational aid to explore the physical interpretations of this experiment. I developed a theoretical framework to introduce the fundamental concepts of hydrostatics, Newtonian mechanics, and the primary equations used in the experiment. I supplied Python code with thorough explanations that performs analysis on the experiment.</description>

      <title>A statistical mechanical view of complex economies under the green transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a stylized model of a complex economy to explore the economic tradeoffs imposed by the so called "green transition" -- the shift towards more sustainable production paradigms -- using tools from the Statistical Mechanics of disordered systems. Namely, we promote the parameters of a standard input-output economic model to random variables, in order to characterize the typical statistical properties of its equilibria. A central feature of our work is the explicit inclusion of a waste variable as a proxy for the unwanted byproducts, such as emissions, generated by different production processes. We find that the interplay between economic development and waste gives rise to a double phase transition, separating a region of viable economic activity from two distinct shutdown regimes. Notably, more wasteful ("brown") economies support a larger number of technologies per good but fail to activate most of them, limiting their productive capacity. In contrast, "greener" economies, while having access to fewer technologies, tend to achieve higher economic welfare, up to a critical point where rapid growth under tight waste constraints may destabilize them. Our results highlight the structural tensions between technological development and environmental sustainability, suggesting that the green transition may require careful navigation to avoid abrupt collapses in economic activity. The nature of the phase transitions we observe in the model is linked to the shrinkage of feasible economic configurations under increasing constraints, akin to algorithmic phase transitions studied in Computer Science.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Heider Balance Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Heider balance theory models the evolution of social networks towards balanced states with stress minimization. Triad relationships are classically either balanced or imbalanced. However, real-world relationships often exhibit uncertainty, complexity, and interconnected dynamics that transcend this classical framework, and we will sometimes see the synchronicity of balance and imbalance states. When these triadics are simultaneously balanced and imbalanced, they form superposition and entanglement states that necessitate the introduction of quantum balance. This study introduces a framework that extends classical Heider balance theory from social network analysis by incorporating principles of quantum mechanics. In the framework, each triad is a quantum state of spin systems embedded in various network topologies. Using a quantum transformation operator, we investigate the emergence of balanced and imbalanced states and identify ground and steady states. In the quantum state, developments towards balance will occur by introducing the Hamiltonian within the creation and annihilation operators framework. In these developments, we witness the emergence of superposition and entanglement quantum states with no classical equivalent, which form an uncertainty in the states. When the quantum evolution is a functional temperature, we investigate the emergence of balanced and imbalanced states, analyze ground and steady states, and examine phase transitions as a function of temperature. Our results reveal novel dynamical behaviors unique to quantum social systems and offer a new perspective on collective decision-making, conflict resolution, and emergent order in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Analytical Framework for Evaluating Traffic Capacity Impacts of Electric Vehicles' Regenerative Braking Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regenerative braking (RB) significantly influences electric vehicle (EV) car-following (CF) dynamics, yet traditional traffic-flow models rarely capture these effects. We introduce a comprehensive empirical dataset comprising 197.5 hours of driving data from 25 drivers across eight EV models to systematically investigate regen-induced CF behaviors. Two primary CF patterns emerge: (i) steady-state scenarios where EVs use regenerative braking and subsequently re-accelerate to equilibrium speeds with larger spacing, and (ii) dynamic scenarios involving lead oscillations, characterized by a distinctive three-phase CF process-regenerative deceleration, transitional plateau, and rapid re-acceleration. The paper's main contribution is the development of an analytical framework that models these EV-specific CF behaviors and quantifies their impacts on traffic capacity. We derive closed-form expressions for the established $\eta$ function from the literature, explicitly quantifying EV driving deviations from stable CF defined by Newell's CF model and assessing their implications for roadway capacity. Validation against empirical data and simulation confirm the model's accuracy ($R^2=0.96$) in replicating real-world $\eta$ trajectories. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that increased RB intensity, prolonged transitions, and shorter reaction delays significantly raise values and cumulative capacity losses. These findings highlight a clear trade-off between enhanced energy recovery through RB and reduced traffic efficiency, providing critical insights for EV-aware traffic modeling, control strategies, and transportation policy.</description>
