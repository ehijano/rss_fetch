      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions and high-dimensional chaos: comparing dynamics and statistics of equilibria in a solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a model of high-dimensional dynamical variables with all-to-all interactions that are random and non-reciprocal. We characterize its phase diagram and point out that the model can exhibit chaotic dynamics. We show that the equations describing the system's dynamics exhibit a number of equilibria that is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the system, and these equilibria are all linearly unstable in the chaotic phase. Solving the effective equations governing the dynamics in the infinite-dimensional limit, we determine the typical properties (magnetization, overlap) of the configurations belonging to the attractor manifold. We show that these properties cannot be inferred from those of the equilibria, challenging the expectation that chaos can be understood purely in terms of the numerous unstable equilibria of the dynamical equations. We discuss the dependence of this scenario on the strength of non-reciprocity in the interactions. These results are obtained through a combination of analytical methods such as Dynamical Mean-Field Theory and the Kac-Rice formalism.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis of noisy neural field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons in the brain show great diversity in their individual properties and their connections to other neurons. To develop an understanding of how neuronal diversity contributes to brain dynamics and function at large scales we borrow from the framework of replica methods, that has been successfully applied to a large class of problems with quenched noise in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We analyze two linearized versions of Wilson-Cowan model with random coefficients which are correlated in space. In particular: (A) a model where the properties of the neurons themselves are heterogeneous and (B) where their connectivities are anisotropic. In both of these models, the averaging over the quenched randomness gives rise to additional nonlinearities. These nonlinearities are analyzed within the framework of Wilsonian renormalization group. We find that for Model A, if the spatial correlation of noise decays with distance with an exponent smaller than $-2$, at large spatial scales the effect of the noise vanishes. By contrast, for model B, the effect of noise in neuronal connectivity vanishes only if the spatial correlations decay with an exponent smaller than $-1$. Our calculations also suggest that the presence of noise, under certain conditions, can give rise to travelling wave like behavior at large scales, although it remains to be seen whether this result remains valid at higher orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. We show that, for trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z=2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Monopole current control in artificial spin ice via localized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice systems are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets arranged on a lattice, exhibiting geometrical frustration and emergent phenomena such as monopole excitations. We explore magnetization dynamics and monopole current control in square artificial spin ice with added vertical control elements. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we examine how localized magnetic fields from these elements influence vertex configurations and domain propagation, enabling directional and polarity control of monopole currents. The control elements suppress monopole nucleation along one edge, steering monopole flow across the lattice, sometimes even against the applied field direction. These elements also reshape the system's energy landscape, producing tailored hysteresis and guided state transitions. Our results offer a strategy for manipulating collective behaviours in artificial spin ice using localized fields. This has implications for magnetic memory, physical reservoir computing, enabling reconfigurable magnetic logic and spin-based information processing, and device architectures requiring directional magnetic charge transport.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the Random Matrix Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor of random matrix theory plays a key role in the description of disordered and chaotic quantum systems. While its moments are known to be approximately Gaussian, corrections subleading in the matrix dimension, $D$, have recently come to attention, with conflicting results in the literature. In this work, we investigate these departures from Gaussianity for both circular and Gaussian ensembles. Using two independent approaches -- sine-kernel techniques and supersymmetric field theory -- we identify the form factor statistics to next leading order in a $D^{-1}$ expansion. Our sine-kernel analysis highlights inconsistencies with previous studies, while the supersymmetric approach backs these findings and suggests an understanding of the statistics from a complementary perspective. Our findings fully agree with numerics. They are presented in a pedagogical way, highlighting new pathways (and pitfalls) in the study of statistical signatures at next leading order, which are increasingly becoming important in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of measurement-induced entanglement phase transition in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Energy Landscape of RBMs: Reciprocal Space Insights into Bosons, Hierarchical Learning and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have become ubiquitous due to their ability to learn and sample from complex distributions. Despite the proliferation of various frameworks, the relationships among these models remain largely unexplored, a gap that hinders the development of a unified theory of AI learning. We address two central challenges: clarifying the connections between different deep generative models and deepening our understanding of their learning mechanisms. We focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), known for their universal approximation capabilities for discrete distributions. By introducing a reciprocal space formulation, we reveal a connection between RBMs, diffusion processes, and coupled Bosons. We show that at initialization, the RBM operates at a saddle point, where the local curvature is determined by the singular values, whose distribution follows the Marcenko-Pastur law and exhibits rotational symmetry. During training, this rotational symmetry is broken due to hierarchical learning, where different degrees of freedom progressively capture features at multiple levels of abstraction. This leads to a symmetry breaking in the energy landscape, reminiscent of Landau theory. This symmetry breaking in the energy landscape is characterized by the singular values and the weight matrix eigenvector matrix. We derive the corresponding free energy in a mean-field approximation. We show that in the limit of infinite size RBM, the reciprocal variables are Gaussian distributed. Our findings indicate that in this regime, there will be some modes for which the diffusion process will not converge to the Boltzmann distribution. To illustrate our results, we trained replicas of RBMs with different hidden layer sizes using the MNIST dataset. Our findings bridge the gap between disparate generative frameworks and also shed light on the processes underpinning learning in generative models.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and chaos in complex ecological communities with delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the wide range of dynamics observed in ecological communities is challenging due to the large number of species involved, the complex network of interactions among them, and the influence of multiple environmental variables. Here, we consider a general framework to model the dynamics of species-rich communities under the effects of external environmental factors, showing that it naturally leads to delayed interactions between species, and analyze the impact of such memory effects on population dynamics. Employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with time delays and random interactions, we characterize the resulting dynamical phases in terms of the statistical properties of community interactions. Our findings reveal that memory effects can generate persistent and synchronized oscillations in species abundances in sufficiently competitive communities. This provides an additional explanation for synchronization in large communities, complementing known mechanisms such as predator-prey cycles and environmental periodic variability. Furthermore, we show that when reciprocal interactions are negatively correlated, time delays alone can induce chaotic behavior. This suggests that ecological complexity is not a prerequisite for unpredictable population dynamics, as intrinsic memory effects are sufficient to generate long-term fluctuations in species abundances. The techniques developed in this work are applicable to any high-dimensional random dynamical system with time delays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, the entropy of a subsystem (smaller than half the system size) thermalizes if at long times, it is to leading order equal to the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem at the same energy. In this paper, we prove entropy thermalization for a nearly integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model initialized in a pure product state. The model is obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body interactions as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model.</description>

      <title>Loop Series Expansions for Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</description>

      <title>On learning higher-order cumulants in diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To analyse how diffusion models learn correlations beyond Gaussian ones, we study the behaviour of higher-order cumulants, or connected n-point functions, under both the forward and backward process. We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs.</description>
