      <title>Generative AI for subgrid turbulence in large-eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence governs the transport of momentum, energy, and scalars in many geophysical and engineering flows. In large-eddy simulations (LES), parameterizing subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses remains a central challenge, as unresolved physical processes strongly influence turbulent transport. Traditional SGS models, such as the Smagorinsky-type models and deep neural networks (DNNs), are deterministic and cannot capture the stochastic nature of turbulence. Despite its wide application in computer vision and natural language processing, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has not previously been applied to directly compute SGS stresses in three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers at high Reynolds numbers. Here we introduce a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to reconstruct SGS stresses from coarse-grained velocity fields in direct numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer. The DDPM consistently outperforms Smagorinsky-type models and previous deep neural networks in terms of spatial correlations and probability distributions for deviatoric stresses, and can be applied to unseen convective stability conditions and resolutions. By learning conditional distributions rather than pointwise values, this generative approach opens a new direction for SGS turbulence modeling at high Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Lacking oceanic-driven internal multidecadal climate variability is compensated by forced variability in model simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regional climate change in the $21^{st}$ century will result from the interplay between human-induced changes and internal climate variability. Competing effects from greenhouse gas warming and aerosol cooling have historically caused multidecadal forced climate variations overlapping with internal variability. Despite extensive historical observations, disentangling the contributions of internal and forced variability remains debated, largely due to the uncertain magnitude of anthropogenic aerosols.
  Here, we show that, after removing CO$_{2}$-congruent variability, multidecadal temperature variability in instrumental data is largely attributable to internal processes of oceanic origin. This follows from an emergent relationship, identified in historical climate model simulations, between the driver of variability in oceanic regions and the land-ocean variance ratio in the mid-latitudes. Thus, climate models with higher residual (non-CO$_{2}$) forced variability, largely linked to volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols, exhibit more spatially coherent and amplified temperature patterns over land compared to observations. In contrast, models with higher internal variability agree better with the instrumental data. Our results underscore that internal modes of ocean-driven variability may be too weak in many climate models, and that current projections may be underestimating the range of internal variability in regions with high oceanic influence.</description>

      <title>An Analytical and AI-discovered Stable, Accurate, and Generalizable Subgrid-scale Closure for Geophysical Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Data Assimilation with GenCast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation is widely used in many disciplines such as meteorology, oceanography, and robotics to estimate the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. In this work, we propose a lightweight and general method to perform data assimilation using diffusion models pre-trained for emulating dynamical systems. Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.</description>
