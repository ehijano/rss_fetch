      <title>A Pharmacy Benefit Manager Insurance Business Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is time to move on from attempts to make the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reseller business model more transparent. Time and time again the Big 3 PBMs have developed opaque alternatives to piece-meal 100% pass-through mandates. Time and time again PBMs have demonstrated expertise in finding loopholes in state government disclosure laws. The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative estimates of two transparent insurance business models as a solution to the PBM agency issue. The key parameter used is an 8% gross profit margin figure disclosed by the Big 3 PBMs themselves. Based on reported drug trend delivered to plans, we use a $1,200 to $1,500 per member per year (PMPY) as the range for this key performance indicator (KPI). We propose that discussions of PBM insurance business models start with the following figures: (1) a fixed premium model with medical loss ratio ranging from 92% to 85%; (2) a fee-for-service model ranging from $96 to $180 PMPY with risk sharing of deviations from a contracted PMPY delivered drug spend.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Scaling Laws and Phase Transitions in Consumer Advertising Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how consumers respond to business advertising efforts is essential for optimizing marketing investment. This research introduces a new modeling approach based on the concepts of symmetries and scaling laws in physics to describe consumer response to advertising dynamics. Drawing from mathematical frameworks used in physics and social sciences, we propose a model that accounts for a key aspect: the saturation effect. The model is validated against commonly used models, including the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, showing its ability to better capture nonlinearities in advertising effects. We introduce new key parameters like Marketing Sensitivity, Response Sensitivity, and Behavioral Sensitivit, that offer additional insights into the drivers of audience engagement and advertising performance. Our model provides a rigorous yet practical tool for understanding audience behavior, contributing to the improvement of budget allocation strategies.</description>
