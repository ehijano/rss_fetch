      <title>Unifying Listener Scoring Scales: Comparison Learning Framework for Speech Quality Assessment and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition (CSER) are two key tasks in speech technology, both relying on listener ratings. However, these ratings are inherently biased due to individual listener factors. Previous approaches have introduced a mean listener scoring scale and modeled all listener scoring scales in the training set. However, the mean listener approach is prone to distortion from averaging ordinal data, leading to potential biases. Moreover, learning multiple listener scoring scales while inferring based only on the mean listener scale limits effectiveness. In contrast, our method focuses on modeling a unified listener scoring scale, using comparison scores to correctly capture the scoring relationships between utterances. Experimental results show that our method effectively improves prediction performance in both SQA and CSER tasks, proving its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>TGIF: Talker Group-Informed Familiarization of Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art target speaker extraction (TSE) systems are typically designed to generalize to any given mixing environment, necessitating a model with a large enough capacity as a generalist. Personalized speech enhancement could be a specialized solution that adapts to single-user scenarios, but it overlooks the practical need for customization in cases where only a small number of talkers are involved, e.g., TSE for a specific family. We address this gap with the proposed concept, talker group-informed familiarization (TGIF) of TSE, where the TSE system specializes in a particular group of users, which is challenging due to the inherent absence of a clean speech target. To this end, we employ a knowledge distillation approach, where a group-specific student model learns from the pseudo-clean targets generated by a large teacher model. This tailors the student model to effectively extract the target speaker from the particular talker group while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline generic models by adapting to the unique speech characteristics of a given speaker group. Our newly proposed TGIF concept underscores the potential of developing specialized solutions for diverse and real-world applications, such as on-device TSE on a family-owned device.</description>

      <title>Feature-based analysis of oral narratives from Afrikaans and isiXhosa children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development. This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency, with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.</description>

Abstract: Russian speech synthesis presents distinctive challenges, including vowel reduction, consonant devoicing, variable stress patterns, homograph ambiguity, and unnatural intonation. This paper introduces Balalaika, a novel dataset comprising more than 2,000 hours of studio-quality Russian speech with comprehensive textual annotations, including punctuation and stress markings. Experimental results show that models trained on Balalaika significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both speech synthesis and enhancement tasks. We detail the dataset construction pipeline, annotation methodology, and results of comparative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Temporal Adaptation of Pre-trained Foundation Models for Music Structure Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-based music structure analysis (MSA) is an essential task in Music Information Retrieval that remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of musical form. Recent advances highlight the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained music foundation models for MSA tasks. However, these models are typically trained with high temporal feature resolution and short audio windows, which limits their efficiency and introduces bias when applied to long-form audio. This paper presents a temporal adaptation approach for fine-tuning music foundation models tailored to MSA. Our method enables efficient analysis of full-length songs in a single forward pass by incorporating two key strategies: (1) audio window extension and (2) low-resolution adaptation. Experiments on the Harmonix Set and RWC-Pop datasets show that our method significantly improves both boundary detection and structural function prediction, while maintaining comparable memory usage and inference speed.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Parameterized Multi-channel Wiener Filter using a tiny neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise suppression and speech distortion are two important aspects to be balanced when designing multi-channel Speech Enhancement (SE) algorithms. Although neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art noise suppression, their non-linear operations often introduce high speech distortion. Conversely, classical signal processing algorithms such as the Parameterized Multi-channel Wiener Filter ( PMWF) beamformer offer explicit mechanisms for controlling the suppression/distortion trade-off. In this work, we present NeuralPMWF, a system where the PMWF is entirely controlled using a low-latency, low-compute neural network, resulting in a low-complexity system offering high noise reduction and low speech distortion. Experimental results show that our proposed approach results in significantly better perceptual and objective speech enhancement in comparison to several competitive baselines using similar computational resources.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ASR for Catalan-Spanish Code-Switching: A Comparative Analysis of Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS, widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face. Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.</description>

      <title>Open Automatic Speech Recognition Models for Classical and Modern Standard Arabic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other, the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we open-source the models and their training recipes.</description>

      <title>OpenBEATs: A Fully Open-Source General-Purpose Audio Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked token prediction has emerged as a powerful pre-training objective across language, vision, and speech, offering the potential to unify these diverse modalities through a single pre-training task. However, its application for general audio understanding remains underexplored, with BEATs being the only notable example. BEATs has seen limited modifications due to the absence of open-source pre-training code. Furthermore, BEATs was trained only on AudioSet, restricting its broader downstream applicability. To address these gaps, we present OpenBEATs, an open-source framework that extends BEATs via multi-domain audio pre-training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six types of tasks, twenty five datasets, and three audio domains, including audio reasoning tasks such as audio question answering, entailment, and captioning. OpenBEATs achieves state-of-the-art performance on six bioacoustics datasets, two environmental sound datasets and five reasoning datasets, performing better than models exceeding a billion parameters at one-fourth their parameter size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-domain datasets and masked token prediction task to learn general-purpose audio representations. To promote further research and reproducibility, we release all pre-training and evaluation code, pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, and training logs at https://shikhar-s.github.io/OpenBEATs</description>

      <title>A lightweight and robust method for blind wideband-to-fullband extension of speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing the bandwidth of speech is common practice in resource constrained environments like low-bandwidth speech transmission or low-complexity vocoding. We propose a lightweight and robust method for extending the bandwidth of wideband speech signals that is inspired by classical methods developed in the speech coding context. The resulting model has just ~370K parameters and a complexity of ~140 MFLOPS (or ~70 MMACS). With a frame size of 10 ms and a lookahead of only 0.27 ms, the model is well-suited for use with common wideband speech codecs. We evaluate the model's robustness by pairing it with the Opus SILK speech codec (1.5 release) and verify in a P.808 DCR listening test that it significantly improves quality from 6 to 12 kb/s. We also demonstrate that Opus 1.5 together with the proposed bandwidth extension at 9 kb/s meets the quality of 3GPP EVS at 9.6 kb/s and that of Opus 1.4 at 18 kb/s showing that the blind bandwidth extension can meet the quality of classical guided bandwidth extensions thus providing a way for backward-compatible quality improvement.</description>

      <title>Incremental Averaging Method to Improve Graph-Based Time-Difference-of-Arrival Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the position of a speech source based on time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) is often adversely affected by background noise and reverberation. A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a microphone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone pairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of microphone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of microphone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently a more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs by computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT function reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on the TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT functions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral densities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we increase the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs computed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals recorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially distributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations and three reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering multiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation accuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely on a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position estimation.</description>

      <title>Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.</description>

      <title>Align Your Rhythm: Generating Highly Aligned Dance Poses with Gating-Enhanced Rhythm-Aware Feature Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically generating natural, diverse and rhythmic human dance movements driven by music is vital for virtual reality and film industries. However, generating dance that naturally follows music remains a challenge, as existing methods lack proper beat alignment and exhibit unnatural motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Danceba, a novel framework that leverages gating mechanism to enhance rhythm-aware feature representation for music-driven dance generation, which achieves highly aligned dance poses with enhanced rhythmic sensitivity. Specifically, we introduce Phase-Based Rhythm Extraction (PRE) to precisely extract rhythmic information from musical phase data, capitalizing on the intrinsic periodicity and temporal structures of music. Additionally, we propose Temporal-Gated Causal Attention (TGCA) to focus on global rhythmic features, ensuring that dance movements closely follow the musical rhythm. We also introduce Parallel Mamba Motion Modeling (PMMM) architecture to separately model upper and lower body motions along with musical features, thereby improving the naturalness and diversity of generated dance movements. Extensive experiments confirm that Danceba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significantly better rhythmic alignment and motion diversity.

      <title>Source Separation by Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of single-channel audio source separation with the goal of reconstructing $K$ sources from their mixture. We address this ill-posed problem with FLOSS (FLOw matching for Source Separation), a constrained generation method based on flow matching, ensuring strict mixture consistency. Flow matching is a general methodology that, when given samples from two probability distributions defined on the same space, learns an ordinary differential equation to output a sample from one of the distributions when provided with a sample from the other. In our context, we have access to samples from the joint distribution of $K$ sources and so the corresponding samples from the lower-dimensional distribution of their mixture. To apply flow matching, we augment these mixture samples with artificial noise components to match the dimensionality of the $K$ source distribution. Additionally, as any permutation of the sources yields the same mixture, we adopt an equivariant formulation of flow matching which relies on a neural network architecture that is equivariant by design. We demonstrate the performance of the method for the separation of overlapping speech.</description>

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

      <title>MuteSwap: Visual-informed Silent Video Identity Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.</description>

      <title>Automatically assessing oral narratives of Afrikaans and isiXhosa children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13205</link>

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases, but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for children's learning.</description>
