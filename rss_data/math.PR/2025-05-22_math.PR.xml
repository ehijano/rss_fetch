      <title>Short survey of results and open problems for parking problems on random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parking problems derive from works in combinatorics by Konheim and Weiss in the 1960s. In a memorable contribution, Lackner and Panholzer (2016) studied parking on a random tree and established a phase transition for this process when \(m \approx \frac{n}{2}\). This relates to the renowned result by David Aldous of convergence results on Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random graphs of order \(n^{\frac{2}{3}}\). In a series of recent articles, Contat and coauthors have studied the problem in various random tree contexts and derived several novel scaling limit and phase transition results. We survey the present state-of-the-art of this literature and point to its extensions, open directions and possibilities, in particular related to the study of problem in different metric topologies. My intent it to point to importance of this line of research and novel open problems for future study.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom for Critical Random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random $k$-SAT problem serves as a model that represents the 'typical' $k$-SAT instances. This model is thought to undergo a phase transition as the clause density changes, and it is believed that the random $k$-SAT problem is primarily difficult to solve near this critical phase. In this paper, we introduce a weak formulation of degrees of freedom for random $k$-SAT problems and demonstrate that the critical random $2$-SAT problem has $\sqrt[3]{n}$ degrees of freedom. This quantity represents the maximum number of variables that can be assigned truth values without affecting the formula's satisfiability. Notably, the value of $\sqrt[3]{n}$ differs significantly from the degrees of freedom in random $2$-SAT problems sampled below the satisfiability threshold, where the corresponding value equals $\sqrt{n}$. Thus, our result underscores the significant shift in structural properties and variable dependency as satisfiability problems approach criticality.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium steady state for a three-mode energy cascade model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the central phenomenon of energy cascades in wave turbulence theory, we construct non-equilibrium statistical steady states (NESS), or invariant measures, for a simplified model derived from the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation with external forcing and dissipation. This new perspective to studying energy cascades, distinct from traditional analyses based on kinetic equations and their cascade spectra, focuses on the underlying statistical steady state that is expected to hold when the cascade spectra of wave turbulence manifest.
  In the full generality of the (infinite dimensional) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, constructing such invariant measures is more involved than the rigorous justification of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) spectra, which itself remains an outstanding open question despite the recent progress on mathematical wave turbulence. Since such complexity remains far beyond the current knowledge (even for much simpler chain models), we confine our analysis to a three-mode reduced system that captures the resonant dynamics of the NLS equation, offering a tractable framework for constructing the NESS. For this, we introduce a novel approach based on solving an elliptic Feynman-Kac equation to construct the needed Lyapunov function.</description>

      <title>Multiple chordal SLE($\kappa$) and quantum Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiple chordal SLE$(\kappa)$ systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, where $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ are boundary starting points, and $q \in \partial \Omega$ is an additional marked boundary point.
  Based on the framework introduced in \cite{Dub07}, we show that the partition functions in the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$ satisfy both the null vector equations and a dilatation equation with scaling constant $d$.
  We show that the presence of the marked boundary point $q$ introduces a natural equivalence relation among partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, a conformally covariant representative can always be chosen.
  Using techniques from the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct two distinct families of solutions, each indexed by a topological link pattern of type $(n,m)$, where $2m \leq n$.
  In the special case where $\Omega = \mathbb{H}$ and $q = \infty$, we demonstrate that these partition functions correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Moser system, extending the known correspondence beyond the standard $(2n,n)$ setting.</description>

      <title>Micro-canonical cascades and random homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the Fourier dimension formula for the Mandelbrot micro-canonical cascade measure. Combining with our previous work on the canonical cascade measure, we complete the Mandelbrot-Kahane problem of the Fourier decay of Mandelbrot's turbulence cascade measures. In addition, we get a two-sided Frostman regularity estimate of the microcanonical cascade measure. As a corollary, we show that almost surely the Dubins-Freedman random homeomorphism is bi-H\"older continuous with almost sharp exponents.</description>

      <title>Does freezing impede the growth of random recursive trees?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform attachment with freezing is an extension of the classical model of random recursive trees, in which trees are recursively built by attaching new vertices to old ones. In the model of uniform attachment with freezing, vertices are allowed to freeze, in the sense that new vertices cannot be attached to already frozen ones. We study the impact of removing attachment and/or freezing steps on the height of the trees. We show in particular that removing an attachment step can increase the expected height, and that freezing cannot substantially decrease the height of random recursive trees. Our methods are based on coupling arguments.</description>

      <title>Expanded regimes of area law for lattice Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the parameter regimes for which area law is proven for pure $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories, in particular when $N$ is large. This improves on a classical result of Osterwalder-Seiler from 1978. To do so, we view the master loop equation as a linear inhomogeneous equation for Wilson string expectations, and then prove an a priori bound for solutions to the equation. The main novelty is in how we deal with the merger term in the master loop equation. This is done by introducing a truncated model for which the merger term is unproblematic, and then showing that the truncated model well approximates the original model.</description>

      <title>Open interacting particle systems and Ising measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first survey some open questions concerning stochastic interacting particle systems with open boundaries. Then, an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the open ASEP (one extremal-current phase) or in the conventional KLS model (one or three extremal-current phases).</description>

      <title>Quantitative delocalization for solid-on-solid models at high temperature and arbitrary tilt</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of integer-valued random interface models on the two-dimensional square lattice that include the solid-on-solid model and more generally $p$-SOS models for $0&lt;p\le2$, and prove that at sufficiently high temperature the interface is delocalized logarithmically uniformly in the boundary data. Fr\"ohlich and Spencer had studied the analogous problem with free boundary data, and our proof is based on their multi-scale argument, with various technical improvements.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur Model with Internal Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we proposed a stochastic version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, and gave a criterion for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the stochastic model on an open submanifold of the Euclidean space, by which we show that the solutions of our stochastic model are well-defined and unique. We also prove the invariance of the submanifold, which is a biologically feasible result. The asymptotic estimates of the solution are obtained, indicating the at most exponential growth of the population. Some numerical experiments are performed and illustrate the discrepancy between the deterministic and stochastic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the convergence of additive functionals under the determinantal point process with the confluent hypergeometric kernel, corresponding to a sufficiently smooth function $f(x/R)$, as $R\to\infty$. We show that these functionals approach Gaussian distribution and give an estimate on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. To obtain these results we derive an exact identity for expectations of multiplicative functionals in terms of Fredholm determinants.</description>

      <title>Neural Field Equations with random data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <title>Arrival Control in Quasi-Reversible Queueing Systems: Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We first propose an alternative definition of quasi-reversibility that encompasses reversibility and highlights the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that supplementing a quasi-reversible queueing system with a balanced arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of non-linear observables of fractal Gaussian fields with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on composite operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical properties of non-linear observables of the fractal Gaussian field $\phi(\vec x)$ of negative Hurst exponent $H&lt;0$ in dimension $d$ are revisited with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on the properties of the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $. For the special case $n=2$ of quadratic observables, explicit results include the cumulants of arbitrary order, the L\'evy-Khintchine formula for the characteristic function and the anomalous large deviations properties. The case of observables of arbitrary order $n&gt;2$ is analyzed via the Wiener-Ito chaos-expansion for functionals of the white noise: the multiple stochastic Ito integrals are useful to identify the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $ and to compute their correlations involving the Hurst exponents $H_n=nH$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for Patterson--Sullivan systems with applications to random walks and entropy rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Patterson--Sullivan systems, which consist of a group action on a compact metrizable space and a quasi-invariant measure which behaves like a classical Patterson--Sullivan measure. For such systems we prove a generalization of Tukia's measurable boundary rigidity theorem. We then apply this generalization to (1) study the singularity conjecture for Patterson--Sullivan measures (or, conformal densities) and stationary measures of random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups, and discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups; (2) prove versions of Tukia's theorem for word hyperbolic groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and higher rank symmetric spaces; and (3) prove an entropy rigidity result for pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic spaces.</description>

Abstract: We determine the sharp threshold for the containment of all $n$-vertex trees of bounded degree in random geometric graphs with $n$ vertices. This provides a geometric counterpart of Montgomery's threshold result for binomial random graphs, and confirms a conjecture of Espuny D\'iaz, Lichev, Mitsche, and Wesolek. Our proof is algorithmic and adapts to other families of graphs, in particular graphs with bounded genus or tree-width.</description>

We compare two models, one with volume-scaled random fields, and another one with non-scaled random fields, on the level of Aizenman-Wehr metastates, Newman-Stein metastates, as well as overlap distributions. We show that in $d\geq 2$ the metastates are fully supported on a continuity of random product states, with weights which we describe, for both models. For the non-scaled random fields, the set of a.s. cluster points of Gibbs measures contains these product states, but behaves differently in the 'recurrent' spin dimension $d=2$ where it also contains non-trivial mixtures of tilted measures. For the scaled model, moreover the overlap distribution displays spin-glass characteristics, as it is non-self averaging, and shows replica symmetry breaking, although it is ultrametric if and only if $d=1$. For $d\geq 2$ it oscillates chaotically on a set of continuous distributions for large volumes, while the limiting set contains only discrete distributions in $d=1$. Our results are based on concentration estimates, analysis of Gibbs measures in finite but large volumes, and the asymptotics of $d$-dimensional random walks and their spherical projections.</description>

      <title>Critical Points of Random Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge, grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating a potential divergence in the number of critical points.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for BSDEs with jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the deep solver by Han, Jentzen, E (2018) to the case of forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process. We successfully apply our algorithm to option pricing problems in low and high dimension and discuss the applicability in the context of counterparty credit risk.</description>

      <title>Label propagation on binomial random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03569v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a label propagation algorithm (LPA) on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. Initially, given a network, each vertex starts with a random label in the interval $[0,1]$. Then, in each round of LPA, every vertex switches its label to the majority label in its neighborhood (including its own label). At the first round, ties are broken towards smaller labels, while at each of the next rounds, ties are broken uniformly at random. The algorithm terminates once all labels stay the same in two consecutive iterations. LPA is successfully used in practice for detecting communities in networks (corresponding to vertex sets with the same label after termination of the algorithm). Perhaps surprisingly, LPA's performance on dense random graphs is hard to analyze, and so far convergence to consensus was known only when $np\ge n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$, where LPA converges in three rounds. By defining an alternative label attribution procedure which converges to the label propagation algorithm after three rounds, a careful multi-stage exposure of the edges allows us to break the $n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$ barrier and show that, when $np \ge n^{5/8+\varepsilon}$, a.a.s.\ the algorithm terminates with a single label. Moreover, we show that, if $np\gg n^{2/3}$, a.a.s.\ this label is the smallest one, whereas if $n^{5/8+\varepsilon}\le np\ll n^{2/3}$, the surviving label is a.a.s.\ not the smallest one. En passant, we show a presumably new monotonicity lemma for Binomial random variables that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for semigroups associated with stochastic differential equations driven by cylindrical L\'{e}vy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via a Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula from [KPP23], we derive uniform gradient estimates for transition semigroups associated with stochastic differential equations driven by a large class of cylindrical L\'{e}vy processes which includes the important case of cylindrical $\alpha$-stable processes. As the first application, we formulate a Stein's method for quantitative approximation of the invariant measure of these stochastic differential equations in Wasserstein distance. As the second and main application, we study Euler-Maruyama numerical schemes of stochastic differential equations driven by stable L\'{e}vy processes with i.i.d. stable components and obtain a uniform-in-time approximation error in Wasserstein distance. Our approximation error has a linear dependence on the stepsize, which is expected to be tight, as can be seen from an explicit calculation for the case of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Interface motion from Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics of non-gradient type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on a $d$-dimensional periodic lattice of size $N$, that is, a stochastic time evolution of particles performing random walks with interaction subject to the exclusion rule (Kawasaki part), in general, of non-gradient type, together with the effect of the creation and annihilation of particles (Glauber part) whose rates are set to favor two levels of particle density, called sparse and dense. We then study the limit of our dynamics under the hydrodynamic space-time scaling, that is, $1/N$ in space and a diffusive scaling $N^2$ for the Kawasaki part and another scaling $K=K(N)$, which diverges slower, for the Glauber part in time. In the limit as $N\to\infty$, we show that the particles autonomously make phase separation into sparse or dense phases at the microscopic level, and an interface separating two regions is formed at the macroscopic level and evolves under an anisotropic curvature flow.
  In the present article, we show that the particle density at the macroscopic level is well approximated by a solution of a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlinear diffusion term of divergence form and a large reaction term. Furthermore, by applying the results of Funaki, Gu and Wang [arXiv:2404.12234] for the convergence rate of the diffusion matrix approximated by local functions, we obtain a quantitative hydrodynamic limit as well as the upper bound for the allowed diverging speed of $K=K(N)$.
  The above result for the derivation of the interface motion is proved by combining our result with that in a companion paper by Funaki and Park [arXiv:2403.01732], in which we analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the reaction-diffusion equation obtained in the present article and derived an anisotropic curvature flow in the situation where the macroscopic reaction term determined from the Glauber part is bistable and balanced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of probabilistic cellular automata that are capable of exhibiting rich dynamics such as synchronization and ergodicity and can be easily inferred from data. The system is a finite-state locally interacting Markov chain on a circular graph. Each site's subsequent state is random, with a distribution determined by its neighborhood's empirical distribution multiplied by a local transition matrix. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions on the local transition matrix for synchronization and ergodicity. Also, we introduce novel least squares estimators for inferring the local transition matrix from various types of data, which may consist of either multiple trajectories, a long trajectory, or ensemble sequences without trajectory information. Under suitable identifiability conditions, we show the asymptotic normality of these estimators and provide non-asymptotic bounds for their accuracy.</description>

      <title>From clonal interference to Poissonian interacting trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00793v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population whose size $N$ is fixed over the generations, and in which random beneficial mutations arrive at a rate of order $1/\log N$ per generation. In this so-called Gerrish--Lenski regime, typically a finite number of contending mutations are present together with one resident type. These mutations compete for fixation, a phenomenon addressed as clonal interference. We introduce and study a Poissonian system of interacting trajectories (PIT), and prove that it arises as a large population scaling limit of the logarithmic sizes of the contending clonal subpopulations in a continuous-time Moran model with strong selection. We show that the PIT exhibits an almost surely positive asymptotic rate of fitness increase (speed of adaptation), which turns out to be finite if and only if fitness increments have a finite expectation. We relate this speed to heuristic predictions from the literature. Furthermore, we derive a functional central limit theorem for the fitness of the resident population in the PIT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an extension of isotropic Gaussian random fields and Q-Wiener processes on d-dimensional spheres, isotropic Q-fractional Brownian motion is introduced and sample H\"older regularity in space-time is shown depending on the regularity of the spatial covariance operator Q and the Hurst parameter H. The processes are approximated by a spectral method in space for which strong and almost sure convergence are shown. The underlying sample paths of fractional Brownian motion are simulated by circulant embedding or conditionalized random midpoint displacement. Temporal accuracy and computational complexity are numerically tested, the latter matching the complexity of simulating a Q-Wiener process if allowing for a temporal error.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider a suitable generalization of the Feynman path integral on a specific class of Riemannian manifolds consisting of compact Lie groups with bi-invariant Riemannian metrics. The main tools we use are the Cartan development map, the notion of oscillatory integral, and the Chernoff approximation theorem. We prove that, for a class of functions of a dense subspace of the relevant Hilbert space, the Feynman map produces the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, where the Laplace-Beltrami operator coincides with the second order Casimir operator of the group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of a complex financial system may be assessed by measuring risk contagion between various financial institutions with relatively high exposure. We consider a financial network model using a bipartite graph of financial institutions (e.g., banks, investment companies, insurance firms) on one side and financial assets on the other. Following empirical evidence, returns from such risky assets are modeled by heavy-tailed distributions, whereas their joint dependence is characterized by copula models exhibiting a variety of tail dependence behavior. We consider CoVaR, a popular measure of risk contagion and study its asymptotic behavior under broad model assumptions. We further propose the Extreme CoVaR Index (ECI) for capturing the strength of risk contagion between risk entities in such networks, which is particularly useful for models exhibiting asymptotic independence. The results are illustrated by providing precise expressions of CoVaR and ECI when the dependence of the assets is modeled using two well-known multivariate dependence structures: the Gaussian copula and the Marshall-Olkin copula.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A~Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and analysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we account for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and heterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</description>
