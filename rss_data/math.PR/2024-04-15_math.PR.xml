      <title>Random walks on simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of Laplacian of a graph can be generalized to simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, and contains information on the topology of these structures. Even for a graph, the consideration of associated simplicial complexes is interesting to understand its shape. Whereas the Laplacian of a graph has a simple probabilistic interpretation as the generator of a continuous time Markov chain on the graph, things are not so direct when considering simplicial complexes. We define here new Markov chains on simplicial complexes. For a given order~$k$, the state space is the set of $k$-cycles that are chains of $k$-simplexes with null boundary. This new framework is a natural generalization of the canonical Markov chains on graphs. We show that the generator of our Markov chain is the upper Laplacian defined in the context of algebraic topology for discrete structure. We establish several key properties of this new process: in particular, when the number of vertices is finite, the Markov chain is positive recurrent. This result is not trivial, since the cycles can loop over themselves an unbounded number of times. We study the diffusive limits when the simplicial complexes under scrutiny are a sequence of ever refining triangulations of the flat torus. Using the analogy between singular and Hodge homologies, we express this limit as valued in the set of currents. The proof of tightness and the identification of the limiting martingale problem make use of the flat norm and carefully controls of the error terms in the convergence of the generator. Uniqueness of the solution to the martingale problem is left open. An application to hole detection is carried.</description>

      <title>Sticky dispersion on the complete graph: a kinetic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the dispersion process on the complete graph introduced in the recent work [17] under the mean-field framework. We adopt a kinetic perspective (as opposed to the probabilistic approach taken in [17] and many other related works) thanks to the reinterpretation of the model in terms of a novel econophysics model. Various analytical and quantitative results regarding the large time behaviour of the mean-field dynamics are obtained and supporting numerical illustrations are provided.</description>

      <title>Bond percolation does not simulate site percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a site percolation is a stronger model than a bond percolation. We use the van den Berg -- Kesten (vdBK) inequality to prove that site percolation on a neighborhood of a vertex of degree $3$ cannot be simulated even approximately by bond percolation, and develop a decision tree technique to prove the same for a neighborhood of a vertex of degree $2$. This technique can be used to obtain inequalities for connectedness probabilities, including a conjectured inequality of Erik Aas.</description>

      <title>On the First Passage Times of Branching Random Walks in $\mathbb R^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first passage times of discrete-time branching random walks in ${\mathbb R}^d$ where $d\geq 1$. Here, the genealogy of the particles follows a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We provide asymptotics of the first passage times to a ball of radius one with a distance $x$ from the origin, conditioned upon survival. We provide explicitly the linear dominating term and the logarithmic correction term as a function of $x$. The asymptotics are precise up to an order of $o_{\mathbb P}(\log x)$ for general jump distributions and up to $O_{\mathbb P}(\log\log x)$ for spherically symmetric jumps. A crucial ingredient of both results is the tightness of first passage times. We also discuss an extension of the first passage time analysis to a modified branching random walk model that has been proven to successfully capture shortest path statistics in polymer networks.</description>

      <title>On the Condensation and fluctuations in reversible coagulation-fragmentation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the condensation phenomenon for the invariant measures of the mean-field model of reversible coagulation-fragmentation processes conditioned to a supercritical density of particles. It is shown that when the parameters of the associated balance equation satisfy a subexponential tail condition, there is one single giant particle that corresponds to the missing mass in the macroscopic limit. We also show that in this case, the rest of the particles are asymptotically \emph{i.i.d.} according to the normalized equilibrium state of the limit hydrodynamic differential equation. Conditions for the normal fluctuations and the $\alpha$-stable fluctuations around the condensed mass are given. We obtain the large deviation principle for the empirical measure of the masses of the particles at equilibrium as well.</description>

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough \cite{Chatterjee}, Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model \cite{Edwards1975} utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in \cite{Chatterjee}. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Coupling results and Markovian structures for number representations of continuous random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general setting for nested subdivisions of a bounded real set into intervals defining the digits $X_1,X_2,...$ of a random variable $X$ with a probability density function $f$ is considered. Under the weak condition that $f$ is almost everywhere lower semi-continuous, a coupling between $X$ and a non-negative integer-valued random variable $N$ is established so that $X_1,...,X_N$ have an interpretation as the ``sufficient digits'', since the distribution of $R=(X_{N+1},X_{N+2},...)$ conditioned on $S=(X_1,...,X_N)$ does not depend on $f$. Adding a condition about a Markovian structure of the lengths of the intervals in the nested subdivisions, $R\,|\,S$ becomes a Markov chain of a certain order $s\ge0$. If $s=0$ then $X_{N+1},X_{N+2},...$ are IID with a known distribution. When $s&gt;0$ and the Markov chain is uniformly geometric ergodic, a coupling is established between $(X,N)$ and a random time $M$ so that the chain after time $\max\{N,s\}+M-s$ is stationary and $M$ follows a simple known distribution. The results are related to several examples of number representations generated by a dynamical system, including base-$q$ expansions, generalized L\"uroth series, $\beta$-expansions, and continued fraction representations. The importance of the results and some suggestions and open problems for future research are discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the average $p-$Wasserstein distance between a finite sample of an infinite hyperuniform point process on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and its mean for any $p\geq 1$. The average Wasserstein transport cost is shown to be bounded from above and from below by some multiples of the number of points. More generally, we give a control on the $p-$Wasserstein distance in function of a control on the $L^p$ norm of the difference of the point process and its mean.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study the long time behavior of linear functionals of branching diffusion processesas well as the time reversal of the spinal process by means of spectral properties of the Feynman-Kacsemigroup. We generalize for this non Markovian semigroup the theory of quasi-stationary distribution(q.s.d.) and Q-process. The most amazing result is the identification of the law of the reversal time spinalprocess issued from q.s.d. with the Q-process of the Feynman-Kac semigroup.</description>

Abstract: Let n points be taken at random on a circle of unit circumference and clockwise ordered. Uniform spacings are defined as the clockwise arc-lengths between the successive points from this sample. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the sum of functions of the m-tuples of successive spacings under the assumption that m can grow together with n. Asymptotic formulas for the expectation and variance of the sum and its asymptotic normality are established.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle at speed $n^d$ for the random metric in first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the standard first passage percolation model on $\mathbb Z^d$ with bounded and bounded away from zero weights. We show that the rescaled passage time $\widetilde{\mathbf T}_{n,X}$ restricted to a compact set $X$ satisfies a large deviation principle (LDP) at speed $n^d$ in a space of geodesic metrics, i.e. an estimation of the form $\mathbb P\left( \widetilde {\mathbf T}_{n,X } \approx D \right)\approx\exp\left(-I(D)n^d \right)$ for any metric $D$. Moreover, $I(D)$ can be written as the integral over $X$ of an elementary cost. Consequences include LDPs at speed $n^d$ for the point--point passage time, the face--face passage time and the random ball of radius $n$. Our strategy consists in proving the existence of $\lim_{n\to\infty}-\frac{1}{n^d}\log \mathbb P \left(\widetilde{\mathbf T}_{n,[0,1]^d} \approx g \right)$ for any norm $g$ with a multidimensional subaddivity argument, then using this result as an elementary building block to estimate $\mathbb P \left( \widetilde{\mathbf T}_{n,X} \approx D \right) $ for any metric $D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider fractional derivatives of local time for $d-$dimensional centered Gaussian processes satisfying certain strong local nondeterminism property. We first give a condition for existence of fractional derivatives of the local time defined by Marchaud derivatives in $L^p(p\ge1)$ and show that these derivatives are H\"older continuous with respect to both time and space variables and are also continuous with respect to the order of derivatives. Moreover, under some additional assumptions, we show that this condition is also necessary for existence of derivatives of the local time with the help of contour integration.</description>

      <title>Villain action in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Villain interaction applied to lattice gauge theory can be obtained as the limit of both Wilson and Manton interactions on a larger graph which we call the {\em carpet graph.} This is the lattice gauge theory analog of a well-known property for spin $O(N)$ models where Villain type interactions are the limit of $\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ spin systems defined on a {\em cable graph}.
  Perhaps surprisingly in the setting of lattice gauge theory, our proof also applies to non-Abelian lattice theory such as $SU(3)$-lattice gauge theory and its limiting Villain interaction.
  In the particular case of an Abelian lattice gauge theory, this allows us to extend the validity of Ginibre inequality to the case of the Villain interaction.</description>

      <title>Survival and extinction for a contact process with a density-dependent birth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study later spatial evolutionary games based on the multitype contact process, we first focus in this paper on the conditions for survival/extinction in the presence of only one strategy, in which case our model consists of a variant of the contact process with a density-dependent birth rate. The players are located on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice, with natural birth rate $\lambda$ and natural death rate one. The process also depends on a payoff $a_{11} = a$ modeling the effects of the players on each other: while players always die at rate one, the rate at which they give birth is given by $\lambda$ times the exponential of $a$ times the fraction of occupied sites in their neighborhood. In particular, the birth rate increases with the local density when $a &gt; 0$, in which case the payoff $a$ models mutual cooperation, whereas the birth rate decreases with the local density when $a &lt; 0$, in which case the payoff $a$ models intraspecific competition. Using standard coupling arguments to compare the process with the basic contact process (the particular case $a = 0$), we prove that, for all payoffs $a$, there is a phase transition from extinction to survival in the direction of $\lambda$. Using various block constructions, we also prove that, for all birth rates $\lambda$, there is a phase transition in the direction of $a$. This last result is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the nonspatial deterministic mean-field model in which the stability of the extinction state only depends on $\lambda$. This underlines the importance of space (local interactions) and stochasticity in our model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the stationary relaxed singular control problem within a multi-dimensional framework for a single agent, as well as its Mean Field Game (MFG) equivalent. We demonstrate that optimal relaxed controls exist for both maximization and minimization cases. These relaxed controls are defined by random measures across the state and control spaces, with the state process described as a solution to the associated martingale problem. By leveraging findings from [Kurtz-Stockbridge 2001], we establish the equivalence between the martingale problem and the stationary forward equation. This allows us to reformulate the relaxed control problem into a linear programming problem within the measure space. We prove the sequential compactness of these measures, thereby confirming the feasibility of achieving an optimal solution. Subsequently, our focus shifts to Mean Field Games. Drawing on insights from the single-agent problem and employing Kakutani--Glicksberg--Fan fixed point theorem, we derive the existence of a mean field game equilibria.</description>

      <title>State-Space Systems as Dynamic Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic framework to study the dependence structure induced by deterministic discrete-time state-space systems between input and output processes is introduced. General sufficient conditions are formulated under which output processes exist and are unique once an input process has been fixed, a property that in the deterministic state-space literature is known as the echo state property. When those conditions are satisfied, the given state-space system becomes a generative model for probabilistic dependences between two sequence spaces. Moreover, those conditions guarantee that the output depends continuously on the input when using the Wasserstein metric. The output processes whose existence is proved are shown to be causal in a specific sense and to generalize those studied in purely deterministic situations. The results in this paper constitute a significant stochastic generalization of sufficient conditions for the deterministic echo state property to hold, in the sense that the stochastic echo state property can be satisfied under contractivity conditions that are strictly weaker than those in deterministic situations. This means that state-space systems can induce a purely probabilistic dependence structure between input and output sequence spaces even when there is no functional relation between those two spaces.</description>

      <title>Convergence of coordinate ascent variational inference for log-concave measures via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field variational inference (VI) is the problem of finding the closest product (factorized) measure, in the sense of relative entropy, to a given high-dimensional probability measure $\rho$. The well known Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm aims to approximate this product measure by iteratively optimizing over one coordinate (factor) at a time, which can be done explicitly. Despite its popularity, the convergence of CAVI remains poorly understood. In this paper, we prove the convergence of CAVI for log-concave densities $\rho$. If additionally $\log \rho$ has Lipschitz gradient, we find a linear rate of convergence, and if also $\rho$ is strongly log-concave, we find an exponential rate. Our analysis starts from the observation that mean field VI, while notoriously non-convex in the usual sense, is in fact displacement convex in the sense of optimal transport when $\rho$ is log-concave. This allows us to adapt techniques from the optimization literature on coordinate descent algorithms in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Strongly Tail-Optimal Scheduling in the Light-Tailed M/G/1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling jobs in a queueing system, specifically an M/G/1 with light-tailed job sizes, to asymptotically optimize the response time tail. This means scheduling to make $\mathbf{P}[T &gt; t]$, the chance a job's response time exceeds $t$, decay as quickly as possible in the $t \to \infty$ limit. For some time, the best known policy was First-Come First-Served (FCFS), which has an asymptotically exponential tail: $\mathbf{P}[T &gt; t] \sim C e^{-\gamma t}$. FCFS achieves the optimal *decay rate* $\gamma$, but its *tail constant* $C$ is suboptimal. Only recently have policies that improve upon FCFS's tail constant been discovered. But it is unknown what the optimal tail constant is, let alone what policy might achieve it.
  In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal tail constant $C$, and we introduce *$\gamma$-Boost*, a new policy that achieves this optimal tail constant. Roughly speaking, $\gamma$-Boost operates similarly to FCFS, but it pretends that small jobs arrive earlier than their true arrival times. This significantly reduces the response time of small jobs without unduly delaying large jobs, improving upon FCFS's tail constant by up to 50% with only moderate job size variability, with even larger improvements for higher variability. While these results are for systems with full job size information, we also introduce and analyze a version of $\gamma$-Boost that works in settings with partial job size information, showing it too achieves significant gains over FCFS. Finally, we show via simulation that $\gamma$-Boost has excellent practical performance.</description>

      <title>Queues with resetting: a perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance modeling is a key issue in queuing theory and operation research. It is well-known that the length of a queue that awaits service or the time spent by a job in a queue depends not only on the service rate, but also crucially on the fluctuations in service time. The larger the fluctuations, the longer the delay becomes and hence, this is a major hindrance for the queue to operate efficiently. Various strategies have been adapted to prevent this drawback. In this perspective, we investigate the effects of one such novel strategy namely resetting or restart, an emerging concept in statistical physics and stochastic complex process, that was recently introduced to mitigate fluctuations-induced delays in queues. In particular, we show that a service resetting mechanism accompanied with an overhead time can remarkably shorten the average queue lengths and waiting times. We examine various resetting strategies and further shed light on the intricate role of the overhead times to the queuing performance. Our analysis opens up future avenues in operation research where resetting-based strategies can be universally promising.</description>

      <title>Prevalence estimation methods for time-dependent antibody kinetics of infected and vaccinated individuals: a graph-theoretic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immune events such as infection, vaccination, and a combination of the two result in distinct time-dependent antibody responses in affected individuals. These responses and event prevalences combine non-trivially to govern antibody levels sampled from a population. Time-dependence and disease prevalence pose considerable modeling challenges that need to be addressed to provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning of the underlying biology. We propose a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for anti-body kinetics and demonstrate its use in a setting in which individuals can be infected or vaccinated but not both. We prove the equivalency of this approach to the framework developed in our previous work. Synthetic data are used to demonstrate the modeling process and conduct prevalence estimation via transition probability matrices. This approach is ideal to model sequences of infections and vaccinations, or personal trajectories in a population, making it an important first step towards a mathematical characterization of reinfection, vaccination boosting, and cross-events of infection after vaccination or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving approximations for stochastic incompressible viscous fluids and SPDEs on group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-term dynamics of particles involved in an incompressible flow with a small viscosity ($\epsilon&gt;0$) and slow chemical reactions, is depicted by a class of stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equations with a fast advection term of magnitude $1/\epsilon$. It has been shown in [7] the fast advection asymptotics of stochastic RDA equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be characterized through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) on the graph associated with certain Hamiltonian. To simulate such fast advection asymptotics, we introduce and study an asymptotic-preserving (AP) exponential Euler approximation for the multiscale stochastic RDA equation. There are three key ingredients in proving asymptotic-preserving property of the proposed approximation. First, a strong error estimate, which depends on $1/\epsilon$ linearly, is obtained via a variational argument. Second, we prove the consistency of exponential Euler approximations on the fast advection asymptotics between the original problem and the SPDE on graph. Last, a graph weighted space is introduced to quantify the approximation error for SPDE on graph, which avoids the possible singularity near the vertices. Numerical experiments are carried out to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Entropy on the Path Space and Application to Singular Diffusions and Mean-field Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a (partly) new approach for the study of McKean-Vlasov equations, including singular interactions. This approach is based on the relativeentropy on the path space in the spirit of our previous works together with C. L{\'e}onard. Itis also used in a recent work of D. Lacker.We show how it can be used to derive existence and uniqueness for some singular diffusions, in particular linear mean field stochastic particle systems and non linear SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, including Lp- Lq models, the 2D vortex model associated to the 2D Navier-Stokes equation, sub-Coulombic interactions models or the Patlak-Keller-Segel model.We also show the convergence and propagation of chaos as the number of particles grows to infinity. This is obtained at the process level, not only at the Liouville equation level.The paper thus contains new proofs and extensions of known results, as well as new results.The main results are given at the end of the Introduction.</description>

      <title>Swarm dynamics for global optimisation on finite sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the global optimisation of a function $U$ defined on a finite set $V$ endowed with an irreducible and reversible Markov generator.By integration, we  extend $U$ to the set $\mathcal{P}(V)$ of probability distributions on $V$ and we penalise it with a time-dependent generalised entropy functional.Endowing $\mathcal{P}(V)$ with a Maas' Wasserstein-type Riemannian structure, enables us to consider an associated time-inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithm.There are several ways to interpret this $\cP(V)$-valued dynamical system as the time-marginal laws of a time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process taking values in $V$, each of them allowing for interacting particle approximations.This procedure extends to the discrete framework the continuous state space swarm algorithm approach of Bolte, Miclo and Villeneuve \cite{Bolte}, but here we go further by considering more general generalised entropy functionals for which functional inequalities can be proven.Thus in the full generality of the above finite framework, we  give conditions on the underlying time dependence ensuring the convergence of the algorithm toward laws supported by the set of global minima of $U$.Numerical simulations illustrate that one has to be careful about the choice of the time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process  interpretation.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of exponential random graphs and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper in 2009, Borcea, Br\"and\'en, and Liggett described the connection between probability distributions and the geometry of their generating polynomials. Namely, they characterized that stable generating polynomials correspond to distributions with the strongest form of negative dependence. This motivates us to investigate other distributions that can have this property, and our focus is on random graph models. In this article, we will lay the groundwork to investigate Markov random graphs, and more generally exponential random graph models (ERGMs), from this geometric perspective. In particular, by determining when their corresponding generating polynomials are either stable and/or Lorentzian. The Lorentzian property was first described in 2020 by Br\"and\'en and Huh and independently by Anari, Oveis-Gharan, and Vinzant where the latter group called it the completely log-concave property. The theory of stable polynomials predates this, and is commonly thought of as the multivariate notion of real-rootedness. Br\"and\'en and Huh proved that stable polynomials are always Lorentzian. Although it is a strong condition, verifying stability is not always feasible. We will characterize when certain classes of Markov random graphs are stable and when they are only Lorentzian. We then shift our attention to applications of these properties to real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Plus Strategies are Exponentially Slower for Planted Optima of Random Height</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the $(1,\lambda)$-EA and the $(1 + \lambda)$-EA on the recently introduced benchmark DisOM, which is the OneMax function with randomly planted local optima. Previous work showed that if all local optima have the same relative height, then the plus strategy never loses more than a factor $O(n\log n)$ compared to the comma strategy. Here we show that even small random fluctuations in the heights of the local optima have a devastating effect for the plus strategy and lead to super-polynomial runtimes. On the other hand, due to their ability to escape local optima, comma strategies are unaffected by the height of the local optima and remain efficient. Our results hold for a broad class of possible distortions and show that the plus strategy, but not the comma strategy, is generally deceived by sparse unstructured fluctuations of a smooth landscape.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric density estimation for the small jumps of L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the density of the process associated with the small jumps of a pure jump L\'evy process, possibly of infinite variation, from discrete observations of one trajectory. The interest of such a question lies on the observation that even when the L\'evy measure is known, the density of the increments of the small jumps of the process cannot be computed. We discuss results both from low and high frequency observations. In a low frequency setting, assuming the L\'evy density associated with the jumps larger than $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ in absolute value is known, a spectral estimator relying on the convolution structure of the problem achieves minimax parametric rates of convergence with respect to the integrated $L_2$ loss, up to a logarithmic factor. In a high frequency setting, we remove the assumption on the knowledge of the L\'evy measure of the large jumps and show that the rate of convergence depends both on the sampling scheme and on the behaviour of the L\'evy measure in a neighborhood of zero. We show that the rate we find is minimax up to a log-factor. An adaptive penalized procedure is studied to select the cutoff parameter. These results are extended to encompass the case where a Brownian component is present in the L\'evy process. Furthermore, we illustrate the performances of our procedures through an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersal of propagules (seeds, spores) from a geographically isolated population into an uninhabitable matrix can threaten population persistence if it prevents new growth from keeping pace with mortality. Quantifying propagule loss can thus inform restoration and conservation of vulnerable populations in fragmented landscapes. To model propagule loss in detail, one can integrate dispersal kernels (probabilistic descriptions of dispersal) and plant densities. However, one might lack the detailed spatial information and computational tools needed by such integral models. Here we derive two upper bounds on the probability of propagule loss--one assuming rotational symmetry of dispersal and the other not--that require only habitat area, habitat perimeter, and the mean dispersal distance of a propagule. We compare the bounds to simulations of integral models for the population of Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed) at McKnight Prairie--a 13.7 hectare reserve surrounded by agricultural fields in Goodhue County, Minnesota--and identify conditions under which the bounds closely estimate propagule loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a state space and a Markov process associated to the stochastic quantisation equation of Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) theories. The state space $\mathcal{S}$ is a nonlinear metric space of distributions, elements of which can be used as initial conditions for the (deterministic and stochastic) YMH flow with good continuity properties. Using gauge covariance of the deterministic YMH flow, we extend gauge equivalence $\sim$ to $\mathcal{S}$ and thus define a quotient space of "gauge orbits" $\mathfrak{O}$. We use the theory of regularity structures to prove local in time solutions to the renormalised stochastic YMH flow. Moreover, by leveraging symmetry arguments in the small noise limit, we show that there is a unique choice of renormalisation counterterms such that these solutions are gauge covariant in law. This allows us to define a canonical Markov process on $\mathfrak{O}$ (up to a potential finite time blow-up) associated to the stochastic YMH flow.</description>

Abstract: We study microscopic observables of the Discrete Gaussian model (i.e., the Gaussian free field restricted to take integer values) at high temperature using the renormalisation group method. In particular, we show the central limit theorem for the two-point function of the Discrete Gaussian model by computing the asymptotic of the moment generating function $\langle e^{z (\sigma (0) - \sigma (y))} \rangle_{\beta, \mathbb{Z}^2}^{\dg}$ for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ sufficiently small. The method we use has direct connection with the multi-scale polymer expansion used in \cite{dgauss1, dgauss2}, where it was used to study the scaling limit of the Discrete Gaussian model. The method also applies to multi-point functions and lattice models of sine-Gordon type studied in \cite{MR634447}.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Markov Chains with an Aggregator and their Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a subclass of stochastic processes called discrete-time nonlinear Markov chains with an aggregator. In these chains, the next period's distribution of the process depends on both the current state of the process and on a real-valued function of the current distribution of the process. For these chains, we provide conditions for the uniqueness of an invariant distribution and a simple method to find the unique invariant distribution, which do not rely on contraction arguments. Instead, the approach is based on flexible monotonicity properties imposed on the nonlinear Markov kernel. We demonstrate the necessity of these monotonicity conditions to prove the uniqueness of an invariant distribution by simple examples. We apply our findings to analyze stationary distributions in strategic queueing systems, identify conditions under which a class of nonlinear equations in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has a unique solution, and investigate the properties of wealth distributions in large dynamic economies.</description>

      <title>Size-biased diffusion limits and the inclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inclusion process on the complete graph with vanishing diffusivity, which leads to condensation of particles in the thermodynamic limit. Describing particle configurations in terms of size-biased and appropriately scaled empirical measures of mass distribution, we establish convergence in law of the inclusion process to a measure-valued Markov process on the space of probability measures. In the case where the diffusivity vanishes like the inverse of the system size, the derived scaling limit is equivalent to the well known Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, offering an alternative viewpoint on these well-established dynamics. Moreover, our approach covers all scaling regimes of the system parameters and yields a natural extension of the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion to infinite mutation rate. We also discuss in detail connections to known results on related Fleming-Viot processes.</description>

      <title>Percolation in lattice $k$-neighbor graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a random graph obtained via connecting each point of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ independently to a fixed number $1 \leq k \leq 2d$ of its nearest neighbors via a directed edge. We call this graph the directed $k$-neighbor graph. Two natural associated undirected graphs are the undirected and the bidirectional $k$-neighbor graph, where we connect two vertices by an undirected edge whenever there is a directed edge in the directed $k$-neighbor graph between them in at least one, respectively precisely two, directions. In these graphs we study the question of percolation, i.e., the existence of an infinite self-avoiding path. Using different kinds of proof techniques for different classes of cases, we show that for $k=1$ even the undirected $k$-neighbor graph never percolates, but the directed one percolates whenever $k \geq d+1$, $k \geq 3$ and $d \geq 5$, or $k \geq 4$ and $d=4$. We also show that the undirected $2$-neighbor graph percolates for $d=2$, the undirected $3$-neighbor graph percolates for $d=3$, and we provide some positive and negative percolation results regarding the bidirectional graph as well. A heuristic argument for high dimensions indicates that this class of models is a natural discrete analogue of the $k$-nearest-neighbor graphs studied in continuum percolation, and our results support this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric estimation of the reaction term in semi-linear SPDEs with spatial ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the non-parametric estimation of a non-linear reaction term in a semi-linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The estimator's consistency is due to the spatial ergodicity of the SPDE while the time horizon remains fixed. The analysis of the estimation error requires the concentration of spatial averages of non-linear transformations of the SPDE. The method developed in this paper combines the Clark-Ocone formula from Malliavin calculus with the Markovianity of the SPDE and density estimates. The resulting variance bound utilises the averaging effect of the conditional expectation in the Clark-Ocone formula. The method is applied to two realistic asymptotic regimes. The focus is on a coupling between the diffusivity and the noise level, where both tend to zero. Secondly, the observation of a fixed SPDE on a growing spatial observation window is considered. Furthermore, we prove the concentration of the occupation time around the occupation measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perturb the 3D Euler equations by a particular non-linear Stratonovich noise. We show the existence and uniqueness of a global-in-time (i.e. no blow-up) smooth solution. The result is a corollary of a more general theorem valid in an abstract framework, where the addition of such noise prevents the blow-up possibly induced by a drift with super-linear growth. The result is new with Stratonovich noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the central limit theorem for the free path length of the periodic Lorentz gas in the Boltzmann-Grad limit. Our proof relies on the connection between the distribution of the free path length of the periodic Lorentz gas and the expanding translates of a unipotent subgroup on the lattice space, which was described in the seminal works of Marklof-Str\"ombergsson. Moreover, we obtain the asymptotic formula of the distribution function of the free path length and also derive the central limit theorem for the counting function in the related lattice problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15228v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses convolutions of the gamma density and the one-sided stable density to construct higher level densities. The approach is applied to constructing a 4-parameter Mittag-Leffler density, whose Laplace transform is a corresponding Mittag-Leffler function, which is completely monotone (CM) by construction. Laplace transforms of mixtures of the stable densities with respect to the 4-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution are compositions of the Mittag-Leffler functions with Bernstein functions, thereby generating a rich family of CM variants of the base CM Mittag-Leffler functions, including known instances as special cases.</description>

      <title>Invariance principle and McKean-Vlasov limit for randomized load balancing in heavy traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a load balancing model where a Poisson stream of jobs arrive at a system of many servers whose service time distribution possesses a finite second moment. A small fraction of arrivals pass through the so called power-of-choice algorithm, which assigns a job to the shortest among $\ell$, $\ell\ge 2$, randomly chosen queues, and the remaining jobs are assigned to queues chosen uniformly at random. The system is analyzed at critical load in an asymptotic regime where both the number of servers and the usual heavy traffic parameter associated with individual queue lengths grow to infinity. The first main result is a hydrodynamic limit, where the empirical measure of the diffusively normalized queue lengths is shown to converge to a path in measure space whose density is given by the unique solution of a parabolic PDE with nonlocal coefficients.
  Further, two forms of an invariance principle are proved, corresponding to two different assumptions on the initial distribution, where individual normalized queue lengths converge weakly to solutions of SDE. In one of these results, the limit is given by a McKean-Vlasov SDE, and propagation of chaos holds. The McKean-Vlasov limit is closely related to limit results for Brownian particles on $\mathbb{R}_+$ interacting through their rank (with a specific interaction). However, an entirely different set of tools is required, as the collection of $n$ prelimit particles does not obey a Markovian evolution on $\mathbb{R}_+^n$.</description>

      <title>Subexponential lower bounds for $f$-ergodic Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for establishing lower bounds on the rate of convergence in $f$-variation of a continuous-time ergodic Markov process to its invariant measure. The criterion consists of novel super- and submartingale conditions for certain functionals of the Markov process. It provides a general approach for proving lower bounds on the tails of the invariant measure and the rate of convergence in $f$-variation of a Markov process, analogous to the widely used Lyapunov drift conditions for upper bounds. Our key technical innovation produces lower bounds on the tails of the heights and durations of the excursions from bounded sets of a continuous-time Markov process using path-wise arguments.
  We apply our theory to elliptic diffusions and L\'evy-driven stochastic differential equations with known polynomial/stretched exponential upper bounds on their rates of convergence. Our lower bounds match asymptotically the known upper bounds for these classes of models, thus establishing their rate of convergence to stationarity. The generality of the approach suggests that, analogous to the Lyapunov drift conditions for upper bounds, our methods can be expected to find applications in many other settings.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical system generated by the 3D Navier-Stokes equation with rough transport noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes system in three dimensions perturbed by a transport noise which is sufficiently smooth in space and rough in time. The existence of a weak solution was proved recently, however, as in the deterministic setting the question of uniqueness remains a major open problem. An important feature of systems with uniqueness is the semigroup property satisfied by their solutions. Without uniqueness, this property cannot hold generally. We select a system of solutions satisfying the semigroup property with appropriately shifted rough path. In addition, the selected solutions respect the well accepted admissibility criterium for physical solutions, namely, maximization of the energy dissipation. Finally, under suitable assumptions on the driving rough path, we show that the Navier-Stokes system generates a measurable random dynamical system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a measurable single-valued random dynamical system in the state space for an SPDE without uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Kohler-Jobin meets Ehrhard: the sharp lower bound for the Gaussian principal frequency while the Gaussian torsional rigidity is fixed, via rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an adaptation of the Kohler-Jobin rearrangement technique to the setting of the Gauss space. As a result, we prove the Gaussian analogue of the Kohler-Jobin's resolution of a conjecture of P\'{o}lya-Szeg\"o: when the Gaussian torsional rigidity of a (convex) domain is fixed, the Gaussian principal frequency is minimized for the half-space. At the core of this rearrangement technique is the idea of considering a "modified" torsional rigidity, with respect to a given function, and rearranging its layers to half-spaces, in a particular way; the Rayleigh quotient decreases with this procedure.
  We emphasize that the analogy of the Gaussian case with the Lebesgue case is not to be expected here, as in addition to some soft symmetrization ideas, the argument relies on the properties of some special functions; the fact that this analogy does hold is somewhat of a miracle.</description>

      <title>Suboptimal Performance of the Bayes Optimal Algorithm in Frequentist Best Arm Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the fixed-budget best arm identification problem with rewards following normal distributions. In this problem, the forecaster is given $K$ arms (or treatments) and $T$ time steps. The forecaster attempts to find the arm with the largest mean, via an adaptive experiment conducted using an algorithm. The algorithm's performance is evaluated by simple regret, reflecting the quality of the estimated best arm. While frequentist simple regret can decrease exponentially with respect to $T$, Bayesian simple regret decreases polynomially. This paper demonstrates that the Bayes optimal algorithm, which minimizes the Bayesian simple regret, does not yield an exponential decrease in simple regret under certain parameter settings. This contrasts with the numerous findings that suggest the asymptotic equivalence of Bayesian and frequentist approaches in fixed sampling regimes. Although the Bayes optimal algorithm is formulated as a recursive equation that is virtually impossible to compute exactly, we lay the groundwork for future research by introducing a novel concept termed the expected Bellman improvement.</description>

Abstract: We present two approaches to establish the exponential decay of correlation functions of Euclidean quantum field theories (EQFTs) via stochastic quantization (SQ). In particular we consider the elliptic stochastic quantization of the H{\o}egh--Krohn (or $\exp (\alpha \phi)_2$) EQFT in two dimensions. The first method is based on a path-wise coupling argument and PDE apriori estimates while the second on estimates of the Malliavin derivative of the solution to the SQ equation.</description>

      <title>A convergence result of a continuous model of deep learning via \L{}ojasiewicz--Simon inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a Wasserstein-type gradient flow, which represents an optimization process of a continuous model of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). First, we establish the existence of a minimizer for an average loss of the model under $L^2$-regularization. Subsequently, we show the existence of a curve of maximal slope of the loss. Our main result is the convergence of flow to a critical point of the loss as time goes to infinity. An essential aspect of proving this result involves the establishment of the \L{}ojasiewicz--Simon gradient inequality for the loss. We derive this inequality by assuming the analyticity of NNs and loss functions. Our proofs offer a new approach for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of Wasserstein-type gradient flows for nonconvex functionals.</description>
