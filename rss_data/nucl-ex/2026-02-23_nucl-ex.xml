      <title>First measurement of jet axis decorrelation with photon-tagged jets in pp and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first measurement of the jet axis decorrelation in events with jets recoiling from an isolated photon is presented for lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The jet axis decorrelation is the angular difference ($\Delta{j}$) between two definitions of the jet axis. This quantity is expected to be sensitive to the scattering of jet constituents in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Events which have a leading isolated photon with transverse momentum 60 $\lt$ $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}$ $\lt$ 200 GeV and recoiling jets with 30 $\lt$ $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{jet}}$ $\lt$ 100 GeV are selected for the analysis. The PbPb result is reported as a function of collision centrality and compared to pp reference data. Jets with $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{jet}}$ $\lt$ 60 GeV have consistent $\Delta{j}$ shapes for pp and PbPb collisions. However, a narrowing is observed for jets with $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{jet}}$ $\gt$ 60 GeV in central PbPb collisions. The results are compared to predictions from the JEWEL, PYQUEN, and HYBRID theoretical models, which include different descriptions of parton energy loss in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Development and Application of an eV Neutron Polarization for Parity Violation Studies at CSNS Back-n Beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic enhancement of symmetry-breaking effects in neutron-nucleus resonances provides a sensitive testing ground for Time-Reversal Invariance Violation (TRIV). Exploiting this mechanism, the Neutron Optics Parity and Time Reversal Experiment (NOPTREX) seeks to elucidate the origin of the universe's baryon asymmetry. Critical to this effort is the precise measurement of Parity Violation (PV) asymmetries, which is essential to calibrate the nuclear parameters required for future TRIV experiments. To facilitate these studies, we developed an eV polarized neutron at the Back-n white neutron beamline of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). Neutron polarization is generated by an in-situ Spin-Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP) $^3$He filter. Spin manipulation is performed by an adiabatic spin flipper, while spin polarization is preserved over the flight path by a vacuum transport system equipped with a solenoidal guide field. Experiments successfully measured an asymmetry of approximately $7.8 \pm 2.4$ (stat.) $\pm 0.3$ (sys.) % at the 0.747 eV p-wave resonance of $^{139}$La. These results are in agreement with previous results on this resonance and validate the system's capability for PV measurements.</description>

      <title>Producing and Studying Rare Isotopes in $e+A$ Collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron--Ion Collider (EIC) offers a unique environment to study kinematically controlled lepton--nucleus (e+A) reactions, where a primary hard scattering is followed by an intranuclear cascade and the subsequent statistical de-excitation of the nuclear remnant. Utilizing the BeAGLE model, we demonstrate that event-by-event fluctuations in nucleon removal and energy deposition populate a diverse ensemble of excited remnants. Furthermore, we show that varying the target mass systematically shifts the distribution of these remnants across the (N, Z) plane. Although this excited prefragment remnant is not directly observable, its properties are shown to be strongly correlated with final-state fragments; specifically, the largest nuclear residue and the intensity of evaporation activity serve as effective experimental proxies for event-level remnant characterization. We also evaluate photon observables essential for nuclear spectroscopy. While various photon sources overlap significantly in pseudorapidity, we find that in the nucleus-rest frame, the low-energy spectrum is dominated by de-excitation $\gamma$ rays and exhibits distinct discrete structures. These findings motivate an EIC research program that correlates rare-isotope production and de-excitation radiation with well-defined initial conditions, providing a collider-based approach to nuclear spectroscopy that is complementary to existing fixed-target facilities.</description>

      <title>3D-Deuteron Track Recoils Produced by Neutron Capture in Hydrogen Measured by MIMAC-35 cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron capture is a process that concerns most of the nuclei used to build our detectors. This process produces protons, alpha particles, and gamma rays which generate background signals. Characterizing this background is important for rare event searches, such as dark matter detection or Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS). This paper presents the result of the direct measurement of thermal neutron captures in hydrogen using a new MIcro-TPC MAtrix Chamber (MIMAC-35 cm) detector with a sensitive volume of 35 x 35 x 29 cm3. Data were collected over more than 5 days (443519 sec) with a gas mixture at 30 mbar of 70% isobutane (C4H10) and 30% trifluoromethane (CHF3). Our discrimination method is based on using 3D tracks and released ionization energy, in order to discriminate nuclear recoils (NR) from the dominant electron recoil (ER) background. This method enables the clear identification of 1.3 keV deuteron tracks resulting of nuclear capture reaction 1H(n, {\gamma})2H. We observed 51 neutron capture events among more than 11 million total events mainly produced by muons in the experimental room of our ground laboratory. In parallel we have measured the thermal neutron flux just below the chamber with a BF3 detector and a simulation has been performed to estimate the number of captures expected. This work shows the discrimination power of MIMAC search for low-energy (E &lt; 1 keV) rare event with a huge background without any shielding.</description>

      <title>RadioAxion results on the search for axion dark matter under Gran Sasso</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report first results from RadioAxion, an underground experiment searching for axion dark matter through periodic modulations of radioisotope decays. We monitor the $\alpha$ decay of $^{241}\mathrm{Am}$ via its $59.5$ keV $\gamma$ line using a NaI detector installed at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, where cosmic-ray-induced systematics are strongly suppressed. We present the measured spectra and the corresponding time-series analysis. No evidence for a periodic modulation is observed. From these data we derive constraints on the axion decay constant in the axion mass range from $10^{-21}$ to $10^{-9}$ eV.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group to link different scales. We uncover a novel transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological refinement of $p$-$d$ elastic scattering descriptions towards the 3NF study in nuclei via the ($p,pd$) reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ($p,pd$) reaction is expected to be a powerful tool for probing three-nucleon forces (3NFs) in nuclear medium since it can be essentially regarded as the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering inside nuclei. One of the important points in the theoretical description of the ($p,pd$) reaction is to calculate the $p$-$d$ scattering in a nucleus quantitatively using effective interactions. This work aims to develop a phenomenological approach to improve the quantitativity of the $p$-$d$ scattering cross section in free space calculated with effective interactions. The $p$-$d$ elastic amplitude is decomposed into a 2N part, described using 2N effective interactions, and a residual part, which the 2N part cannot describe. The latter is approximated by a superposition of Legendre polynomials, with coefficients treated as adjustable parameters. These parameters are determined to reproduce experimental $p$-$d$ differential cross-section data at various incident energies. The obtained parameters exhibit smooth energy dependence, which is approximated by quadratic functions. The numerical results with the analytic energy dependence also reproduce the experimental data. The developed approach works well for improving the $p$-$d$ scattering cross section in a wide range of incident energies. This work can be regarded as the first step toward the description of ($p,pd$) reactions taking 3NF effect in nuclear medium into account.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Spallation Induced Transmutation Rates For Long Lived Fission Products via Proton Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long lived fission products represent a major challenge in nuclear waste management due to persistent radiotoxicity over very long timescales. This study focuses on six of these fission products: Se-79, Zr-93, Tc-99, Sn-126, I-127, Cs-135. This study investigates the feasibility of spallation driven transmutation, in which a high energy proton beam strikes a heavy spallation target to generate neutrons that induce transmutation in the fission products surrounding the target. Lead and depleted uranium are identified as the principal spallation target candidates, reflecting contrasting trade offs in neutron yield, secondary reactions, and heat generation. Simulations assess nuclide specific behavior under reactor scale inventories and practical geometric constraints. Results demonstrate that technetium, iodine, and selenium are strong candidates for transmutation using this pathway, while tin shows partial resistance but benefits from thermal flux. By contrast, zirconium is neutron transparent and inefficient to transmute, and cesium suffers from low net reduction due to competition with lighter isotopes. Cost effectiveness is highly isotope dependent: technetium is most favorable, whereas cesium and zirconium remain expensive. These findings highlight the advantages and limitations of spallation driven systems and motivate strategies with optimized target-blanket designs.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation for nuclear beta decay: The effect of angular-momentum projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16313v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the effects of symmetry restoration on nuclear beta decay within the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). We employ the proton-neutron finite-amplitude method (pnFAM) to compute transition amplitudes, and perform angular-momentum projection both after variation and after the QRPA to restore rotational symmetry. Exact projection reduces the calculated beta decay half-lives from those that use the needle approximation by up to 60%, and even more when taking the effects of projection on the ground-state energy into account.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $+\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Multi-neutron correlations in light nuclei via ab-initio lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand multi-neutron systems has a long history, and recent experimental efforts aim to probe candidate four-neutron configurations in neutron-rich light nuclei such as ${}^8$He and ${}^7$H via quasi-free knockout reactions. However, the ground-state energies of the hydrogen isotopes ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H are not yet well constrained, with substantial discrepancies across experimental analyses and theoretical predictions. Using ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory with an ensemble of 282 chiral two- and three-nucleon forces, we perform a Bayesian uncertainty-quantified analysis of the ground-state energies of ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H. The marginal posteriors suggest single-neutron separation energy $S_n({}^{7}\mathrm{H})=0.35^{+0.32}_{-0.32}$ MeV, which kinematically disfavors sequential decay via ${}^{6}\mathrm{H}+n$ and thereby makes multi-neutron emission channels comparatively more relevant. Intrinsic densities indicate triton- and $\alpha$-like clusters in ${}^7$H and ${}^8$He, respectively. By computing two-body and reduced four-body correlation functions, we find that the valence neutrons in the surface region of these systems form compact dineutrons that predominantly organize into approximately symmetric dineutron-dineutron configurations, with only a small but non-negligible fraction assembling into more compact tetraneutron-like substructures. In ${}^7$H, these components account for roughly 95\% and 5\% of the sampled four-neutron configurations, respectively, and ${}^8$He exhibits a similar hierarchy. For these configurations, we also extract the corresponding spatial and angular correlation patterns among the nucleons. These results provide nuclear-structure insights into the debate surrounding four-neutron clusters and complement ongoing experimental searches for tetraneutron signatures in light nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $\gamma$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3\sigma$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$ yr and $0.66$ yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.</description>
