      <title>Floquet topological phases with time-reversal and space inversion symmetries and dynamical detection of topological charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For spinful systems with spin 1/2, it is generally believed that P and T invariant strong and second-order topologies exist in four band and eight band system, respectively. Here, by using periodic driving, we find it is possible to have strong topological insulator, second-order topological insulator and hybrid-order topological insulator in a single four band system. Furthermore, we established a direct connection between topology and dynamics. More convenient experimental detection for these topological phases has also been proposed. This study provides the theoretical basis for novel topological insulator that possess hybrid-order boundary states beyond the conventional regimes.</description>

      <title>Meandering conduction channels and the tunable nature of quantized charge transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum Hall effect founded the field of topological condensed matter physics. Its amazingly accurate quantisation of the Hall conductance, now enshrined in quantum metrology, is topologically protected: it is stable against any reasonable perturbation. Conversely, topological protection thus implies a form of censorship, as it completely hides any local information from the observer. The spatial distribution of the current in the sample is such a piece of information, which however has now become accessible thanks to spectacular experimental advances. It is an old question whether an original, and intuitively compelling, picture of the current flowing in a narrow channel along the sample edge is the physically correct one. Motivated by recent experiments $\textit{locally}$ imaging the quantized current flow in a Chern insulating (Bi, Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure, [Rosen et al., PRL 129, 246602 (2022); Ferguson et.al, Nat. Mater. 22, 1100-1105 (2023)], we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of a broad `edge state' meandering away from the sample boundary deep into the sample bulk. Further, we show that varying experimental parameters permits continuously tuning between narrow edge states and meandering channels all the way to incompressible bulk transport. This accounts for various features observed in, and differing between, experiments. Overall, this underscores the robustness of topological condensed matter physics, but it also unveils a phenomenological richness hidden by topological censorship -- much of which we believe remains to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Interacting holes in a gated WSe$_2$ quantum channel: valley correlations and zigzag Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of interacting valence holes in a gate-defined one-dimensional quantum channel in a single layer of a transition metal dichalcogenide material WSe$_2$. Based on a microscopic atomistic tight-binding model and Hartree-Fock and exact configuration-interaction tools we demonstrate the possibility of symmetry-broken valley polarized states for strongly interacting holes. The interplay between interactions, perpendicular magnetic field, and the lateral confinement asymmetry together with the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling present in WSe$_2$ material is analyzed, and its impact on valley polarization is discussed. For weaker interactions, an investigation of the pair correlation function reveals a valley-antiferromagnetic phase. For low hole densities, a formation of a zigzag Wigner crystal phase is predicted. The impact of various hole liquid phases on transport in a high mobility quasi-one dimensional channel is discussed.</description>

      <title>Structure Phase Change Induced by Nonequilibrium Effects in Molecular Scale Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interrelationship between a material's structure and its properties lies at the heart of materials-related research. Finding how the changes of one affect the other is of primary importance in theoretical and computational materials studies. In this work, based on Hershfield nonequilibrium quantum statistics and the mean-field approach with steady-state density functional theory, we derive a first-principles method to calculate nonequilibrium effects induced forces acting on atoms, enabling structure optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations for molecular junctions under external biases. By applying the method to a few molecular devices, we found that in general, the external bias can induce profound nonequilibrium effects on both electronic/transport properties and the geometric structure of these devices, and consequent changes in electronic properties and geometric structure are closely interrelated. Particularly, when the bias voltage is above 1.0 V, significant structure phase changes could occur, causing dramatic changes in I-V characteristics and vibrational spectra. These findings greatly broaden our understanding of quantum electronic devices and provide a new avenue for discovering novel transport phenomena at molecular scale.</description>

      <title>Link between cascade transitions and correlated Chern insulators in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern insulators are topologically non-trivial states of matter characterized by incompressible bulk and chiral edge states. Incorporating topological Chern bands with strong electronic correlations provides a versatile playground for studying emergent quantum phenomena. In this study, we resolve the correlated Chern insulators (CCIs) in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) through Rydberg exciton sensing spectroscopy, and unveil their direct link with the zero-field cascade features in the electronic compressibility. The compressibility minima in the cascade are found to deviate substantially from nearby integer fillings (by $\Delta\nu$) and coincide with the onsets of CCIs in doping densities, yielding a quasi-universal relation $B_c$=$\Phi_0\Delta\nu/C$ (onset magnetic field $B_c$, magnetic flux quantum $\Phi_0$ and Chern number $C$). We suggest these onsets lie on the intersection where the integer filling of localized "f-orbitals" and Chern bands are simultaneously reached. Our findings update the field-dependent phase diagram of MATBG and directly support the topological heavy fermion model.</description>

      <title>Electric field controlled valley-polarized photocurrent switch based on the circular bulk photovoltaic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient electric manipulation of valley degrees of freedom is critical and challenging for the advancement of valley-based information science and technology. We put forth an electrical scheme, based on a two-band Dirac model, that can switch the fully valley-polarized photocurrent between K and K' valleys using the circular bulk electro-photovoltaic effect. This is accomplished by applying an out-of-plane electric field to the two-dimensional valley materials, which enables continuous tuning of the Berry curvature and its sign flip. We found that the switch of the fully valley-polarized photocurrent is directly tied to the sign change of Berry curvature, which accompanies a topological phase transition, for instance, the quantum spin Hall effect and the quantum valley Hall effect. This scheme has been confirmed in monolayer BiAsI_2 and germanene through first-principles calculations. Our paper offers a promising strategy for the development of a volatile valley-addressable memory device and could inspire further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Topological Corner States in Bilayer and Trilayer Systems with Vertically Stacked Topologically Distinct Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bilayer and trilayer systems composed of topologically distinct, vertically stacked layers based on the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We have identified a topological phase transition that significantly alters the number of the topological corner states in these systems. Additionally, we find that traditional nested Wilson loop analysis inaccurately classifies certain phases, leading us to evaluate multipole chiral numbers (MCNs) as a more appropriate topological invariant. This approach accurately identifies topological phases and the number of MCNs coincides with the number of corner modes, enhancing our understanding of topological insulators and opening avenues for further applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of potential and temperature fluctuations on charge and heat transport in quantum Hall edges in the heat Coulomb blockade regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broad study of charge and heat transport in a mesoscopic system where one or several quantum Hall edge channels are strongly coupled to a floating Ohmic contact (OC). It is well known that charge-current fluctuations emanating from the OC along the edge channels are highly susceptible to the OC charge capacitance in the heat Coulomb blockade regime (an impeded ability of the OC to equilibrate edge channels). Here, we demonstrate how potential- and temperature fluctuations due to finite OC charge and heat capacities impact the heat-current fluctuations emitted from the OC. First, by assuming an infinite OC heat capacity, we show that the output heat-current noise is strongly dependent on the OC charge capacitance, following from a close relation between one-dimensional charge- and heat currents. When also the OC heat capacity is finite, an interplay of potential- and temperature fluctuations influences the heat transport. Concretely, we find that the effect of the charge capacitance on heat transport manifests in terms of a strongly increased energy relaxation time in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. Furthermore, we find expressions for a broad set of output observables, such as charge and heat auto- and cross correlations, as functions of input and OC fluctuations, depending on the relation between charge and energy relaxation times compared to the frequency of fluctuations and inverse (local) temperatures as well as on the number of edge channels attached to the OC. Finally, we show that a finite OC heat capacity transforms the full counting statistics of the output charge from Gaussian to non-Gaussian. Our findings provide novel opportunities to experimentally probe and harness the quantum nature of heat transport in strongly coupled electron circuits.</description>

      <title>Signature of non-trivial band topology in Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) magneto-oscillations in the resistivity of two-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Within the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for TIs in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field, we obtain analytical expressions for the SdH oscillations by combining a semiclassical approach for the resistivity and a trace formula for the density of states. We show that when the non-trivial topology is produced by inverted bands with ''Mexican-hat'' shape, SdH oscillations show an anomalous beating pattern that is {\it solely} due to the non-trivial topology of the system. These beatings are robust against, and distinct from beatings originating from spin-orbit interactions. This provides a direct way to experimentally probe the non-trivial topology of 2D TIs entirely from a bulk measurement. Furthermore, the Fourier transform of the SdH oscillations as a function of the Fermi energy and quantum capacitance models allows for extracting both the topological gap and gap at zero momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new fluxonium qubit design, gatemonium, based on an all superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platform exhibiting gate voltage tunability of $E_J$. We first show the principle of fluxonium operation in epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructure where the single Josephson junction can be controlled using gate voltage control, effectively tuning the ``weight'' of the fictitious phase particle. The spectroscopy of the qubit shows tunability between plasmons to fluxons and their hybrid spectrum. We study two gatemonium devices with different charging energies and extract inductance of InAs-based Josephson junctions array. We also discuss future directions implementing a gate voltage tunable superinductance.</description>

      <title>Stimulated magnon scattering by non-degenerate parametric excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric spin wave excitation allows studying a variety of nonlinear phenomena, such as magnon scattering. In patterned micro- and nanostructures the magnon spectra is discrete and translational symmetry is broken, which means allowable scattering channels differ from those in continuous films. An example is non-degenerate scattering by which high-power transverse field pumping creates two magnons with distinct frequencies around half the pumping frequency. Through micromagnetics simulations, we show under certain conditions that combining two pumping frequencies generates new magnon modes through a process of stimulated magnon scattering. Such processes are found to depend on the film geometry and sequence of the pumping fields.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of a nodal line semimetal candidate TbSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LnSbTe (Ln = Lanthanides) family, like isostructural ZrSiS type compounds, has emerged as a fertile playground for exploring the interaction of electronic correlations and magnetic ordering with the nodal line band topology. Here, we report a detailed electronic band structure investigation of TbSbTe, corroborated by electrical transport, thermodynamic, and magnetic studies. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility and thermodynamic transport studies indicate the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 5.1 K. The electronic band structure study, carried out with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements aided with density functional theory based first-principles calculations reveals presence of nodal lines in the GammaX high symmetry direction, forming a diamond-shaped nodal plane around Gamma high symmetry point. A strongly photon energy dependent nodal feature located at the X point of the surface Brillouin zone, indicating an extended nodal line along X R direction, is also observed. This study elucidates the intricate interplay among symmetry-protected band characteristics, the influence of spin orbit coupling, magnetism, and topological properties.</description>

      <title>Entanglement properties of optomagnonic crystal from nonlinear perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomagnonics is a new field of research in condensed matter physics and quantum optics focused on strong magnon-photon interactions. Particular interest concerns realistic, experimentally feasible materials and prototype cheap elements for futuristic nanodevices implemented in the processing or storing of quantum information. Quantifying the entanglement between two continuous bosonic modes, such as magnons and photons, is not trivial. The state-of-the-art for today is the logarithmic negativity, calculated through the quantum Langevin equations subjected to thermal noise. However, due to its complexity, this method requires further approximation. In the present work, we propose a new procedure that avoids the linearization of dynamics. Prior analyzing the quantum entanglement, we explore the nonlinear semiclassical dynamics in detail and precisely define the phase space. The typical nonlinear dynamical system holds bifurcation points and fixed points of different characters in its phase space. Our main finding is that entanglement is not defined in the Saddle Point region. On the other hand, the maximum of the entanglement corresponds to the region near the border between the Stable node and Stable spiral regions. In numerical calculations, we considered a particular system: optomagnonic crystal based on the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) slab with the periodic air holes drilled in the slab. In our case, Magnon-photon interaction occurs due to the magneto-electric effect in YIG. We provide explicit derivation of the coupling term. Besides, we calculate photon modes for a particular geometry of the optomagnonic crystal. We analyzed the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the optomagnonic crystal and showed that due to the instability region, one could efficiently switch the mean magnon numbers in the system and control entanglement in the system.</description>

      <title>Solving the Synthetic Riddle of Colloidal 2D PbTe Nanoplatelets with Tunable Near-Infrared Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared emitting colloidal two-dimensional (2D) PbX (X=S, Se) nanoplatelets have emerged as interesting materials with strong size quantisation in the thickness dimension. They act as model systems for efficient charge carrier multiplication and hold potential as intriguing candidates for finer-based photonic quantum applications. However, synthetic access to the third family member, 2D PbTe, remains elusive due to a challenging precursor chemistry. Here, we report a direct synthesis for 2D PbTe nanoplatelets (NPLs) with unable photoluminescence (PL, 910-1460 nm (1.36-0.85 eV), PLQY 1-15 %), based on aminophosphine precursor chemistry. Ex-situ transamination of tris(dimethylamino)phosphine telluride with octylamine is confirmed by 31P NMR and yields a reactive tellurium precursor for the formation of 2D PbTe NPLs at temperatures as low as 0 {\deg}C. The PL position of the PbTe NPLs is unable by controlling the Pb:Te ration in the reaction. GIWAXS confirms the 2D geometry of the NPLs and the formation of superlattices. The importance of a post-synthetic passivation of the PbTe NPLs by PbI2 to ensure colloidal stability of the otherwise oxygen sensitive samples is supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Our results expand and complete the row of lead chalcogenide-based 2D NPLs, opening up new ways for further pushing the optical properties of 2D NPLs into the infrared and toward technologically relevant wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Cascade of multi-exciton states generated by singlet fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying multi-exciton states generated from singlet fission is key to understanding the carrier multiplication process, which presents a strategy for improving the efficiency of photovoltaics and bio-imaging. Broadband optically detected magnetic resonance is a sensitive technique to detect multi-exciton states. Here we report a dominant species emerging under intense light excitation corresponding to a weakly exchange coupled triplet pair located on adjacent molecules oriented by nearly 90 degrees, contrasting to the pi-stacked triplet pair under low excitation intensity. The weakly coupled species model precisely reproduces the intricate spin transitions in the Hilbert space of the triplet pair. Combining the magneto photoluminescence and high-magnetic field ODMR, we also identify a strongly exchange-coupled state of three triplet excitons formed by photoexcited V2, which manifests through the magnetic field induced level crossings between its quintet and triplet manifolds. The excellent agreement between the experimental Zeeman fan and the two-triplet spin Hamiltonian highlights the potential of multi-exciton states for quantum information processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic axion insulators feature a time-dependent axion field that can be induced by antiferromagnetic resonance. Here, we show that a Josephson junction incorporating this dynamic axion insulator between two superconductors exhibits a striking doubled Shapiro steps wherein all odd steps are completely suppressed in the jointly presence of a DC bias and a static magnetic field. The resistively shunted junction simulation confirms that these doubled Shapiro steps originate from the distinctive axion electrodynamics driven by the antiferromagnetic resonance, which thus not only furnishes a hallmark to identify the dynamic axion insulator but also provides a method to evaluate its mass term. Furthermore, the experimentally feasible differential conductance is also determined. Our work holds significant importance in condensed matter physics and materials science for understanding the dynamic axion insulator, paving the way for its further exploration and applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal magnetization switching via spin-orbit torque on the surface of a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal protocol for the current-induced switching of a perpendicularly magnetized nanoelement placed on the surface of a topological insulator is presented. The time dependence of both in-plane components of the surface current that induces the magnetization reversal via Dirac spin-orbit torque with minimal Joule heating is derived analytically as a function of the required switching time and material properties. It is demonstrated that a particularly energy-efficient switching is realized for vanishing dampinglike torque. The optimal reversal time providing a tradeoff between the switching speed and energy efficiency is derived. The obtained switching protocol is contrasted with the one realized in heavy-metal systems. Topological insulators provide a highly tunable platform for the realization of energy-efficient magnetization switching.</description>

      <title>Magnon spin transport through atomic ferrimagnetic domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well-established notion that the spin of a magnon should be flipped when it passes through a $180^{\circ}$ domain wall (DW) in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, while the magnon spin transport through ferrimagnetic DW is still elusive. In this work, we report that the magnon preserves its spin after the transmission through an atomically sharp DW in ferrimagnets, due to the intriguing interband magnon scattering at the domain interface. This finding may provide significant insight to resolve the puzzling insensitivity of magnon spin diffusion to the $180^{\circ}$ ferrimagnetic DWs observed by recent experiments. Our results reveal the unique role of ferrimagnetic DWs in manipulating the magnon spin and may facilitate the design of novel magnonic devices based on ferrimagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze electronic excitations (excitations generated by adding or removing one electron) in the bulk of fractional quantum Hall states in Jain sequence states, using composite fermion Chern-Simons field theory. Starting from meanfield approximation in which gauge field fluctuations are neglected, we use symmetry to constrain the possible composite fermion states contributing to electronic Green's function and expect discrete infinitely-sharp peaks in the electronic spectral function. We further consider the electronic excitations in particle-hole conjugate fractional quantum hall states. Gauge field fluctuations play an increasingly important role in the electron spectral function as the filling factor approaches 1/2, and evolve the discrete coherent peaks into a broad continuum even in the absence of impurities. At that limit, we switch to the electron perspective and calculate the electron spectral function via linked cluster approximation from the low to intermediate energy range. Finally, we compare our results with recent experiments.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moir\'e-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.</description>

      <title>Realization of topological Thouless pumping in a synthetic Rydberg dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of synthetic dimensions by manipulating internal states of atoms and molecules has opened the door to investigate regimes outside those of more traditional quantum many-body platforms. Highly excited Rydberg states of atoms are a particularly promising platform to engineer Hamiltonians in such synthetic dimensions due to their large number of addressable states and the readily available technologies for manipulating their couplings and for detecting them. In this letter, we demonstrate the realization of topological quantum pumping in synthetic dimensions by engineering a one-dimensional Rice-Mele chain from the Rydberg states of cesium atoms, and manipulating their couplings in a time-dependent fashion through radio-frequency fields. We implement Thouless protocols for topological pumping and investigate the efficiency for pumping an effective quantum particle as a function of the period of pumping and other parameters while allowing for rates of change that are not necessarily adiabatic. We demonstrate that optimal pumping efficiencies of up to 90% can be achieved when the pump is operated in the topological Thouless regime, even when the pumping is accompanied by the wave-packet spread that arises from the energy dispersion of the particle along the synthetic dimension.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Russian Doll Model (RDM) of superconductivity for finite energy levels. Previously, cyclic renormalization group (RG) and Efimov scaling were found in RDM for part of the equidistant spectrum and we generalize this observation in a few directions. We find that when the whole spectrum is considered, equidistancy condition is removed or diagonal disorder is added, the cyclicity of RG survives but the period of RG becomes energy dependent. The analytic analysis is supported with exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Quantitative determination of twist angle and strain in Van der Waals moir\'e superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe techniques are popular, non-destructive ways to visualize the real space structure of Van der Waals moir\'es. The high lateral spatial resolution provided by these techniques enables extracting the moir\'e lattice vectors from a scanning probe image. We have found that the extracted values, while precise, are not necessarily accurate. Scan-to-scan variations in the behavior of the piezos which drive the scanning probe, and thermally-driven slow relative drift between probe and sample, produce systematic errors in the extraction of lattice vectors. In this Letter, we identify the errors and provide a protocol to correct for them. Applying this protocol to an ensemble of ten successive scans of near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, we are able to reduce our errors in extracting lattice vectors to less than 1%. This translates to extracting twist angles with a statistical uncertainty less than 0.001{\deg} and uniaxial heterostrain with uncertainty on the order of 0.002%.</description>

      <title>Topological pairing of composite fermions via criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical oscillators stand out as high-performance and versatile candidates for serving as reference clocks in sequential photonic integrated circuits. Indeed, they have the unique capability of simultaneously generating mechanical tones and optical signal modulations at frequencies determined by their geometrical design. In this context, the concept of synchronization introduces a powerful means to precisely coordinate the dynamics of multiple oscillators in a controlled manner, thus increasing efficiency and preventing errors in signal processing photonic systems or communication interfaces. In this work, we demonstrate the cascaded injection locking of a pair of silicon-based optomechanical crystal cavities to an external reference signal that subtly modulates the laser driving one of the oscillators. Both cavities interact solely through a weak mechanical link, making the extension of this synchronization mechanism to an increased number of optomechanical oscillators within a common chip more feasible than relying solely on optical interactions. Thus, the combination of the obtained results, supported by a numerical model, with remote optical injection locking schemes discussed in the literature, lays the groundwork for the distribution of reference signals within large networks of processing elements in future phonon-photon hybrid circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains can be used to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs) in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this work, we realize a two-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electrongas by coupling two quantum dots through a region proximitized by a superconductor. We demonstrate systematic control over inter-dot couplings through in-plane rotations of the magnetic field and via electrostatic gating of the proximitized region. This allows us to tune the system to sweet spots in parameter space, where robust correlated zero bias conductance peaks are observed in tunnelling spectroscopy. To study the extent of hybridization between localized MBSs, we probe the evolution of the energy spectrum with magnetic field and estimate the Majorana polarization, an important metric for Majorana-based qubits. The implementation of a Kitaev chain on a scalable and flexible 2D platform provides a realistic path towards more advanced experiments that require manipulation and readout of multiple MBSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the amount of backscattering of Valley Hall modes in a classical topological insulator. In reciprocal systems, the conservation of the valley index has been argued to be at the root of the high-transmission of Valley Hall modes, observed in many experimental realisations. Here, we reconsider this hypothesis by quantitatively analysing the canonical scattering problem of interface Valley Hall modes impinging on sharp bends which may or may not conserve the valley index. We consider a tight binding model of graphene ribbons with an interface and compute the reflection and transmission coefficients using a transfer matrix formalism. We find that, in all configurations considered, the transmission of Valley Hall modes is close to being maximal, even in cases where the valley index is not conserved. Hence there appears to be no correlation between valley conservation and good transmission. Our results serve as a reference case for the design of Valley Hall type metamaterial.</description>

Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of graphene nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surfaces, within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when Dirac-like 1D modes appear in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, at growing impurity concentration $c$, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and even opening, at yet higher $c$, of some narrow delocalized range within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with the similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene and armchair type graphene nanoribbons. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient approach for the computation of energy eigenvalues in quantum semiconductor heterostructures. Accurate determination of the electronic states in these heterostructures is crucial for understanding their optical and electronic properties, making it a key challenge in semiconductor physics. The proposed method is based on utilizing series expansions of zero-order Bessel functions to numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation using boundary integral method for bound electron states in a computationally efficient manner. To validate the proposed technique, we applied it to address previously explored issues by other research groups. The results clearly demonstrate the computational efficiency and high precision of our approach. Notably, the proposed technique significantly reduces the computational time compared to the conventional method for searching the energy eigenvalues in quantum structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.02382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient, scalable, and deterministic scheme to generate multiple indistinguishable photons over independent channels, on demand. Our design relies on multiple single-photon sources, each coupled to a waveguide, and all of them interact with a common cavity mode. The cavity synchronizes and triggers the simultaneous emission of one photon by each source, which are collected by the waveguides. For a state-of-the-art circuit QED implementation, this scheme supports the creation of single photons with purity, indistinguishability, and efficiency of $99\%$ at rates of $\sim $MHz. We also discuss conditions to produce up to 100 photons simultaneously with generation rates of hundreds of kHz. This is orders of magnitude more efficient than previous demultiplexed sources for boson sampling and enables the realization of deterministic multi-photon sources and scalable quantum information processing with photons.</description>

Abstract: For decades, frustrated quantum magnets have been a seed for scientific progress and innovation in condensed matter. As much as the numerical tools for low-dimensional quantum magnetism have thrived and improved in recent years due to breakthroughs inspired by quantum information and quantum computation, higher-dimensional quantum magnetism can be considered as the final frontier, where strong quantum entanglement, multiple ordering channels, and manifold ways of paramagnetism culminate. At the same time, efforts in crystal synthesis have induced a significant increase in the number of tangible frustrated magnets which are generically three-dimensional in nature, creating an urgent need for quantitative theoretical modeling. We review the pseudo-fermion (PF) and pseudo-Majorana (PM) functional renormalization group (FRG) and their specific ability to address higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnetism. First developed more than a decade ago, the PFFRG interprets a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian in terms of Abrikosov pseudofermions, which is then treated in a diagrammatic resummation scheme formulated as a renormalization group flow of $m$-particle pseudofermion vertices. The article reviews the state of the art of PFFRG and PMFRG and discusses their application to exemplary domains of frustrated magnetism, but most importantly, it makes the algorithmic and implementation details of these methods accessible to everyone. By thus lowering the entry barrier to their application, we hope that this review will contribute towards establishing PFFRG and PMFRG as the numerical methods for addressing frustrated quantum magnetism in higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Elasticity-Controlled Jamming Criticality in Soft Composite Solids</title>

Abstract: Soft composite solids are made of inclusions dispersed within soft matrices. They are ubiquitous in nature and form the basis of many biological tissues. In the field of materials science, synthetic soft composites are promising candidates for building various engineering devices due to their highly programmable features. However, when the volume fraction of the inclusions increases, predicting the mechanical properties of these materials poses a significant challenge for the classical theories of composite mechanics. The difficulty arises from the inherently disordered, multi-scale interactions between the inclusions and the matrix. To address this challenge, we systematically investigated the mechanics of densely filled soft elastomers containing stiff microspheres. We experimentally demonstrated how the strain-stiffening response of the soft composites is governed by the critical scalings in the vicinity of a shear-jamming transition of the included particles. The proposed criticality framework quantitatively connects the overall mechanics of a soft composite with the elasticity of the matrix and the particles, and captures the diverse mechanical responses observed across a wide range of material parameters. The findings uncover a novel design paradigm of composite mechanics that relies on engineering the jamming properties of the embedded inclusions.</description>

      <title>BerryEasy: A GPU enabled python package for diagnosis of nth-order and spin-resolved topology in the presence of fields and effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple software packages currently exist for the computation of bulk topological invariants in both idealized tight-binding models and realistic Wannier tight-binding models derived from density functional theory. Currently, only one package, PythTB(https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/) is capable of computing nested Wilson loops and spin-resolved Wilson loops. These state-of-the-art techniques are vital for accurate analysis of band topology. In this paper we introduce BerryEasy, a python package which is built to work alongside the PyBinding(https://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/index.html) software package. By working in tandem with the Pybinding package and harnessing the speed of graphical processing units, topological analysis of supercells in the presence of disorder and impurities is made possible. The BerryEasy package simultaneously accommodates use of realistic tight-binding models developed using Wannier90.</description>

      <title>Quantum-fluctuation asymmetry in multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13597</link>

Abstract: We explore the statistical behavior of the light emanating from a coherently driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) oscillator operating in the regime of multiphoton blockade with two monitored output channels causing the loss of coherence at equal rates. We do so by adopting an operational approach which draws the particle and wave aspects of the forwards scattered radiation together, building upon the relationship between quantum optical correlation functions and conditional measurements. We first derive an analytical expression of the intensity cross-correlation function at the peak of the two-photon JC resonance to demonstrate the breakdown of detailed balance. The application of quantum trajectory theory in parallel with the quantum regression formula subsequently uncovers various aspects of temporal asymmetry in the quantum fluctuations characterizing the cascaded process through which a multiphoton resonance is established and read out. We find that monitoring different quadratures of the cavity field in conditional homodyne detection affects the times waited between successive photon counter ``clicks'', which in turn trigger the sampling of the homodyne current. Despite the fact that the steady-state cavity occupation is of the order of a photon, monitoring of the developing bimodality also impacts on the ratio between the emissions directed along the two decoherence channels.</description>
