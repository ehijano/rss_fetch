      <title>Optimal Betting: Beyond the Long-Term Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Kelly portfolio has many desirable properties, including optimal long-term growth rate, the resulting investment strategy is rather aggressive. In this paper, we suggest a unified approach to the risk assessment of the Kelly criterion in both discrete and continuous time by introducing and analyzing the asymptotic variance that describes fluctuations of the portfolio growth, and use the results to propose two new measures for quantifying risk.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the power of text for credit default prediction: Comparing human-written and generative AI-refined texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of a representative large language model, ChatGPT, into lending decision-making with a focus on credit default prediction. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to analyse and interpret loan assessments written by loan officers and generate refined versions of these texts. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences between generative artificial intelligence (AI)-refined and human-written texts in terms of text length, semantic similarity, and linguistic representations. Using deep learning techniques, we show that incorporating unstructured text data, particularly ChatGPT-refined texts, alongside conventional structured data significantly enhances credit default predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the contents of both human-written and ChatGPT-refined assessments contribute to the models' prediction and show that the effect of essential words is highly context-dependent. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT's analysis of borrower delinquency contributes the most to improving predictive accuracy. We also evaluate the business impact of the models based on human-written and ChatGPT-refined texts, and find that, in most cases, the latter yields higher profitability than the former. This study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of generative AI in financial services.</description>

      <title>A Curationary Tale: Logarithmic Regret in DeFi Lending via Dynamic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lending within decentralized finance (DeFi) has facilitated over $100 billion of loans since 2020. A long-standing inefficiency in DeFi lending protocols such as Aave is the use of static pricing mechanisms for loans. These mechanisms have been shown to maximize neither welfare nor revenue for participants in DeFi lending protocols. Recently, adaptive supply models pioneered by Morpho and Euler have become a popular means of dynamic pricing for loans. This pricing is facilitated by agents known as curators, who bid to match supply and demand. We construct and analyze an online learning model for static and dynamic pricing models within DeFi lending. We show that when loans are small and have a short duration relative to an observation time $T$, adaptive supply models achieve $O(\log T)$ regret, while static models cannot achieve better than $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We then study competitive behavior between curators, demonstrating that adaptive supply mechanisms maximize revenue and welfare for both borrowers and lenders.</description>

      <title>Credit Risk Meets Large Language Models: Building a Risk Indicator from Loan Descriptions in P2P Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending connects borrowers and lenders through online platforms but suffers from significant information asymmetry, as lenders often lack sufficient data to assess borrowers' creditworthiness. This paper addresses this challenge by leveraging BERT, a Large Language Model (LLM) known for its ability to capture contextual nuances in text, to generate a risk score based on borrowers' loan descriptions using a dataset from the Lending Club platform. We fine-tune BERT to distinguish between defaulted and non-defaulted loans using the loan descriptions provided by the borrowers. The resulting BERT-generated risk score is then integrated as an additional feature into an XGBoost classifier used at the loan granting stage, where decision-makers have limited information available to guide their decisions. This integration enhances predictive performance, with improvements in balanced accuracy and AUC, highlighting the value of textual features in complementing traditional inputs. Moreover, we find that the incorporation of the BERT score alters how classification models utilize traditional input variables, with these changes varying by loan purpose. These findings suggest that BERT discerns meaningful patterns in loan descriptions, encompassing borrower-specific features, specific purposes, and linguistic characteristics. However, the inherent opacity of LLMs and their potential biases underscore the need for transparent frameworks to ensure regulatory compliance and foster trust. Overall, this study demonstrates how LLM-derived insights interact with traditional features in credit risk modeling, opening new avenues to enhance the explainability and fairness of these models.</description>

      <title>Set risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of set risk measures (SRMs), which are real-valued maps defined on the space of all non-empty, closed, and bounded sets of almost surely bounded random variables. Traditional risk measures typically operate on spaces of random variables, but SRMs extend this framework to sets of random variables. We establish an axiom scheme for SRMs, similar to classical risk measures but adapted for set operations. The main technical contribution is an axiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs by using regular, finitely additive measures on the unit ball of the dual space of essentially bounded random variables. We explore worst-case SRMs, which evaluate risk as the supremum of individual risks within a set, and provide a collection of examples illustrating the applicability of our framework to systemic risk, portfolio optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty. This work extends the theory of risk measures to a more general and flexible setup, accommodating a broader range of financial and mathematical applications.</description>
