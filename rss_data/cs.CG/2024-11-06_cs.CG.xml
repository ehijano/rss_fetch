      <title>Approximation Algorithms for the Freeze Tag Problem inside Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The freeze tag problem (FTP) aims to awaken a swarm of robots with one or more initial awake robots as soon as possible. Each awake robot must touch a sleeping robot to wake it up. Once a robot is awakened, it can assist in awakening other sleeping robots. We study this problem inside a polygonal domain and present approximation algorithms for it.</description>

      <title>Geometry of naturalistic object representations in recurrent neural network models of working memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent decision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working memory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than ecologically relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies have primarily investigated working memory during single or few cognitive tasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is maintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained them on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the RNN's latent space, we found that: (1) Multi-task RNNs represent both task-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks; (2) The latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla RNNs are largely shared across tasks, but highly task-specific in gated RNNs such as GRU and LSTM; (3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new representational spaces in which individual object features are less orthogonalized relative to the perceptual space; (4) The transformation of working memory encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent space) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing the retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were distinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ chronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans, enabling testable predictions with neural data.</description>

      <title>Top-k Stabbing Interval Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a weighted variant of the interval stabbing problem, where the goal is to design an efficient data structure for a given set $\mathcal{I}$ of weighted intervals such that, for a query point $q$ and an integer $k&gt;0$, we can report the $k$ intervals with largest weights among those stabbed by $q$. In this paper, we present a linear space solution with $O(\log n + k)$ query time. Moreover, we also present another trade-off for the problem.</description>

      <title>Surface Reconstruction Using Rotation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the seminal result that a graph and an associated rotation system uniquely determine the topology of a closed manifold, we propose a combinatorial method for reconstruction of surfaces from points. Our method constructs a spanning tree and a rotation system. Since the tree is trivially a planar graph, its rotation system determines a genus zero surface with a single face which we proceed to incrementally refine by inserting edges to split faces and thus merging them. In order to raise the genus, special handles are added by inserting edges between different faces and thus merging them. We apply our method to a wide range of input point clouds in order to investigate its effectiveness, and we compare our method to several other surface reconstruction methods. We find that our method offers better control over outlier classification, i.e. which points to include in the reconstructed surface, and also more control over the topology of the reconstructed surface.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Fast and Correct Computation of Reeb Spaces for PL Bivariate Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reeb space is an important tool (data-structure) for topological data analysis that captures the quotient space topology of a multi-field or multiple scalar fields. For piecewise-linear (PL) bivariate fields, the Reeb spaces are $2$-dimensional polyhedrons while for PL scalar fields, the Reeb graphs (or Reeb spaces) are of dimension $1$. Efficient algorithms have been designed for computing Reeb graphs, however, computing correct Reeb spaces for PL bivariate fields, is a challenging open problem. In the current paper, we propose a novel algorithm for fast and correct computation of the Reeb space corresponding to a generic PL bivariate field defined on a triangulation $\mathbb{M}$ of a $3$-manifold without boundary, leveraging the fast algorithms for computing Reeb graphs in the literature.
  Our algorithm is based on the computation of a Multi-Dimensional Reeb Graph (MDRG) which is first proved to be homeomorphic with the Reeb space. For the correct computation of the MDRG, we compute the Jacobi set of the PL bivariate field and its projection into the Reeb space, called the Jacobi structure. Finally, the correct Reeb space is obtained by computing a net-like structure embedded in the Reeb space and then computing its $2$-sheets in the net-like structure. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^2 + n(c_{int})\log (n) + nc_L^2)$, where $n$ is the total number of simplices in $\mathbb{M}$, $c_{int}$ is the number of intersections of the projections of the non-adjacent Jacobi set edges on the range of the bivariate field and $c_L$ is the upper bound on the number of simplices in the link of an edge of $\mathbb{M}$. This complexity is comparable with the fastest algorithm available in the literature. Moreover, we claim to provide the first algorithm to compute the topologically correct Reeb space without using range quantization.</description>
