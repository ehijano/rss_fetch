      <title>Precision-Graded Cohomology and Arithmetic Persistence for Network Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology tracks topological features across geometric scales, encoding birth and death of cycles as barcodes. We develop a complementary theory where the filtration parameter is algebraic precision rather than geometric scale. Working over the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$, we define \emph{arithmetic barcodes} that measure torsion in network sheaf cohomology: each bar records the precision threshold at which a cohomology class fails to lift through the valuation filtration $\mathbb{Z}_p \supseteq p\mathbb{Z}_p \supseteq p^2\mathbb{Z}_p \supseteq \cdots$.
  Our central result -- the \emph{Digit-SNF Dictionary} -- establishes that hierarchical precision data from connecting homomorphisms between successive mod-$p^k$ cohomology levels encodes exactly the Smith normal form exponents of the coboundary operator. Bars of length $a$ correspond to $\mathbb{Z}_p/p^a\mathbb{Z}_p$ torsion summands. For rank-one sheaves, cycle holonomy (the product of edge scalings around loops) determines bar lengths explicitly via $p$-adic valuation, and threshold stability guarantees barcode invariance when perturbations respect precision. Smith normal form provides integral idempotents projecting onto canonical cohomology representatives without geometric structure.
  Results extend to arbitrary discrete valuation rings, with $p$-adic topology providing ultrametric geometry when available. Applications include distributed consensus protocols with quantized communication, sensor network synchronization, and systems where measurement precision creates natural hierarchical structure. The framework repositions torsion from computational obstacle to primary signal in settings where data stratifies by precision.</description>

      <title>Prismatization via spherical loop spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Frobenius-untwists of the variants of topological cyclic homology, following Manam. Using these, we construct modifications of the free loop space over the sphere spectrum, and show that they provide even periodic spectral enhancements of the prismatization stacks of Bhatt-Lurie and Drinfeld. We identify the extra structure on prismatization encoded in the even periodic enhancements with previously-known structures, such as the Breuil-Kisin twists and the Drinfeld formal group.</description>

      <title>Sketchable infinity categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sketch is a category equipped with specified collections of cones and cocones. Its models are functors to the category of sets that send the distinguished cones and cocones to limit cones and colimit cocones, respectively. Sketches provide a categorical formalization of theories, interpreting logical operations in terms of limits and colimits. Gabriel and Ulmer showed that categories of models of sketches involving only cones (called limit sketches) are precisely the locally presentable categories, while Lair extended this correspondence to sketches including both cones and cocones, thereby characterizing accessible categories.
  In this article, we discuss a homotopy-coherent generalization of sketches in the context of $\infty$-categories and prove that presentable $\infty$-categories are the $\infty$-categories of models of limit sketches, whereas accessible $\infty$-categories arise as the $\infty$-categories of models of arbitrary sketches. As illustrations, we make the corresponding sketches explicit for a wide range of $\infty$-categories, including complete Segal spaces, $\infty$-operads, $A_\infty$-algebras, $E_\infty$-algebras, spectra, and higher sheaves.</description>

      <title>On torsion of non-acyclic cellular chain complexes of even manifolds in a unique factorisation monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{2n}^{\mathrm{Diff},\mathrm{hc}}$ be a multiplicative factorisation monoid over highly connected differentiable closed connected oriented manifolds. Any $2n$-dimensional manifold $W_p^{2n}$ from $\mathcal{M}_{2n}^{\mathrm{Diff},\mathrm{hc}}$ admits a unique connected sum decomposition into manifolds that cannot be decomposed any further. By using this decomposition, we prove that Reidemeister-Franz torsion of $W_p^{2n}$ can be written as the product of Reidemeister-Franz torsions of the manifolds in the decomposition without the corrective term.</description>

      <title>On the summation and triangulation independence of Lorentzian spinfoam amplitudes for all LQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental issue of triangulation dependence in spinfoam quantum gravity. It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam stack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of 2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of faces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing the amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area of internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an integral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold. This manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the underlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics from a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF theory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a powerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a triangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends only on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result that is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This provides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined limit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of quantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld associators and Kashiwara-Vergne associators in higher genera</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $g\geq 0$, a genus $g$ Kashiwara-Vergne associator, introduced by Alekseev-Kawazumi-Kuno-Naef as a solution to the generalised KV equations in relation to the formality problem of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra on an oriented surface with a framing, is directly constructed from a genus $g$ analogue of a Drinfeld associator formulated by Gonzalez, which we call a Gonzalez-Drinfeld associator. The proof is based on Massuyeau's work in genus 0. The framing is automatically determined from the choice of a Gonzalez-Drinfeld associator, and in the case of genus 1, we show that only one particular framing is realised by our construction.</description>

      <title>Persistence-Based Statistics for Detecting Structural Changes in High-Dimensional Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic behavior of persistence statistics under distributional variability and propose a novel nonparametric framework for detecting structural changes in high-dimensional random point clouds. We first establish moment bounds and tightness results for classical persistence statistics - total and maximum persistence - under general distributions, with explicit scaling behavior derived for Gaussian mixture models. Building on these theoretical foundations, we introduce a normalized statistic based on persistence landscapes combined with the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and we prove its Holder continuity with respect to perturbations of input point clouds. The resulting measure is stable, scale- and shift-invariant, and suitable for nonparametric inference via permutation testing. A numerical illustration using dynamic attribute vectors from decentralized governance data demonstrates how the proposed method can capture regime shifts and evolving geometric complexity. Our results contribute to the theoretical understanding of random persistence and provide a rigorous statistical foundation for topological change-point detection in complex, high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Parametric equivariant Oka principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive complex Lie group and $K$ be a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. Let $X$ be a reduced Stein $G$-space and $Y$ be a $G$-elliptic manifold. We prove the following parametric equivariant Oka principle. The inclusion of the space of holomorphic $G$-maps $X\to Y$ into the space of continuous $K$-maps $X\to Y$ is a weak homotopy equivalence with respect to the compact-open topology. The proof is divided into a homotopy-theoretic part, which is handled by an abstract theorem of Studer, and an analytic part, for which we prove equivariant versions of the homotopy approximation theorem and the nonlinear splitting lemma that are key tools in Oka theory. The principle can be strengthened so as to allow interpolation on a $G$-invariant subvariety of $X$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-holomorphic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion, called quasi-holomorphic maps. These are real smooth maps equipped with a structure that imitates the singularities and singularity stratifications of holomorphic maps on the source and target manifolds, although the manifolds themselves carry no global complex structures. Some important examples of quasi-holomorphic maps are branched coverings and links of finitely determined holomorphic map germs. We show a Pontryagin--Thom type construction for a ``universal'' quasi-holomorphic map with prescribed multisingularities, from which all such maps can be induced, and a similar result for maps with prescribed singularities. Applying this, we prove that the Thom polynomials of holomorphic singularities determine the cohomology classes represented by the singular loci of not only holomorphic but quasi-holomorphic maps as well. As another application we define the cobordism groups of quasi-holomorphic maps with restricted multisingularities, whose classifying space was given by the above construction. We completely compute the free parts of these cobordism groups and in some special cases also obtain results on their torsion parts.</description>

Abstract: Adapting the construction of global Kuranishi charts to the contact setting, we associate to any non-degenerate contact manifold a flow category based on Reeb orbits and moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic buildings. The construction lifts contact homology and is natural in the sense that to any exact symplectic cobordism we can associate a flow bimodule between the flow categories of its ends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Ravenel's Thom spectrum $X(n)$, we introduce the concept of chromatic defect, which measures how far a spectrum is from being complex-orientable. We compute the chromatic defect of various examples of interest, such as finite spectra, the Real Johnson--Wilson spectra $ER(n)$, fixed points of Morava $E$-theories (with respect to finite subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group), and the connective image of $J$ spectrum. Moreover, an obstruction theory is developed for determining chromatic defect. Having finite chromatic defect is closely related to the existence of analogues of the classical Wood equivalence. We show that such equivalences exist in a wide generality and use them to construct $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed Adams--Novikov towers.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with $n+1$ marked points. In this paper we compute $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1))$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any prime $p$, where $\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1)$ denotes the sign representation of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$. The interest in these homology groups is twofold: on the one hand classes in these equivariant homology groups parametrize homology operations for gravity algebras. On the other hand the homotopy quotient $(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1})_{\Sigma_n}$ is a model for the classifying space for $B_n/Z(B_n)$, the quotient of the braid group $B_n$ by its center.</description>

Abstract: This paper contains some results about the topology of $\M_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$, where $\M_{0,n+1}$ is the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with marked points. We show that $\M_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ is not a topological manifold for $n\geq 4$, and it is simply connected for any $n\in\N$. We also present some homology computations: for example we show that $\M_{0,p+1}/\Sigma_p$ has no $p$ torsion, where $p$ is a prime. Lastly we compute $H_*(\M_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n;\Z)$ for small values of $n$, proving that $\M_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ is contractible for $n\leq 5$ while $\M_{0,7}/\Sigma_6$ is not.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the universal strictification adjunction from weak $\infty$-groupoids (modeled as simplicial sets) to strict $\infty$-groupoids (modeled as simplicial T-complexes). We prove that any simplicial set can be recovered up to weak homotopy equivalence as the totalization of its canonical cosimplicial resolution induced by this adjunction. This generalizes the fact due to Bousfield and Kan that the homotopy type of a simply connected space can be recovered as the totalization of its canonical cosimplicial resolution induced by the free simplicial abelian group adjunction. Furthermore, we leverage this result to show that this strictification adjunction induces a comonadic adjunction between the quasicategories of simplicial sets and strict $\infty$-groupoids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a category $\mathsf{List}$ whose objects are sets and morphisms are mappings which assign to an element in the domain an ordered sequence (list) of elements in the codomain. We introduce and study a category of simplicial objects $\mathsf{slist}$ whose objects are functors $\Delta^{op} \to \mathsf{List}$, which we call simplicial lists, and morphisms are natural transformations which have functions as components. We demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ supports the combinatorics of (non-symmetric) operads by constructing a fully-faithful nerve functor $N^l : \mathsf{Operad} \to \mathsf{sList}$ from the category of operads. This leads to a reasonable model for the theory of non-symmetric $\infty$-operads.
  We also demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ has the structure of a presheaf category. In particular, we study a subcategory $\mathsf{sList}_{\text{op}}$ of operadic simplicial lists, in which the nerve functor takes values. The latter category is also a presheaf category over a base whose objects may be interpreted as levelled trees. We construct a coherent nerve functor which outputs an $\infty$-operad for each operad enriched in Kan complexes. We also define homology groups of simplicial lists and study first properties.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $\xi_I \colon I^{\xi} \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^{\xi}$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under another compression system $\zeta$. This is applied to the case where $\xi = \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M{\'e}moli, to give an alternative proof of their theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</description>

      <title>The Levelwise Finite Generation of Free Tambara Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the levelwise finite generation of free polynomial $G$-Tambara functors in a collection of cases, most notably when $G$ is a finite Dedekind group or when $G \cong C_p \rtimes C_q$, $p &gt; q$ primes. In the process, we establish the permanence of various finiteness conditions under box products and norms $n_H^G$ of Tambara functors, including a weak Hilbert Basis Theorem.</description>
