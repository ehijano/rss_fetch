      <title>Function and form of U.S. cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between urban form and function is a complex challenge that can be examined from multiple perspectives. In this study, we propose a method to characterize the urban function of U.S. metropolitan areas by analyzing trip patterns extracted from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). To characterize urban form, we employ measures that capture road network topology. We cluster cities based on both form and function and subsequently compare these clusters. Our analysis of 52 U.S. metropolitan areas identifies 7 distinct clusters of cities that exhibit similar travel behavior, suggesting that diverse mobility patterns can be effectively grouped into a few universal classes. The observed disparity between the urban-function clustering and the urban-form clustering suggests that travel behavior in the U.S. is not strongly influenced by the physical infrastructure of the city.</description>

      <title>Higher-order modeling of face-to-face interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most fundamental social interactions among humans occur face to face. Their features have been extensively studied in recent years, owing to the availability of high-resolution data on individuals' proximity. Mathematical models based on mobile agents have been crucial to understand the spatio-temporal organization of face-to-face interactions. However, these models focus on dyadic relationships only, failing to characterize interactions in larger groups of individuals. Here, we propose a model in which agents interact with each other by forming groups of different sizes. Each group has a degree of social attractiveness, based on which neighboring agents decide whether to join. Our framework reproduces different properties of groups in face-to-face interactions, including their distribution, the correlation in their number, and their persistence in time, which cannot be replicated by dyadic models. Furthermore, it captures homophilic patterns at the level of higher-order interactions, going beyond standard pairwise approaches. Our work sheds light on the higher-order mechanisms at the heart of human face-to-face interactions, paving the way for further investigation of how group dynamics at a microscopic scale affects social phenomena at a macroscopic scale.</description>

      <title>Determining the Number of Communities in Sparse and Imbalanced Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community structures represent a crucial aspect of network analysis, and various methods have been developed to identify these communities. However, a common hurdle lies in determining the number of communities K, a parameter that often requires estimation in practice. Existing approaches for estimating K face two notable challenges: the weak community signal present in sparse networks and the imbalance in community sizes or edge densities that result in unequal per-community expected degree. We propose a spectral method based on a novel network operator whose spectral properties effectively overcome both challenges. This operator is a refined version of the non-backtracking operator, adapted from a "centered" adjacency matrix. Its leading eigenvalues are more concentrated than those of the adjacency matrix for sparse networks, while they also demonstrate enhanced signal under imbalance scenarios, a benefit attributed to the centering step. This is justified, either theoretically or numerically, under the null model K = 1, in both dense and ultra-sparse settings. A goodness-of-fit test based on the leading eigenvalue can be applied to determine the number of communities K.</description>

      <title>Transition to synchronization in adaptive Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of transition to synchronization in Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model in the presence of higher-order interactions and global order parameter adaptation. The investigation is done by performing extensive numerical simulations and low dimensional modeling of the system. Numerical simulations of the full system show both continuous (second order) as well as discontinuous transitions. The discontinuous transitions can either be associated with explosive (first order) or with tiered synchronization states depending on the choice of parameters. To develop an in depth understanding of the transition scenario in the parameter space we derive a reduced order model (ROM) using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, the results of which closely matches with that of the numerical simulations of the full system. The simplicity and analytical accessibility of the ROM helps to conveniently unfold the transition scenario in the system having complex dependence on the parameters. Simultaneous analysis of the full system and the ROM clearly identifies the regions of the parameter space exhibiting different types of transitions. It is observed that the second order continuous transition is connected with a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation (PB) of the ROM. On the other hand, the discontinuous teired transition is associated with multiple saddle-node (SN) bifurcations along with a supercritical PB and the first order explosive transition involves a subcritical PB alongside a SN bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Global Election Landscape on Social Media in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2024, half of the global population is expected to participate in elections, offering researchers a unique opportunity to study online information diffusion and user behavior. This study investigates the media landscape on social media by analyzing Facebook posts from national political parties and major news agencies across Europe, Mexico, and India. Our methodology identifies key topics and evaluates public interaction, reflecting broader trends in political engagement. Using Principal Component Analysis, we distil these topics to uncover patterns of correlation and differentiation. This approach reveals dominant themes that engage global audiences, providing critical insights into the interplay between public opinion and digital narratives during a major electoral cycle. Our findings highlight how different topics resonate across political spectrums, shaping political debate and offering a comprehensive view of the interaction between media content, political ideology, and audience engagement.</description>

      <title>Assessing inequities in electrification via heat pumps across the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat pumps are an energy-efficient and increasingly cost-effective solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. However, other clean energy technologies such as rooftop solar are less likely to be adopted in underserved communities, and thus policies incentivizing their adoption may funnel tax dollars to well-resourced communities. Unlike previously-studied technologies, the effects of heat pumps on household energy bills may be positive or negative depending on local climate, fuel availability and costs, and other factors. Here we propose a framework for assessing heat pump inequities across the U.S. We find that households in communities of color and with higher percentages of renters are less likely to use heat pumps across the board. Moreover, communities of color are least likely to use heat pumps in regions where they are most likely to reduce energy bills. Public policies must address these inequities to advance beneficial electrification and energy justice.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback in a network with two communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>
