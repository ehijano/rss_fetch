      <title>Ground state of a mixture of SU($3$) fermions and scalar bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a system composed of scalar bosons and SU($3$) fermions in one dimension. Considering only local intra- and interspecies interactions, the system is described by the Bose-Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which is studied using the density matrix renormalization group method. In addition to the common gapless and mixed Mott insulator phases, we identify unknown gapped states, in which bosons couple with some or all flavors of fermions. We unveil different flavor-selective states characterized by itinerant fermions that coexist with an insulator state where the bosons tie with only one- or two-flavor fermions. The states reported here could be implemented in cold-atoms experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunable nonlinear Landau-Zener tunnelings in a spin-orbit-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling is an important nonlinear phenomenon. We propose to stimulate the nonlinear tunneling in a spin-orbit-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. The system provides an experimentally tunable nonlinearity as well as multiple avoided crossings with tunable gap size in nonlinear dispersion relations. The nonlinearity generates tilted cusp and loop structures around the avoided crossings, and the physical consequence of these nonlinear structures is the nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling. The spin-momentum locking induced by the spin-orbit coupling leads to the time-resolved observation of the nonlinear tunneling by measuring atom populations.</description>

      <title>Phases and dynamics of quantum droplets in the crossover to two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets can become substantially extended when their binding energies become small upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the cross-over region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Necklace Ansatz for strongly repulsive spin mixtures on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative to the Bethe Ansatz method for strongly-interacting fermionic (or bosonic) mixtures on a ring. Starting from the knowledge of the solution for single-component non-interacting fermions (or strongly-interacting bosons), we explicitly impose periodic condition on the amplitudes of the spin configurations. This reduces drastically the number of independent complex amplitudes that we determine by constrained diagonalization of an effective Hamiltonian. This procedure allows us to obtain a complete basis for the exact low-energy many-body solutions for mixtures with a large number of particles, both for $SU(\kappa)$ and symmetry-breaking systems.</description>

      <title>Insulator phases of Bose-Fermi mixtures induced by intraspecies next-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional mixture of two-color fermions and scalar bosons at the hardcore limit, focusing on the effect that the intraspecies next-neighbor interactions have on the zero-temperature ground state of the system for different fillings of each carrier. Exploring the problem's parameters, we observed that the non-local interaction could favor or harm the well-known mixed Mott and spin-selective Mott insulators. We also found the emergence of three unusual insulating states with charge density wave (CDW) structures in which the orders of the carriers are out of phase with each other. For instance, the immiscible CDW appears only at half-filling bosonic density, whereas the mixed CDW state is characterized by equal densities of bosons and fermions. Finally, the spin-selective CDW couples the bosons and only one kind of fermions. Appropriate order parameters were proposed for each phase to obtain the critical parameters for the corresponding superfluid-insulator transition. Our results can inspire or contribute to understanding experiments in cold-atom setups with long-range interactions or recent reports involving quasiparticles in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanically-induced nonequilibrium quantum phase transition to a self-organized density wave of a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition (NQPT) in a hybrid quantum many-body system consisting of a vibrational mode of a damped nanomembrane interacting optomechanically with a cavity, whose output light couples to two internal states of an ultracold Bose gas held in an external quasi-one-dimensional box potential. For small effective membrane-atom couplings, the system is in a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) steady state, with no membrane displacement. Depending on the transition frequency between the two internal atomic states, either one or both internal states are occupied. By increasing the atom-membrane couplings, the system transitions to a symmetry-broken self-organized BEC phase, which is characterized by a considerably displaced membrane steady-state and density-wave-like BEC profiles. This NQPT can be both discontinuous and continuous for a certain interval of transition frequencies and is purely discontinuous outside of it.</description>

      <title>Polarons in supersolids: path-integral treatment of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersolid phase of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate has an intriguing excitation spectrum displaying a band structure. Here, the dressing of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid with the excitations of the supersolid is studied. The ground-state energy of the supersolid polaron is calculated using a variational path integral approach, which obtained accurate results for other polaron systems within the Bogoliubov and Fr\"ohlich approximations. A divergence is observed at the superfluid-supersolid phase transition. The polaron radius is also computed, showing that for strong impurity-atom interactions, the polaron can become localized to a single droplet, behaving like a small solid-state polaron.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum master equations beyond ultraweak coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Nathan and Rudner derived a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation from the Redfield equation. The claim is that the level of approximation is equal to that of the Redfield equation. Here we benchmark the Nathan-Rudner equation (NRE) against the exact solution of a damped harmonic oscillator and compare its performance to that of the time-dependent Redfield equation (RE). We find that which of the equations performs better depends on the regime considered. It turns out that the short-time dynamics is generally much better captured by the RE, whereas the NRE delivers results comparable to those of the rotating-wave approximation. For the steady state, in the high-temperature limit the RE again performs better and its solution approaches the exact result for ultrahigh temperatures. Nevertheless, here also the NR equation constitutes a good approximation. In the low-temperature limit, in turn, the NRE provides a better approximation than the RE. For too strong coupling, here the RE might even fail completely by predicting unphysical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Extensive Long-Range Entanglement at Finite Temperatures from a Nonequilibrium Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may however be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures -- the mutual information, its R\'enyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity -- that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R\'enyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Cosmological particle production in a quantum field simulator as a quantum mechanical scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>
