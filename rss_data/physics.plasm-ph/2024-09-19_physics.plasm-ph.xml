      <title>Single Langmuir Probe Diagnostics Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seeking to improve and innovate the technology currently used in their research work, the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico Plasma Laboratory designed and built a portable device able to generate a voltage sweep for an electrostatic probe (namely, a Single Langmuir Probe, or SLP) and to perform the computations necessary to determine the plasma temperature, and density as well as other parameters. The device uses a Raspberry Pi 4 to generate the voltage signal which is amplified through electronic circuitry in the range of -300V to +300V and applied to a SLP. The device is able to capture the current returning from the SLP to extract the relevant information from the IV characteristic and perform the computations necessary to obtain plasma electron density, plasma potential, floating potential, and electron temperature. All data is displayed through a touchscreen by a Graphical user interface developed in PyQT5. This device provides continuous measurement of plasma parameters during the realization of experiments at the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Analysis of high-field side plasma instabilities in tokamak edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balanced double-null configurations are of general interest for boundary plasma physics, and they have been proposed for some future designs. Experimental observations demonstrate absence of plasma fluctuations in tokamak high-field side scrape-off layer in a balanced double-null configuration [Smick et al 2013 Nucl. Fusion 53 023001], and it is commonly assumed that plasma instabilities are suppressed on high-field side in the edge plasma due to the stabilizing effect of magnetic curvature. At the same time, the experimental evidence points to extremely steep plasma density profiles on high-field side, which should provide a strong instability drive. In the present study, the drift-resistive-ballooning mode instability model is investigated analytically and numerically to determine the characteristics of plasma instabilities, turbulence, and transport in tokamak scrape-off layer on high-field side.</description>

      <title>Higher-order moment convergent method in weakly anisotropic plasma and the NLVFP code for solution of the 0D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion plasma is a typical non-equilibrium and nonlinear system, with the interaction between different species well described by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equations. The transport of mass, momentum, energy, and temperature relaxation are important issues, which are affected by the collision term of VFP even in so-called collision-less plasma domain. Hence, nonlinearity and collisions are crucial features in large regime. A successful numerical simulation for non-equilibrium plasma has to be able to conserve mass, momentum and energy, while to satisfy Boltzmann's H-theorem and higher-order moment convergence. An expansion of the distribution function in spherical harmonics (Legendre basis when the velocity space exhibits axisymmetry) in angle coordinate and in King basis in speed coordinate of velocity space is well suited to address these requirements. This paper reviews the formulation of the 0D-2V VFP equation in terms of spherical harmonics coupled with King function and its solution in our NLVFP code. In this topic review, we will introduce the background physics related to the nonlinear VFP simulation, then describe NLVFP for 0D-2V homogeneous, weakly anisotropic plasma with utilization of the Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPRS) collision operator.</description>

      <title>Analysis of energetic particle transport: diffusion and phase-space barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reduced 1D model describing the non-linear hybrid LIGKA/HAGIS simulations was developed and successfully tested in [Carlevaro et al. PPCF 64, 035010 (2022)] addressing the ITER 15MA baseline scenario. In this paper, we introduce a detailed phase-space and statistical analysis to characterize the emerging transport regimes. Deviations from purely normal diffusive dynamics is quantitatively analyzed, indicating the limitations of the usual quasi-linear description of energetic particle turbulent transport. Beside the emergence of a very complex dynamics of overlapping resonances and substructure formation, this analysis reinforces the evidence of avalanche excitation and energy transfer between modes.</description>

      <title>Radial Diffusion Driven by Spatially Localized ULF Waves in the Earth's Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves are critical drivers of particle acceleration and loss in the Earth's magnetosphere. While statistical models of ULF-induced radial transport have traditionally assumed that the waves are uniformly distributed across magnetic local time (MLT), decades of observational evidence show significant MLT localization of ULF waves in the Earth's magnetosphere. This study presents, for the first time, a quasi-linear radial diffusion coefficient accounting for localized ULF waves. We demonstrate that even though quasi-linear radial diffusion is averaged over drift orbits, MLT localization significantly alters the efficiency of particle transport. Our results reveal that when ULF waves cover more than 30\% of the MLT, the radial diffusion efficiency is comparable to that of uniform wave distributions. However, when ULF waves are confined within 10\% of the drift orbit, the diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 10 to 25\%, indicating that narrowly localized ULF waves are efficient drivers of radial transport.</description>

      <title>Electron surface scattering kernel for a plasma facing a semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the invariant embedding principle for the electron backscattering function, we present a scheme for constructing an electron surface scattering kernel to be used in the boundary condition for the electron Boltzmann equation of a plasma facing a semiconducting solid. The scheme takes the solid's microphysics responsible for electron emission and backscattering from the interface within a randium-jellium model into account and is applicable to dielectrics and metals as well. As an illustration, we consider silicon and germanium, describing the interface potential by a Schottky barrier and including impact ionization across the energy gap as well as scattering on phonons and ion cores. The emission yields deduced from the kernel agree well enough with measured data to support its use in the electron boundary condition of a plasma facing silicon or germanium.</description>

      <title>Cross-Calibration and First Vertical ECE Measurement of Electron Energy Distribution in the TCV Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the first Vertical Electron Cyclotron Emission (V-ECE) measurement of non-thermal electron distributions in the \textit{Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable}, TCV. These measurements were conducted in runaway electron scenarios and in the presence of Electron Cyclotron Current Drive. Measured intensities of linearly polarised X- and O-mode radiation from fast electrons allow the analysis of the energy distribution. The measurements were made possible through the creation of an operational regime for the diagnostic that is free of thermal background radiation, in relaxed electron density operations. This operational regime notably enables the cross-calibration of the diagnostic system, relying on thermal plasma measurements and modeling with the ray-tracing code SPECE.</description>
