      <title>Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory for Life Contingent Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the valuation of life contingent assets has been thoroughly investigated under the framework of mathematical statistics, little financial economics research pays attention to the pricing of these assets in a non-arbitrage, complete market. In this paper, we first revisit the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing (FTAP) and the short proof of it. Then we point out that discounted asset price is a martingale only when dividends are zero under all random states of the world, using a simple proof based on pricing kernel. Next, we apply Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing (FTAP) to find valuation formula for life contingent assets including life insurance policies and life contingent annuities. Last but not least, we state the assumption of static portfolio in a dynamic economy, and clarify the FTAP that accommodates the valuation of a portfolio of life contingent policies.</description>

      <title>The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximisation frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. Economic asset-pricing in this setting is found to decompose into the viable pricing of model-risk and of non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive risk-neutral equivalent formulation with convenient properties. Its parameter, a dynamically conserved constant of model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, such that their ex-post price-effects can be disentangled, through well-known price anomalies such as Momentum and Low-Risk.</description>

      <title>LQG Risk-Sensitive Single-Agent and Major-Minor Mean-Field Game Systems: A Variational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational approach to address risk-sensitive optimal control problems with an exponential-of-integral cost functional in a general linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) single-agent setup, offering new insights into such problems. Our analysis leads to the derivation of a nonlinear necessary and sufficient condition of optimality, expressed in terms of martingale processes. Subject to specific conditions, we find an equivalent risk-neutral measure, under which a linear state feedback form can be obtained for the optimal control. It is then shown that the obtained feedback control is consistent with the imposed condition and remains optimal under the original measure. Building upon this development, we (i) propose a variational framework for general LQG risk-sensitive mean-field games (MFGs) and (ii) advance the LQG risk-sensitive MFG theory by incorporating a major agent in the framework. The major agent interacts with a large number of minor agents, and unlike the minor agents, its influence on the system remains significant even with an increasing number of minor agents. We derive the Markovian closed-loop best-response strategies of agents in the limiting case where the number of agents goes to infinity. We establish that the set of obtained best-response strategies yields a Nash equilibrium in the limiting case and an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in the finite-player case.</description>
