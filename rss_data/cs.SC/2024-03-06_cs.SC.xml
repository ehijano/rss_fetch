      <title>Three Paths to Rational Curves with Rational Arc Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the so far open problem of constructing all spatial rational curves with rational arc length functions. More precisely, we present three different methods for this construction. The first method adapts a recent approach of (Kalkan et al. 2022) to rational PH curves and requires solving a modestly sized system of linear equations. The second constructs the curve by imposing zero-residue conditions, thus extending ideas of previous papers by (Farouki and Sakkalis 2019) and the authors themselves (Schr\"ocker and \v{S}\'ir 2023). The third method generalizes the dual approach of (Pottmann 1995) from planar to spatial curves. The three methods share the same quaternion based representation in which not only the PH curve but also its arc length function are compactly expressed. We also present a new proof based on the quaternion polynomial factorization theory of the well known characterization of the Pythagorean quadruples.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Symbolic Regression Datasets and Benchmarks for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10540v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits datasets and evaluation criteria for Symbolic Regression (SR), specifically focused on its potential for scientific discovery. Focused on a set of formulas used in the existing datasets based on Feynman Lectures on Physics, we recreate 120 datasets to discuss the performance of symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD). For each of the 120 SRSD datasets, we carefully review the properties of the formula and its variables to design reasonably realistic sampling ranges of values so that our new SRSD datasets can be used for evaluating the potential of SRSD such as whether or not an SR method can (re)discover physical laws from such datasets. We also create another 120 datasets that contain dummy variables to examine whether SR methods can choose necessary variables only. Besides, we propose to use normalized edit distances (NED) between a predicted equation and the true equation trees for addressing a critical issue that existing SR metrics are either binary or errors between the target values and an SR model's predicted values for a given input. We conduct benchmark experiments on our new SRSD datasets using various representative SR methods. The experimental results show that we provide a more realistic performance evaluation, and our user study shows that the NED correlates with human judges significantly more than an existing SR metric. We publish repositories of our code and 240 SRSD datasets.</description>
