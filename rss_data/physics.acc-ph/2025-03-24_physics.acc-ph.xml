      <title>Plasma treated metals after H- irradiation and its effect on vacuum breakdown behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum breakdown in accelerator structures is a critical challenge that occurs under high electric fields. In environments subjected to hydrogen ion irradiation or high beam losses, such as in Radio-Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQ), residual hydrocarbons from the vacuum may result in carbon contamination of the metal surfaces from charged particle induced cracking. Under these conditions, it has been assessed that surface carbon contamination leads to a decrement of the surface electric field holding properties. This study extends the latest research by exploring the efficacy of Oxygen Plasma Cleaning (OPC) on metal electrodes irradiated by low energy hydrogen ion beam with the purpose of reducing surface carbon contamination. OPC treatment has been employed on different metals, namely copper beryllium (CuBe2), oxygen-free copper (Cu-OFE), and stainless steel (SS316LN). Treated electrodes have been tested for electric field performance in a DC pulsed system and results compared with non-irradiated electrodes and irradiated ones without OPC treatment. The study indicates a significant reduction in carbon contamination by OPC, enough to allow irradiated materials to achieve performances comparable with the electric field strength of raw surfaces. Moreover, it has been observed that stainless steel samples had some alteration in the surface chemistry that enhanced the materials ability to sustain high electric fields while decreasing vacuum arcing events. Notably, OPC treated SS316LN electrodes surpassed the performance value of untreated ones, demonstrating the potential of plasma treatments in extending the operational performance of accelerator components.</description>

      <title>A Possible Future Use of the LHC Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FCC program at CERN provides an attractive all-in-one solution to address many of the key questions in particle physics. While we fully support the efforts towards this ambitious path, we believe that it is important to prepare a mitigation strategy in case the program faces unexpected obstacles for geopolitical or other reasons. This approach could be based on two components: I) a circular electron-positron collider in the LHC tunnel that operates at the Z-pole energy of 45.6 GeV and II) a high-energy electron-positron linear collider which acts as a Higgs, top quark and W-boson factory, and that can further be extended to TeV energies. The former could reach a high luminosity that is not accessible at a linear collider, the latter could probe the high energy regime with higher sensitivity and discovery potential than LEP3. The program should be flanked by dedicated intensity frontier searches at lower energies. These accelerators can be used in a feasible, timely and cost-efficient way to search for new physics and make precise determination of the parameters of the Standard Model.</description>
