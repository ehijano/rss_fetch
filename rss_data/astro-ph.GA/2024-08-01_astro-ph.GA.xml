      <title>The Radio Galaxy Environment Reference Survey (RAGERS): a submillimetre study of the environments of massive radio-quiet galaxies at $z = 1{\rm -}3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the environments of massive galaxies at high redshift is crucial to understanding galaxy evolution and the conditions that gave rise to the distribution of matter we see in the Universe today. While high-$z$ radio galaxies (H$z$RGs) and quasars tend to reside in protocluster-like systems, the environments of their radio-quiet counterparts are relatively unexplored, particularly in the submillimetre, which traces dust-obscured star formation. In this study we search for 850 $\mu$m-selected submillimetre galaxies in the environments of massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), radio-quiet ($L_{500 {\rm MHz}} \lesssim 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) galaxies at $z \sim 1\text{--}3$ in COSMOS. By constructing number counts in circular regions of radius 1--6 arcmin and comparing with blank-field measurements, we find no significant overdensities of SMGs around massive radio-quiet galaxies at any of these scales, despite being sensitive down to overdensities of $\delta \sim 0.4$. To probe deeper than the catalogue we also examine the distribution of peaks in the SCUBA-2 SNR map, which reveals only tentative signs of any difference in the SMG densities of the radio-quiet galaxy environments compared to the blank field, and only on smaller scales (1$^{\prime}$ radii, corresponding to $\sim0.5$ Mpc) and higher SNR thresholds. We conclude that massive, radio-quiet galaxies at cosmic noon are typically in environments with $\delta\lesssim0.4$, which are either consistent with the blank field or contain only weak overdensities spanning sub-Mpc scales. The contrast between our results and studies of H$z$RGs with similar stellar masses and redshifts implies an intrinsic link between the wide-field environment and radio AGN luminosity at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Different behaviour of the gas-phase and stellar metallicity in the central part of MaNGA galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantified the disparity between gas-phase and stellar metallicity in a large galaxy sample obtained from the MaNGA DR17 survey. We found that the gas metallicity is on average closely aligned with the stellar metallicity in the centers of intermediate-mass galaxies. Conversely, the difference is notably larger within the center of massive galaxies. It reaches about -0.18~dex on average for the most massive galaxies, while for low-mass galaxies, the gas metallicity exhibits a slightly lower value than the stellar metallicity. Moreover, the most prominent instances of a reduced gas-phase metallicity in relation to stellar metallicity were observed within the centers of massive red galaxies with low specific star formation rates. Because of the absence of a correlation between the integral mass fraction of neutral gas and the disparity between gas and stellar metallicity, we suggest that the diminished gas-phase metallicity in the centers of massive galaxies might be attributed to the replenishment of gas-depleted central regions through processes such as radial gas flows or accretion from the circumgalactic medium rather than gas infall from the intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>FAST observations of neutral hydrogen in the interacting galaxies NGC 3395/3396</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on high-sensitivity neutral hydrogen observations toward the gas-rich interacting galaxies NGC 3395/3396 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Compared to previous observations carried out by the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), a more extended HI envelope around this system has been detected. The total HI gas mass of the NGC 3395/3396 system is estimated to be 7.8 x 109 M. This value is 2.7 times more than that reported based on the VLA interferometric maps. Previous observations found a large HI tail extending to the south-west and a minor tail emerging from the north of this peculiar galaxy pair. Based on the high-sensitivity observations of FAST, an extended HI plume to the north-west and a gas plume to the north-east have been detected for the first time. Neutral hydrogen of the two smaller galaxies IC 2604 and IC 2608 on the south of the system have also been detected. We discuss the origins of these extra gas and possible tidal interactions between these galaxies. NGC 3395/3396's most prominent tidal feature, the south-west tail combined with the new detected north-west plume behaves like a large ring. We suggest the ring might be formed by the previous fly-by interaction between NGC 3395 and NGC 3396 which happened 500 Myr ago. Our study shows that high-sensitivity HI observations are important in revealing low column density gas, which is crucial to a deeper understanding of this interacting system.</description>

      <title>DESI Massive Post-Starburst Galaxies at $\mathbf{z\sim1.2}$ have compact structures and dense cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) are young quiescent galaxies that have recently experienced a rapid decrease in star formation, allowing us to probe the fast-quenching period of galaxy evolution. In this work, we obtained HST WFC3/F110W imaging to measure the sizes of 171 massive ($\mathrm{log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\sim\,11)}$ spectroscopically identified PSBs at $1&lt;z&lt;1.3$ selected from the DESI Survey Validation Luminous Red Galaxy sample. This statistical sample constitutes an order of magnitude increase from the $\sim20$ PSBs with space-based imaging and deep spectroscopy. We perform structural fitting of the target galaxies with \texttt{pysersic} and compare them to quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey. We find that these PSBs are more compact than the general population of quiescent galaxies, lying systematically $\mathrm{\sim\,0.1\,dex}$ below the established size-mass relation. However, their central surface mass densities are similar to those of their quiescent counterparts ($\mathrm{\,log(\Sigma_{1\,kpc}/(M_{\odot}/kpc^2))\sim\,10.1}$). These findings are easily reconciled by later ex-situ growth via minor mergers or a slight progenitor bias. These PSBs are round in projection ($b/a_{median}\sim0.8$), suggesting that they are primarily spheroids, not disks, in 3D. We find no correlation between time since quenching and light-weighted PSB sizes or central densities. This disfavors apparent structural growth due to the fading of centralized starbursts in this galaxy population. Instead, we posit that the fast quenching of massive galaxies at this epoch occurs preferentially in galaxies with pre-existing compact structures.</description>

      <title>CEERS Key Paper. IX. Identifying Galaxy Mergers in CEERS NIRCam Images Using Random Forests and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial yet challenging task in galaxy evolution studies is the identification of distant merging galaxies, a task which suffers from a variety of issues ranging from telescope sensitivities and limitations to the inherently chaotic morphologies of young galaxies. In this paper, we use random forests and convolutional neural networks to identify high-redshift JWST CEERS galaxy mergers. We train these algorithms on simulated $3&lt;z&lt;5$ CEERS galaxies created from the IllustrisTNG subhalo morphologies and the Santa Cruz SAM lightcone. We apply our models to observed CEERS galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;5$. We find that our models correctly classify $\sim60-70\%$ of simulated merging and non-merging galaxies; better performance on the merger class comes at the expense of misclassifying more non-mergers. We could achieve more accurate classifications, as well as test for the dependency on physical parameters such as gas fraction, mass ratio, and relative orbits, by curating larger training sets. When applied to real CEERS galaxies using visual classifications as ground truth, the random forests correctly classified $40-60\%$ of mergers and non-mergers at $3&lt;z&lt;4$, but tended to classify most objects as non-mergers at $4&lt;z&lt;5$ (misclassifying $\sim70\%$ of visually-classified mergers). On the other hand, the CNNs tended to classify most objects as mergers across all redshifts (misclassifying $80-90\%$ of visually-classified non-mergers). We investigate what features the models find most useful, as well as characteristics of false positives and false negatives, and also calculate merger rates derived from the identifications made by the models.</description>

      <title>The Villafranca project: Combining Gaia and ground-based surveys to study Galactic OB groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Villafranca project is studying Galactic stellar groups with OB stars combining information from $Gaia$ and ground-based surveys. We summarize the status of the project and we present its most important results. The Villafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for $Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars. We have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very young age ($\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the dynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the massive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars and black holes higher than previously considered.</description>

      <title>Photometric properties of classical bulge and pseudo-bulge galaxies at $0.5\le z&lt;1.0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the photometric properties and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of classical and pseudo-bulge galaxies with $M_* \ge 10^{9.5} \rm M_{\odot}$ at $0.5\le z&lt;1.0$, selected from all five CANDELS fields. We also compare these properties of bulge galaxies at lower redshift selected from MaNGA survey (Hu et al. 2024). This paper aims to study the properties of galaxies with classical and pseudo-bulges at intermediate redshift, to compare the differences between different bulge types, and to understand the evolution of bulges with redshift. Galaxies are classified into classical bulge and pseudo-bulge samples according to the S$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$rsic index n of the bulge component based on results of two-component decomposition of galaxies, as well as the position of bulges on the Kormendy diagram. For the 105 classical bulge and 86 pseudo-bulge galaxies selected, we compare their size, luminosity, and sSFR of various components. At given stellar mass, most classical bulge galaxies have smaller effective radii, larger $B/T$, brighter and relatively larger bulges, and less active star formation than pseudo-bulge galaxies. Besides, the two types of galaxies have larger differences in sSFR at large radii than at the central region at both low and mid-redshifts. The differences between properties of the two types of bulge galaxies are in general smaller at mid-redshift than at low redshift, indicating that they are evolving to more distinct populations towards the local universe. Bulge type is correlated with the properties of their outer disks, and the correlation is already present at redshift as high as $0.5&lt;z&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Detection of antifreeze molecule ethylene glycol in the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of complex prebiotic molecules using millimeter and submillimeter telescopes allows us to understand how the basic building blocks of life are formed in the universe. In the interstellar medium (ISM), ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) is the simplest sugar alcohol molecule, and it is the reduced alcohol of the simplest sugar-like molecule, glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO). We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of $aGg^{\prime}$ conformer of ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated column density of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is (4.5$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 155$\pm$35 K. The abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ is (1.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. Similarly, the abundances of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to CH$_{2}$OHCHO and CH$_{3}$OH are 3.1$\pm$0.5 and (6.1$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{-3}$. We compare the estimated abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of (CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$, and we notice the observed abundance and modelled abundance are nearly similar. We discuss the possible formation pathways of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular cores, and we find that $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ is probably created via the recombination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.</description>

      <title>Cloud Collision Signatures in the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular cloud collisions are a prominent theory for the formation of stars. Observational studies into cloud collisions identify the collision via a bridging feature: a continuous strip of line emission that connects two intensity peaks that are related in position space and separated in velocity space. Currently, most observations of collisions and these bridging features take place in the Milky Way disc. They are also theorized to take place in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), where temperatures and densities are both significantly higher than in the disc. For studies in the Milky Way Disc, the most commonly-used tracer tends to be CO. However, for studies in the CMZ, where the density and temperature are significantly higher, CO becomes so abundant that it loses its ability to adequately highlight the bridging feature of cloud collisions. As a result, studies have begun using other tracers, whose physical and chemical behavior has not been studied under CMZ conditions. We perform combined hydrodynamical, chemical and radiative transfer simulations of cloud collisions under both disc- and CMZ-like conditions, and investigate collision signatures in a number of commonly-observed molecular lines. Under the Milky Way disc conditions \( \co \) has the standard bridging feature; however, the other tracers, CS, HCO$^{+}$, N$_2$H$^{+}$ only emit in the intermediate-velocity bridge region, making the feature itself non-existent. In the CMZ, the higher density and temperature make the bridging feature far more indistinct for CO, but the other tracers have morphologically similar bridging features to the CO disc model, validating their use as tracers of cloud collisions under these conditions.</description>

      <title>VEGAS-SSS: Tracing Globular Cluster Populations in the Interacting NGC3640 Galaxy Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest stellar systems in the universe. As such, GCs population are valuable fossil tracers of galaxy formation and interaction history. We use the multi-band wide-field images obtained with the VST to study the properties of the GC population in an interacting pair of galaxies. We derived ugri photometry over $1.5x1.5deg^2$ centred on the galaxy group composed by two elliptical galaxies: NGC3640 and its fainter companion NGC3641. We studied the GC system properties from both the ugri and gri matched catalogs GC candidates were identified based on a combination of photometric properties (colors, magnitudes) and morphometric criteria (concentration index, elongation, FWHM), using sources with well-defined classifications from spectroscopic or imaging data available in the literature and numerical simulations as references. The selection criteria were also applied to empty fields to determine a statistical background correction for the number of identified GC candidates. The 2D density maps of GCs appear to align with the diffuse light patches resulting from merging events of the galaxies. The highest density peak of GCs is observed to be on NGC3641 rather than NGC3640, despite the latter being the more massive galaxy. The azimuthal averaged radial density profiles in both galaxies reveal that the GC population extends beyond the galaxy light profile and indicate the likely presence of an intra-group GC component. A color bimodality in (u-r) and (g-i) is observed for NGC3641, whereas NGC3640 shows a broad unimodal distribution. Analysis of the GC Luminosity Function indicates that both galaxies are roughly located at the same distance (~27Mpc). We provide an estimate of the total number of GCs, and determine the specific frequency for NGC3640, $S_N =2.0\pm0.6$, which aligns with expectations, while for NGC3641 we find a large $S_N=4.5\pm1.6$.</description>

      <title>Ram-pressure stripped radio tails detected in the dynamically active environment of the Shapley Supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radio continuum emission of four galaxies experiencing ram-pressure stripping in four clusters of the Shapley supercluster at redshift z~0.05. Multi-band (235-1367 MHz) radio data, complemented by integral-field spectroscopy, allow us to detect and analyse in detail the non-thermal component both in the galaxy discs and the radio continuum tails. Three galaxies present radio continuum tails which are tens of kiloparsecs long. By deriving the radio spectral index in the inner and outer tails and comparing our findings with the distribution of the extraplanar ionised gas and the results of N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate that these tails are caused by the ram pressure which, together with the ionised gas, sweeps the magnetic field from the galaxy discs. We suggest that the radio continuum emission in these tails can be differently powered by (i) in situ star formation; (ii) relativistic electrons stripped from the disc; (iii) shock excitation or a combination of them. All the ram-pressure stripped galaxies are found in environments where cluster-cluster interactions occurred and/or are ongoing thus strongly supporting the thesis that cluster and group collisions and mergers may locally increase the ram pressure and trigger hydrodynamical interactions between the intracluster medium and the interstellar medium of galaxies.</description>

Abstract: The intense star formation in starburst galaxies results in the formation of intense winds that sweep matter up to several kpc out of the galactic plane. These winds can be detected in many bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this opportunity, we present our project to study three edge-on galaxies, candidates to show extraplanar emission at radio wavelengths. We will describe the criteria followed in selecting the sample and the software developed to detect the presence of the wind. Besides, we will discuss the next steps of this project.</description>

      <title>FNet II: Spectral Classification of Quasars, Galaxies, Stars, and broad absorption line (BAL) Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we enhance the FNet, a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) with a residual neural network (ResNet) architecture, to perform spectral classification of quasars, galaxies, stars, and broad absorption line (BAL)-quasars in the SDSS-IV catalog from DR17 of eBOSS. Leveraging its convolutional layers and the ResNet structure with different kernel sizes, FNet autonomously identifies various patterns within the entire sample of spectra. Since FNet does not require the intermediate step of identifying specific lines, a simple modification enabled our current network to classify all SDSS spectra. This modification involves changing the final output layer from a single value (redshift) to multiple values (probabilities of all classes), and accordingly adjusting the loss function from mean squared error (MSE) to cross-entropy. FNet achieves a completeness of 99.00\% $\pm$ 0.20 for galaxies, 98.50\% $\pm$ 0.30 for quasars, 99.00\% $\pm$ 0.18 for BAL-quasars, and 98.80\% $\pm$ 0.20 for stars. These results are comparable to those obtained using QuasarNET, a standard CNN employed in the SDSS routine, comprises convolutional layers without the ResNet structure with equal kernel sizes, and is utilized for redshift measurement and classification by identifying seven emission lines. QuasarNET, in order to overcome the problem of finding a CIV emission line with broad absorption which is slightly more challenging than that of detecting emission lines requires to add BAL CIV line to the list of lines that the network learns to identify. However, this procedure is not necessary in FNet as it learns the features through a self-learning procedure.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the fundamental metallicity relation with observation and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity of galaxies is regulated by multiple astrophysical processes, which makes it a crucial diagnostic of galaxy formation and evolution. Beyond the fundamental mass-metallicity relation, a debate about the secondary galaxy property to predict the metallicity of galaxies arises. Motivated by this, we systematically examine the relationship between gas-phase metallicity and other galaxy properties, i.e. star formation rate (SFR) and galaxy size, in addition to stellar mass in both observation and simulation. We utilize the data from the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) survey and the TNG50 simulations. We find that the combination of $M_*/R_{\rm e}^\beta$ with $\beta\sim 0.6-1$ is in much stronger correlation to the metallicity than stellar mass alone, regardless of whether the SFR is included or not, in both observation and simulation. This indicates that galaxy size plays a more important role in determining gas-phase metallicity of galaxies than SFR. In addition, the TNG simulation predicts that the SFR, although being a subdominant role, becomes increasingly important in high-$z$ universe. Finally, we speculate that SFR modulates metallicity on the temporal dimension, synchronized with time-varying gas inflows, and galaxy size regulates metallicity on the spatial dimension by affecting the gravitational potential and the mass loading factor.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams are particularly sensitive probes of the mass distribution of galaxies. In this work, we focus on the Helmi Streams, the remnants of an accreted dwarf galaxy orbiting the inner Milky Way. We examine in depth their peculiar dynamical properties, and use these to provide tight constraints on the Galactic potential, and specifically on its dark matter halo in the inner 20 kpc. We extract 6D phase-space information for the Helmi Streams from Gaia DR3, and confirm that the Streams split up into two clumps in angular momentum space, and that these depict different degrees of phase-mixing. To explain these characteristics we explore a range of Galactic potential models with a triaxial NFW halo, further constrained by rotation curve data. We find that a Galactic potential with a mildly triaxial dark matter halo, having $p=1.013^{+0.006}_{-0.006}$, $q=1.204^{+0.032}_{-0.036}$, $M_{\rm{discs}}=4.65^{+0.47}_{-0.57}\cdot10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm{DM}}(&lt; 15 \text{kpc})=1.14^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\cdot10^{11} M_{\odot}$, is required to form two clumps in angular momentum space over time. Their formation is driven by the fact that the clumps are on different orbital families and close to an orbital resonance. This resonance also explains the different degrees of mixing observed, as well as the presence of a dynamically cold subclump (also known as S2). This first and very precise measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Galaxy uniquely reveals the high sensitivity of phase-mixed streams to the exact form of the gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>A Generative Modeling Approach to Reconstructing 21-cm Tomographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyses of the cosmic 21-cm signal are hampered by astrophysical foregrounds that are far stronger than the signal itself. These foregrounds, typically confined to a wedge-shaped region in Fourier space, often necessitate the removal of a vast majority of modes, thereby degrading the quality of the data anisotropically. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep generative model based on stochastic interpolants to reconstruct the 21-cm data lost to wedge filtering. Our method leverages the non-Gaussian nature of the 21-cm signal to effectively map wedge-filtered 3D lightcones to samples from the conditional distribution of wedge-recovered lightcones. We demonstrate how our method is able to restore spatial information effectively, considering both varying cosmological initial conditions and astrophysics. Furthermore, we discuss a number of future avenues where this approach could be applied in analyses of the 21-cm signal, potentially offering new opportunities to improve our understanding of the Universe during the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionization.</description>

      <title>Separating deterministic and stochastic gravitational wave signals in realistic pulsar timing array datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays indicate the presence of gravitational wave signals, likely from supermassive black hole binaries. These binaries can produce two types of signals: a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) or deterministic continuous gravitational waves (CGW). Correctly separating these signals is essential for accurate signal recovery and interpretation. This paper investigates the interaction between GWB and CGW signals within current analysis pipelines, focusing on misinterpretations and biases in parameter estimation when these signals are analyzed separately or together. We conducted several simulations based on the European PTA 24.8-year dataset. First, we injected either a GWB or a CGW. We compared parameter estimation using different search models, including Earth term only, combined Earth and pulsar term CGW templates, and correlated (HD) or uncorrelated (CURN) power law GWB templates. Our findings show that, when searched independently, the GWB and CGW signals can be misinterpreted as each other, and only a combined search can recover the true signal present. For datasets containing both a GWB and a CGW, failure to account for the CGW biases the recovery of the GWB. However, a combined search allows for the recovery of both GWB and CGW parameters without significant bias. Care must be taken with the method used to perform combined searches on these multi-component datasets, as the CGW pulsar term can be misinterpreted as a CURN. This can be avoided by direct searches for an HD correlated GWB plus a CGW. Our study underscores the importance of combined searches to ensure unbiased recovery of GWB parameters in the presence of strong CGWs, which is crucial for interpreting signals recently found in PTA data and represents a step toward a robust framework for disentangling stochastic and deterministic GW signals in future, more sensitive datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</description>

      <title>An all-sky catalogue of stellar reddening values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When observing astronomical objects, we must deal with extinction (i.e. the absorption and scattering of the emitted radiation by dust and gas between the source and the observer). Interstellar extinction depends on the location of the object and the wavelength. The different extinction laws describing these effects are difficult to estimate for a small sample of stars. Many sophisticated and automatic methods have recently been developed for estimating astrophysical parameters (age and metallicity, for example) depending on the reddening, which is usually treated as a free parameter within the corresponding estimations. However, many reddening values for stars have been published over the last few decades, most of which include observations in the ultraviolet, which are essential for a good estimation but are essentially no longer considered. We searched the literature through the end of 2022 for published independent reddening values of stellar objects based on various methods that exclude estimates from reddening maps. In addition, we present new reddening estimates based on the classical photometric indices in the Geneva, Johnson, and Stromgren-Crawford systems. These are based on well-established and reliable calibrations. After a careful identification procedure and quality assessment of the data, we calculated the mean reddening values of 157 631 individual available measurements for 97 826 objects. We find several statistically significant offsets and trends within the different references and discuss possible explanations for them.</description>

Abstract: We produce a new photometric calibration for the combined six-filter system formed by $Gaia$ DR2 + EDR3 $G$+$G_{\rm BP}$+$G_{\rm RP}$ using an improved STIS/HST spectrophotometric library with very red stars. The comparison between observed and synthetic photometry yields residual dispersions of just 3.4-8.7 mmag, resulting in the most accurate and precise whole-sky large-dynamic-range optical photometric system ever obtained. We include some tests and applications.</description>

      <title>MeerKLASS L-band deep-field intensity maps: entering the HI dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity maps, the final observations to be performed in L-band in the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) campaign. The observations represent the deepest single-dish HI intensity maps to date, produced from 41 repeated scans over $236\,{\rm deg}^2$, providing 62 hours of observational data for each of the 64 dishes before flagging. By introducing an iterative self-calibration process, the estimated thermal noise of the reconstructed maps is limited to ${\sim}\,1.21\,$mK ($1.2\,\times$ the theoretical noise level). This thermal noise will be sub-dominant relative to the HI fluctuations on large scales ($k\,{\lesssim}\,0.15\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$), which demands upgrades to power spectrum analysis techniques, particularly for covariance estimation. In this work, we present the improved MeerKLASS analysis pipeline, validating it on both a suite of mock simulations and a small sample of overlapping spectroscopic galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Despite only overlapping with ${\sim}\,25\%$ of the MeerKLASS deep field, and a conservative approach to covariance estimation, we still obtain a ${&gt;}\,4\,\sigma$ detection of the cross-power spectrum between the intensity maps and the 2269 galaxies at the narrow redshift range $0.39\,{&lt;}\,z\,{&lt;}\,0.46$. We briefly discuss the HI auto-power spectrum from this data, the detection of which will be the focus of follow-up work. For the first time with MeerKAT single-dish intensity maps, we also present evidence of HI emission from stacking the maps onto the positions of the GAMA galaxies.</description>

      <title>GEO and LEO: The Final Frontier for Plutonic FFP Parallax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that microlens parallaxes, $\pi_{\rm E}$, can be derived for free-floating planets (FFPs) with masses down to that of Pluto, by combining observations from a satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit with another observatory that is on or near Earth's surface, i.e., either ground-based or in low Earth orbit (LEO). Because these low-mass FFPs typically have measurements of the angular Einstein radius, $\theta_{\rm E}$, from finite-source effects, such $\pi_{\rm E}$ measurements directly yield the FFP mass $M=\theta_{\rm E}/\kappa \pi_{\rm E}$ where $\kappa$ is a physical constant. Such Earth-GEO measurements almost perfectly complement Earth-L2 measurements, which extend to higher FFP mass and greater FFP distance. LEO-only observations can yield mass measurement at even smaller FFP mass and nearer FFP distances. I discuss methods for breaking the Refsdal (1966) two-fold degeneracy in $\pi_{{\rm E},\pm}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of primordial black holes on the formation of the first stars and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BH) mergers and the stochastic GW background have triggered renewed interest in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the stellar-mass ($\sim 10 - 100\ \rm M_\odot$) and supermassive regimes ($\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}\ \rm M_\odot$). Although only a small fraction ($\lesssim 1\%$) of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs is required to explain such observations, these PBHs may play important roles in early structure/star/galaxy formation. In this chapter, we combine semi-analytical analysis and cosmological simulations to explore the possible impact of PBHs on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, taking into account two (competing) effects of PBHs: acceleration of structure formation and gas heating by BH accretion feedback. We find that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs (allowed by existing observational constraints) on primordial star formation is likely minor, although they do alter the properties of the first star-forming halos/clouds and can potentially trigger the formation of massive BHs, while supermassive PBHs serve as seeds of massive structures that can explain the apparent overabundance of massive galaxies in recent observations. Our tentative models and results call for future studies with improved modeling of the interactions between PBHs, particle DM, and baryons to better understand the impact of PBHs on early star/galaxy/structure formation and their imprints in high-redshift observations.</description>

      <title>Are isolated compact galaxy groups special?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But CGs have rarely been compared to regular groups, which are selected very differently. We study the global properties of a subsample of 80 groups of four members (CG4s), as well as their correlations, within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups, and compare them with those of the regular groups of Lim et al.. The latter are split into three control samples, complete in redshift and magnitude: one with the four brightest members, one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) with less than three magnitudes in range (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of quantum black and white hole horizons in an improved dynamic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14535v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum geometric effects near the locations where classical black hole horizons used to appear in Einstein's classical theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.</description>

Abstract: The application of clustering algorithms to the Gaia astrometric catalog has revolutionized our census of stellar populations in the Milky Way, including the discovery of many new, dispersed structures. We focus on one such structure, Theia 456 (COIN-Gaia-13), a loosely bound collection of ~320 stars spanning ~120 pc that has previously been shown to exhibit kinematic, chemical, and gyrochronal coherency, indicating a common origin. We obtain follow-up radial velocities and supplement these with Gaia astrometry to perform an in-depth dynamical analysis of Theia 456. By integrating stellar orbits through a Milky Way potential, we find the currently dispersed structure coalesced into a small cluster in the past. Via Bayesian modeling, we derive a kinematic age of 245 +/- 3 Myr (statistical), a half-mass radius of 9 +/- 2 pc, and an initial one-dimensional velocity dispersion of 0.14 +/- 0.02 km/s. Our results are entirely independent of model isochrones, details of stellar evolution, and internal cluster dynamics, and the statistical precision in our age derivation rivals that of the most precise age-dating techniques known today, though our imperfect knowledge of the Milky Way potential and simple spherical model for Theia 456 at birth add additional uncertainties. Using posterior predictive checking, we confirm these results are robust under reasonable variations to the Milky Way potential. Such low density structures that are disrupted by the Galactic tides before virializing may be ubiquitous, signifying that Theia 456 is a valuable benchmark for studying the dynamical history of stellar populations in the Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: We present ALMA Band 7 molecular line observations of the protostars within the VLA 1623 system. We map C$^{17}$O (3 - 2) in the circumbinary disk around VLA 1623A and the outflow cavity walls of the collimated outflow. We further detect red-shifted and blue-shifted velocity gradients in the circumstellar disks around VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W that are consistent with Keplerian rotation. We use the radiative transfer modeling code, pdspy, and simple flared disk models to measure stellar masses of $0.27 \pm 0.03$ M$_\odot$, $1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ M$_\odot$, and $0.64 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$ for the VLA 1623A binary, VLA 1623B, and VLA 1623W, respectively. These results represent the strongest constraints on stellar mass for both VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W, and the first measurement of mass for all stellar components using the same tracer and methodology. We use these masses to discuss the relationship between the young stellar objects (YSOs) in the VLA 1623 system. We find that VLA 1623W is unlikely to be an ejected YSO, as has been previously proposed. While we cannot rule out that VLA 1623W is a unrelated YSO, we propose that it is a true companion star to the VLA 1623A/B system and that the these stars formed in situ through turbulent fragmentation and have had only some dynamical interactions since their inception.</description>

      <title>eROSITA (eRASS1) study of Canis Major overdensity: Developing a multi-wavelength algorithm for the classification of faint X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12583</link>

Abstract: Using the data of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) taken during the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1), we perform the first X-ray classification and population study in the field of Canis Major overdensity (CMa OD), which is an elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity located at l = -240, b = -80. The study aims to identify the X-ray sources in CMa OD. For this purpose, we developed a classification algorithm using multi-wavelength criteria as a preliminary method for the classification of faint X-ray sources, specifically in regions with a high source number density. Out of a total number of 8311 X-ray sources, we have classified 1029 sources as Galactic stars and binaries in the foreground, 946 sources as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in the background, and 435 sources with stellar counterparts, which can belong to either the MW or CMa OD. Among the sources with a stellar counterpart, we have identified 34 symbiotic star candidates, plus 335 sources, of which the infrared counterparts have properties of M-giants in CMa OD. Moreover, there is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB, 4U 0728-25) in the field of our study, which, according to the Gaia parallax of its companion, seems to be a member of CMa OD. There is also a recently detected transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB, SRGt J071522.1-191609), which can be a member of CMa OD based on its companion that is most likely highly absorbed and is thus located behind the Galactic disk. In addition, we present the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of members and candidate members of CMa OD. It is dominated by sources with luminosities of &lt; 2*10^32-10^33 erg/s in the energy range of 0.2-2.3 keV, which are expected to be either accreting white dwarfs or quiescent LMXBs.</description>
