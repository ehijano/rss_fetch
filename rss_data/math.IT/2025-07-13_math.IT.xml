      <title>New constructions of $2$-to-$1$ mappings over $\gf_{2^n}$ and their applications to binary linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $2$-to-$1$ mapping over finite fields has a wide range of applications, including combinatorial mathematics and coding theory. Thus, constructions of $2$-to-$1$ mappings have attracted considerable attention recently. Based on summarizing the existing construction results of all $2$-to-$1$ mappings over finite fields with even characteristic, this article first applies the generalized switching method to the study of $2$-to-$1$ mappings, that is, to construct $2$-to-$1$ mappings over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^l}$ with $F(x)=G(x)+{\rm Tr}_{q^l/q}(R(x))$, where $G$ is a monomial and $R$ is a monomial or binomial. Using the properties of Dickson polynomial theory and the complete characterization of low-degree equations, we construct a total of $16$ new classes of $2$-to-$1$ mappings, which are not QM-equivalent to any existing $2$-to-$1$ polynomials. Among these, $9$ classes are of the form $cx + {\rm Tr}_{q^l/q}(x^d)$, and $7$ classes have the form $cx + {\rm Tr}_{q^l/q}(x^{d_1} + x^{d_2})$. These new infinite classes explain most of numerical results by MAGMA under the conditions that $q=2^k$, $k&gt;1$, $kl&lt;14$ and $c \in \gf_{q^l}^*$. Finally, we construct some binary linear codes using the newly proposed $2$-to-$1$ mappings of the form $cx + {\rm Tr}_{q^l/q}(x^d)$. The weight distributions of these codes are also determined. Interestingly, our codes are self-orthogonal, minimal, and have few weights.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Offloading Analysis of UAV-assisted NOMA-MEC Incorporating WPT in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the efficiency of secrecy data offloading for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-integrated mobile-edge computing (MEC) incorporating wireless power transfer (WPT) within an Internet of Things (IoT) network. Specifically, this study assumes an UAV to function in dual roles: as a mobile computation platform and as an aerial power-supply station, offering substantial advantages for resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) in mitigating interference from an passive eavesdropper. To assess the system's secrecy offloading efficacy, the secrecy successful computation probability (SSCP) closed-formed formulation under Nakagami-m fading channel is derived. The theoretical results are conducted with a variety of parameters, thereby validating the precision of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Unequal Importance of Coded Bits in the Decoding of Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar codes are widely used in modern communication systems due to their capacity-achieving properties. This paper investigates the importance of coded bits in the decoding process of polar codes and aims to determine which bits contribute most to successful decoding. We investigate the problem via a brute-force search approach and surrogate optimization techniques to identify the most critical coded bits. We also demonstrate how mapping these important bits to the most reliable channels improves system performance with minimal additional cost. We show the performance of our proposed bit mapping in OFDM based systems, and demonstrate up to x7 gain in BER performance.</description>

      <title>Learning to Transmit Over Unknown Erasure Channels with Empirical Erasure Rate Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of reliable data transmission within a finite time horizon $T$ over a binary erasure channel with unknown erasure probability. We consider a feedback model wherein the transmitter can query the receiver infrequently and obtain the empirical erasure rate experienced by the latter. We aim to minimize a regret quantity, i.e. how much worse a strategy performs compared to an oracle who knows the probability of erasure, while operating at the same block error rate. A learning vs. exploitation dilemma manifests in this scenario -- specifically, we need to balance between (i) learning the erasure probability with reasonable accuracy and (ii) utilizing the channel to transmit as many information bits as possible. We propose two strategies: (i) a two-phase approach using rate estimation followed by transmission that achieves an $O({T}^{\frac 23})$ regret using only one query, and (ii) a windowing strategy using geometrically-increasing window sizes that achieves an $O({\sqrt{T}})$ regret using $O(\log(T))$ queries.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance of Reconfigurable Intelligent Base Stations through Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a key capacity-boosting technology in 5G wireless systems. To reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains needed in such systems, a novel approach has recently been introduced involving an antenna array supported by a reconfigurable intelligent surface. This arrangement, known as a reconfigurable intelligent base station (RIBS), offers performance comparable to that of a traditional mMIMO array, but with significantly fewer RF chains. Given the growing importance of precise, location-specific performance prediction, this paper evaluates the performance of an RIBS system by means of the SIONNA ray-tracing module. That performance is contrasted against results derived from a statistical 3GPP-compliant channel model, optimizing power and RIS configuration to maximize the sum spectral efficiency. Ray tracing predicts better performance than the statistical model in the evaluated scenario, suggesting the potential of site-specific modeling. However, empirical validation is needed to confirm this advantage.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning ORBGRAND with Very Few Channel Soft Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is a universal decoding paradigm that decodes by repeatedly testing error patterns until identifying a codeword, where the ordering of tests is generated by the received channel values. On one hand, while testing error patterns in a descending order of posterior probabilities leads to maximum likelihood decoding, its implementation complexity is prohibitive. On the other hand, testing error patterns with a prescribed set of error patterns permuted by the ranking among magnitudes of log-likelihood ratios (i.e., ordered reliability bits, ORB) enables efficient implementation, but results in performance loss for finite-length codes. Aiming at harnessing the strengths of these two approaches, this work proposes a fine-tuning method to improve ORBGRAND, adjusting the ordering of tests with the aid of very few exact channel soft values. This method is based on a metric for assessing the ``well-orderedness'' of error patterns. The metric is studied via the lens of the asymptotic theory of integer partitioning, which provides highly accurate estimation in numerical experiments. The metric then leads to an effective identification of fine-tuning to conduct, at the cost of a negligible increment of complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning method achieves a substantial performance enhancement compared with ORBGRAND.</description>

      <title>Column Twisted Reed-Solomon Codes as MDS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study column twisted Reed-Solomon(TRS) codes. We establish some conditions for column TRS codes to be MDS codes and show that the dimension of their Schur square codes is $2k$. Consequently, these TRS codes are not equivalent to Reed-Solomon(RS) codes. Moreover, this construction method provides more flexible parameters compared to previous twisted generalized Reed-Solomon(TGRS) code constructions. For large odd prime power $q$, different from the systematically constructed TGRS codes whose length was previously limited to $\frac{q+1}{2}$, our construction achieves code lengths up to $\frac{q+3}{2}$. Finally, we present the dual codes of column TRS codes. This paper provides a new approach to construct MDS codes by adding column vectors to generator matrix of RS codes.</description>

      <title>Audio Inpanting using Discrete Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps, they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset, extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/</description>

      <title>On the $(k,\ell)$-multiset anonymity measure for social graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The publication of social graphs must be preceded by a rigorous analysis of privacy threats against social graph users. When the threat comes from inside the social network itself, the threat is called an active attack, and the de-facto privacy measure used to quantify the resistance to such an attack is the $(k,\ell)$-anonymity. The original formulation of $(k,\ell)$-anonymity represents the adversary's knowledge as a vector of distances to the set of attacker nodes. In this article, we argue that such adversary is too strong when it comes to counteracting active attacks. We, instead, propose a new formulation where the adversary's knowledge is the multiset of distances to the set of attacker nodes. The goal of this article is to study the $(k,\ell)$-multiset anonymity from a graph theoretical point of view, while establishing its relationship to $(k,\ell)$-anonymity in one hand, and considering the $k$-multiset antiresolving sets as its theoretical frame, in a second one. That is, we prove properties of some graph families in relation to whether they contain a set of attacker nodes that breaks the $(k,\ell)$-multiset anonymity. From a practical point of view, we develop a linear programming formulation of the $k$-multiset antiresolving sets that allows us to calculate the resistance of social graphs against active attacks. This is useful for analysts who wish to know the level of privacy offered by a graph.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Decoding Performance using Efficient Error Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lowering the resource overhead needed to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation is crucial to building scalable quantum computers. We show that adapting conventional maximum likelihood (ML) decoders to a small subset of efficiently learnable physical error characteristics can significantly improve the logical performance of a quantum error-correcting code. Specifically, we leverage error information obtained from efficient characterization methods based on Cycle Error Reconstruction (CER), which yields Pauli error rates on the $n$ qubits of an error-correcting code. Although the total number of Pauli error rates needed to describe a general noise process is exponentially large in $n$, we show that only a few of the largest few Pauli error rates are needed and that a heuristic technique can complete the Pauli error distribution for ML decoding from this restricted dataset. Using these techniques, we demonstrate significant performance improvements for decoding quantum codes under a variety of physically relevant error models. For instance, with CER data that constitute merely $1\%$ of the Pauli error rates in the system, we achieve a $10X$ gain in performance compared to the case where decoding is based solely on the fidelity of the underlying noise process. Our conclusions underscore the promise of recent error characterization methods for improving quantum error correction and lowering overheads.</description>

      <title>Total/dual correlation/coherence, redundancy/synergy, complexity, and O-information for real and complex valued multivariate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firstly, assuming Gaussianity, equations for the following information theory measures are presented: total correlation/coherence (TC), dual total correlation/coherence (DTC), O-information, TSE complexity, and the redundancy-synergy index (RSI). Since these measures are functions of the covariance matrix "S" and its inverse "S^-1", the associated Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions are of note. The DTC is shown here to be the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the inverse-Wishart pair "(S^-1)" and its diagonal matrix "diag(S^-1)", shedding light on its interpretation as a measure of "total partial correlation", -lndetP, with test hypothesis H0: P=I, where "P" is the standardized inverse covariance (i.e. P=(D^-1/2)(S^-1)(D^-1/2), with D=diag(S^-1)). The second aim of this paper introduces a generalization of all these measures for structured groups of variables. For instance, consider three or more groups, each consisting of three or more variables, with predominant redundancy within each group, but with synergistic interactions between groups. O-information will miss the between group synergy (since redundancy occurs more often in the system). In contrast, the structured O-information measure presented here will correctly report predominant synergy between groups. This is a relevant generalization towards structured multivariate information measures. A third aim is the presentation of a framework for quantifying the contribution of "connections" between variables, to the system's TC, DTC, O-information, and TSE complexity. A fourth aim is to present a generalization of the redundancy-synergy index for quantifying the contribution of a group of variables to the system's redundancy-synergy balance. Finally, it is shown that the expressions derived here directly apply to data from several other elliptical distributions. All program codes, data files, and executables are available.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on sequential locally recoverable codes (SLRCs), a special family of locally repairable codes, capable of correcting multiple code symbol erasures, which are commonly used for distributed storage systems. First, we construct an extended $q$-ary family of non-binary SLRCs using code products with a novel maximum number of recoverable erasures $t$ and a minimal repair alternativity $A$. Second, we study how MDS and BCH codes can be used to construct $q$-ary SLRCs. Finally, we compare our codes to other LRCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information measures can be constructed from R\'enyi divergences much like mutual information from Kullback-Leibler divergence. One such information measure is known as Sibson $\alpha$-mutual information and has received renewed attention recently in several contexts: concentration of measure under dependence, statistical learning, hypothesis testing, and estimation theory. In this paper, we survey and extend the state of the art. In particular, we introduce variational representations for Sibson $\alpha$-mutual information and employ them in each described context to derive novel results. Namely, we produce generalized Transportation-Cost inequalities and Fano-type inequalities. We also present an overview of known applications, spanning from learning theory and Bayesian risk to universal prediction.</description>

      <title>What should a neuron aim for? Designing local objective functions based on information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks. However, existing ISAC systems are based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which inevitably incur a loss in performance when balancing the trade-off between sensing and communication. Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to enhance ISAC performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. Nevertheless, exploiting more spatial channel variations requires larger antenna moving regions, which may invalidate the conventional far-field assumption for channels between transceivers. Therefore, this paper utilizes the MA to enhance sensing and communication capabilities in near-field ISAC systems, where a full-duplex base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit and receive MAs movable in large-size regions to simultaneously sense multiple targets and serve multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users for communication. We aim to maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication rates (WSR) by jointly designing the transmit beamformers, sensing signal covariance matrices, receive beamformers, and MA positions at the BS, as well as the UL power allocation. The resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve. Thus, we propose an efficient two-layer random position (RP) algorithm to tackle it. In addition, to reduce movement delay and cost, we design an antenna position matching (APM) algorithm based on the greedy strategy to minimize the total MA movement distance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the substantial performance improvement achieved by deploying MAs in near-field ISAC systems. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the proposed APM algorithm in reducing the antenna movement distance, which is helpful for energy saving and time overhead reduction for MA-aided near-field ISAC systems with large moving regions.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>LINE: Public-key encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a public key encryption cryptosystem based on solutions of linear equation systems with predefinition of input parameters through shared secret computation for factorizable substitutions. The existence of multiple equivalent solutions for an underdetermined system of linear equations determines the impossibility of its resolution by a cryptanalyst in polynomial time. The completion of input parameters of the equation system is implemented through secret homomorphic matrix transformation for substitutions factorized over the basis of a vector space of dimension m over the field F2. Encryption is implemented through computation of substitutions that are one-way functions on an elementary abelian 2-group of order 2"m. Decryption is implemented through completion of input parameters of the equation system. Homomorphic transformations are constructed based on matrix computations. Matrix computations enable the implementation of high security and low computational overhead for homomorphic transformations.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based optimization. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.</description>
