      <title>Stabilizing post-yielding behavior of a stretching dominated lattice structure through microstructural optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the microstructure on the mechanical response of lattice structures made of a defect tolerant Ti-14 Mo binary alloy fabricated by Electron Powder Bed Fusion. Some of the lattice structures were subjected to different heat treatments to compare different microstructures: a two-phase $\alpha$+$\beta$ microstructure inherited from the fabrication (as-built), a full $\beta$-metastable microstructure, and a $\beta$-metastable microstructure strengthened via nanoprecipitation of the $\omega$iso phase. We demonstrate that the macroscopic mechanical behavior of one of the most popular stretching-dominated lattice structure, namely the octet-truss, can be tailored through microstructural optimization by increasing the tolerance to plastic buckling of the constitutive struts. Defect-tolerant materials pave the way towards lattice structures fabricated by additive manufacturing with optimized energy absorption performances.</description>

      <title>Advancing MRI Reconstruction: A Systematic Review of Deep Learning and Compressed Sensing Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality and provides comprehensive anatomical and functional insights into the human body. However, its long acquisition times can lead to patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, strategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple receiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally, compressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from sparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the amount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with parallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI reconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for MRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods, including end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning, highlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights significant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI reconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based MRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration factors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based MRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging. To facilitate further research in this area, we provide a GitHub repository that includes up-to-date DL-based MRI reconstruction publications and public datasets-https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI.</description>

      <title>Registration of Longitudinal Liver Examinations for Tumor Progress Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing cancer progression in liver CT scans is a clinical challenge, requiring a comparison of scans at different times for the same patient. Practitioners must identify existing tumors, compare them with prior exams, identify new tumors, and evaluate overall disease evolution. This process is particularly complex in liver examinations due to misalignment between exams caused by several factors. Indeed, longitudinal liver examinations can undergo different non-pathological and pathological changes due to non-rigid deformations, the appearance or disappearance of pathologies, and other variations. In such cases, existing registration approaches, mainly based on intrinsic features may distort tumor regions, biasing the tumor progress evaluation step and the corresponding diagnosis. This work proposes a registration method based only on geometrical and anatomical information from liver segmentation, aimed at aligning longitudinal liver images for aided diagnosis. The proposed method is trained and tested on longitudinal liver CT scans, with 317 patients for training and 53 for testing. Our experimental results support our claims by showing that our method is better than other registration techniques by providing a smoother deformation while preserving the tumor burden (total volume of tissues considered as tumor) within the volume. Qualitative results emphasize the importance of smooth deformations in preserving tumor appearance.</description>

      <title>Solving Blind Inverse Problems: Adaptive Diffusion Models for Motion-corrected Sparse-view 4DCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is essential for medical imaging applications like radiotherapy, which demand precise respiratory motion representation. Traditional methods for reconstructing 4DCT data suffer from artifacts and noise, especially in sparse-view, low-dose contexts. Motion-corrected (MC) reconstruction is a blind inverse problem that we propose to solve with a novel diffusion model (DM) framework that calibrates an adaptive unknown forward model for motion correction. Furthermore, we used a wavelet diffusion model (WDM) to address computational cost and memory usage. By leveraging the prior probability distribution function (PDF) from the DMs, we enhance the joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) process, improving image quality and preserving resolution. Experiments on extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, yielding artifact-free, high-resolution reconstructions even under irregular breathing conditions. These results showcase the potential of combining DMs with motion correction to advance sparse-view 4DCT imaging.</description>

      <title>Generalized, sublethal damage-based mathematical approach for improved modeling of clonogenic survival curve flattening upon hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling can offer valuable insights into the behavior of biological systems upon treatment. Different mathematical models have been designed to predict the efficacy of hyperthermia (HT), radiotherapy (RT), or their combination. However, approaches capable of modeling cell survival from shared general principles for both mono-treatments and their co-application are rare. Moreover, some cell cultures show dose-dependent saturation in response to HT or RT, manifesting in survival curve flattening. An advanced survival model must, therefore, appropriately reflect such behavior. We propose a mathematical approach to model the effect of both treatments based on the general principle of sublethal damage (SLD) accumulation for the induction of cell death and irreversible proliferation arrest. Our approach extends Jung's model on heat-induced cellular inactivation by incorporating dose-dependent recovery rates that delineate changes in SLD restoration. The resulting unified model (Umodel) accurately describes HT and RT survival outcomes, applies to simultaneous thermoradiotherapy modeling, and is particularly suited to reproduce survival curve flattening phenomena. We demonstrate the Umodel's robust performance (R2&gt;0.95) based on numerous clonogenic survival datasets from the literature and experiments. The proposed Umodel allows the use of a single mathematical function based on generalized SLD accumulation principles with implemented radiosensitization, regardless of energy type or mechanism of action. It reproduces various clonogenic survival curve patterns, including flattening, thus encompassing treatment variability and potentially better reflecting tumor responses. Our approach opens options for further model development and therapy outcome predictions of sequential treatments in different orders and recovery intervals.</description>

      <title>A three-stage method for reconstructing multiple coefficients in coupled photoacoustic and diffuse optical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>

      <title>Latency correction in sparse neuronal spike trains with overlapping global events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: In Kreuz et al., J Neurosci Methods 381, 109703 (2022) two methods were proposed that perform latency correction, i.e., optimize the spike time alignment of sparse neuronal spike trains with well defined global spiking events. The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial latency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but relies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach their limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not sufficiently separated or even overlap.
  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages of the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency information as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift method instead of the much slower simulated annealing.
  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance, measured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not only on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit recordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the existing approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its low computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also be applied to very large datasets.
  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method both in terms of accuracy and speed. Importantly, it is the only method that allows to disentangle global events with overlap.</description>
