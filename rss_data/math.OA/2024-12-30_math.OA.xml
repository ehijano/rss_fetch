      <title>$p$-nuclearity of reduced group $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p\in (1,\infty)$ and let $G$ be a discrete group. G. An, J.-J. Lee and Z.-J. Ruan introduced $p$-nuclearity for $L^p$-operator algebras. They proved that the reduced group $L^p$-operator algebra $F^p_\lambda(G)$ is $p$-nuclear if $G$ is amenable. In this paper, we show that the converse is true. This answers an open problem concerning the $p$-nuclearity for reduced group $L^p$-operator algebras of N. C. Phillips.</description>

      <title>Operator K-Theory and Tempiric Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: David Vogan proved that if $G$ is a real reductive group, and if $K$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$, then every irreducible representation of $K$ is included as a minimal $K$-type in precisely one tempered, irreducible unitary representation of $G$ with real infinitesimal character, and that moreover it is included there with multiplicity one and is the unique minimal $K$-type in that representation. We shall prove that the Connes-Kasparov isomorphism in operator $K$-theory is equivalent to a $K$-theoretic version of Vogan's result.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger operators with non-integer power-law potentials and Lie-Rinehart algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators $H:= -\Delta + V$ with potentials $V$ that have power-law growth (not necessarily polynomial) at 0 and at $\infty$ using methods of Lie theory (Lie-Rinehart algebras) and microlocal analysis. More precisely, we show that $H$ is ''generated'' in a certain sense by an explicit Lie-Rinehart algebra. This allows then to construct a suitable (microlocal) calculus of pseudodifferential operators that provides further properties of $H$. Classically, this microlocal analysis method was used to study $H$ when the power-laws describing the potential $V$ have integer exponents. Thus, the main point of this paper is that this integrality condition on the exponents is not really necessary for the microlocal analysis method to work. While we consider potentials following (possibly non-integer) power-laws both at the origin and at infinity, our results extend right away to potentials having power-law singularities at several points. The extension of the classical microlocal analysis results to potentials with non-integer power-laws is achieved by considering the setting of Lie-Rinehart algebras and of the continuous family groupoids integrating them. (The classical case relies instead on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.)</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum 3-colorings of graphs and the quantum Max 3-Cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, to each synchronous non-local game $\mathcal{G}=(I,O,\lambda)$ with $|I|=n$ and $|O|=m \geq 3$, there is an associated graph $G_{\lambda}$ for which approximate winning strategies for the game $\mathcal{G}$ and the $3$-coloring game for $G_{\lambda}$ are preserved. That is, using a similar graph to previous work of the author (Ann. Henri Poincar\'{e}, 2024), any synchronous strategy for $\text{Hom}(G_{\lambda},K_3)$ that wins the game with probability $1-\varepsilon$ with respect to the uniform probability distribution on the edges, yields a strategy in the same model that wins the game $\mathcal{G}$ with respect to the uniform distribution with probability at least $1-h(n,m)\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}$, where $h$ is a polynomial in $n$ and $2^m$. As an application, we prove that the gapped promise problem for quantum $3$-coloring is undecidable. Moreover, we prove that there exists an $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which determining whether the non-commutative Max-$3$-Cut of a graph is $|E|$ or less than $\alpha |E|$ is RE-hard, thus giving a positive answer to a problem posed by Culf, Mousavi and Spirig (arXiv:2312.16765), along with evidence for a sharp computability gap in the non-commutative Max-$3$-Cut problem. We also prove that there is some $\alpha \in (0,1)$ such that determining the non-commutative (respectively, commuting operator framework) versions of the Max-$3$-Cut of a graph within a factor of $\alpha$ is uncomputable. All of these results avoid use of the unique games conjecture.</description>

      <title>Projective representation theory for compact quantum groups and the quantum Baum-Connes assembly map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the theory of projective representations for a compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$, i.e. actions of $\mathbb{G}$ on $\mathcal{B}(H)$ for some Hilbert space $H$. We show that any such projective representation is inner, and is hence induced by an $\Omega$-twisted representation for some unitary measurable $2$-cocycle $\Omega$ on $\mathbb{G}$. We show that a projective representation is continuous, i.e. restricts to an action on the compact operators $\mathcal{K}(H)$, if and only if the associated $2$-cocycle is regular, and that this condition is automatically satisfied if $\mathbb{G}$ is of Kac type. This allows in particular to characterise the torsion of projective type of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ in terms of the projective representation theory of $\mathbb{G}$. For a given regular unitary $2$-cocycle $\Omega$, we then study $\Omega$-twisted actions on C$^*$-algebras. We define deformed crossed products with respect to $\Omega$, obtaining a twisted version of the Baaj-Skandalis duality and a quantum version of the Packer-Raeburn's trick. As an application, we provide a twisted version of the Green-Julg isomorphism and obtain the quantum Baum-Connes assembly map for permutation torsion-free discrete quantum groups.</description>

      <title>A sharp symmetrized free transport-entropy inequality for the semicircular law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, following the recent work of Fathi (2018) in the classical case, we provide by two different methods a sharp symmetrized free Talagrand inequality for the semicircular law, which improves the free TCI of Biane and Voiculescu (2000). The first proof holds only in the one-dimensional case and has the advantage of providing a connection with the machinery of free moment maps introduced by Bahr and Boschert (2023) and a free reverse Log-Sobolev inequality. This case also and sheds light on a dual formulation via the free version of the functional Blaschke-Santalo inequality. The second proof gives the result in a multidimensional setting and relies on a random matrix approximation approach developed by Biane (2003), Hiai, Petz and Ueda (2004) combined with Fathi's inequality on Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>On various classes of supercyclic operators on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06011v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize supercyclic weighted composition operators on various function spaces. Moreover, we also characterize supercyclic adjoint of the weighted composition operator and supercyclic left multipliers acting on the space of compact operators. Next, we introduce the concept of Cesaro hyper-transitivity and give an example of a weighted composition operator which is supercyclic, but not Cesaro hyper-transitive. Finally, we illustrate our results with concrete examples. In addition, we introduce a class of non-porous subsets of the space of continuous functions on the real line vanishing at infinity. As an application, we consider the weighted composition operator on this space and we give sufficient conditions that ensure that the set of non-hypercyclic vectors for this operator is non-porous.</description>
