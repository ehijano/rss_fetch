      <title>EVODMs: variational learning of PDEs for stochastic systems via diffusion models with quantified epistemic uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Epistemic Variational Onsager Diffusion Models (EVODMs), a machine learning framework that integrates Onsager's variational principle with diffusion models to enable thermodynamically consistent learning of free energy and dissipation potentials (and associated evolution equations) from noisy, stochastic data in a robust manner. By further combining the model with Epinets, EVODMs quantify epistemic uncertainty with minimal computational cost. The framework is validated through two examples: (1) the phase transformation of a coiled-coil protein, modeled via a stochastic partial differential equation, and (2) a lattice particle process (the symmetric simple exclusion process) modeled via Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In both examples, we aim to discover the thermodynamic potentials that govern their dynamics in the deterministic continuum limit. EVODMs demonstrate a superior accuracy in recovering free energy and dissipation potentials from noisy data, as compared to traditional machine learning frameworks. Meanwhile, the epistemic uncertainty is quantified efficiently via Epinets and knowledge distillation. This work highlights EVODMs' potential for advancing data-driven modeling of non-equilibrium phenomena and uncertainty quantification for stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the autocorrelation function for time series with higher-order temporal correlations: An exponential case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal correlations in the time series observed in various systems have been characterized by the autocorrelation function. Such correlations can be explained by heavy-tailed interevent time distributions as well as by correlations between interevent times. The latter is called higher-order temporal correlations, and they have been captured by the notion of bursts; a burst indicates a set of consecutive events that rapidly occur within a short time period and are separated from other bursts by long time intervals. The number of events in the burst is called a burst size. Some empirical analyses have shown that consecutive burst sizes are correlated with each other. To study the impact of such correlations on the autocorrelation function, we devise a model generating a time series with higher-order temporal correlations by employing the copula method. We successfully derive the analytical solution of the autocorrelation function of the model time series for arbitrary distributions of interevent times and burst sizes when consecutive burst sizes are correlated. For the demonstration of our analysis, we adopt exponential distributions of interevent times and burst sizes to understand how the correlations between consecutive burst sizes affect the decaying behavior of the autocorrelation function.</description>

      <title>Learning Smooth and Expressive Interatomic Potentials for Physical Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become increasingly effective at approximating quantum mechanical calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, lower errors on held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during molecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and their performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to models failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The resulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks, including materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing catalyst activity of two-dimensional C$_4$N$_2$ through doping for the hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of pristine and doped C$_4$N$_2$ nanosheets as potential electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The pristine C$_{36}$N$_{18}$ nanosheets exhibit limited HER activity, primarily due to high positive Gibbs free energies ($&gt;$ 2.2 eV). To enhance catalytic performance, doping with B, Si, or P at the nitrogen site was explored. Among these systems, B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets exhibit the most promising catalytic activity, with a Gibbs free energy close to zero ($\approx$ -0.2 eV), indicating efficient hydrogen adsorption. Band structure, projected density of states, charge density, and Bader charge analyses reveal significant changes in the electronic environment due to doping. While stacking configurations (AA$'$A$''$ and ABC) have minimal effect on catalytic performance, doping - particularly with B -substantially alters the electronic structure, optimizing hydrogen adsorption and facilitating efficient HER. These findings suggest that B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets could serve as efficient cocatalysts when combined with metallic materials, offering a promising approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Learning the Exact Time Integration Algorithm for Initial Value Problems by Randomized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method leveraging extreme learning machine (ELM) type randomized neural networks (NNs) for learning the exact time integration algorithm for initial value problems (IVPs). The exact time integration algorithm for non-autonomous systems can be represented by an algorithmic function in higher dimensions, which satisfies an associated system of partial differential equations with corresponding boundary conditions. Our method learns the algorithmic function by solving this associated system using ELM with a physics informed approach. The trained ELM network serves as the learned algorithm and can be used to solve the IVP with arbitrary initial data or step sizes from some domain. When the right hand side of the non-autonomous system exhibits a periodicity with respect to any of its arguments, while the solution itself to the problem is not periodic, we show that the algorithmic function is either periodic, or when it is not, satisfies a well-defined relation for different periods. This property can greatly simplify the algorithm learning in many problems. We consider explicit and implicit NN formulations, leading to explicit or implicit time integration algorithms, and discuss how to train the ELM network by the nonlinear least squares method. Extensive numerical experiments with benchmark problems, including non-stiff, stiff and chaotic systems, show that the learned NN algorithm produces highly accurate solutions in long-time simulations, with its time-marching errors decreasing nearly exponentially with increasing degrees of freedom in the neural network. We compare extensively the computational performance (accuracy vs.~cost) between the current NN algorithm and the leading traditional time integration algorithms. The learned NN algorithm is computationally competitive, markedly outperforming the traditional algorithms in many problems.</description>

      <title>Why is the strength of a polymer network so low?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments have long shown that a polymer network of covalent bonds commonly ruptures at a stress that is orders of magnitude lower than the strength of the covalent bonds. Here we investigate this large reduction in strength by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the network ruptures by sequentially breaking a small fraction of bonds, and that each broken bond lies on the minimum "shortest path". The shortest path is the path of the fewest bonds that connect two monomers at the opposite ends of the network. As the network is stretched, the minimum shortest path straightens and bears high tension set by covalent bonds, while most strands off the path deform by entropic elasticity. After a bond on the minimum shortest path breaks, the process repeats for the next minimum shortest path. As the network is stretched and bonds are broken, the scatter in lengths of the shortest paths first narrows, causing stress to rise, and then broadens, causing stress to decline. This sequential breaking of a small fraction of bonds causes the network to rupture at a stress that is orders of magnitude below the strength of the covalent bonds.</description>

      <title>Neural Chaos: A Spectral Stochastic Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building surrogate models with uncertainty quantification capabilities is essential for many engineering applications where randomness, such as variability in material properties, is unavoidable. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is widely recognized as a to-go method for constructing stochastic solutions in both intrusive and non-intrusive ways. Its application becomes challenging, however, with complex or high-dimensional processes, as achieving accuracy requires higher-order polynomials, which can increase computational demands and or the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, PCE requires specialized treatments to manage random variables that are not independent, and these treatments may be problem-dependent or may fail with increasing complexity. In this work, we adopt the spectral expansion formalism used in PCE; however, we replace the classical polynomial basis functions with neural network (NN) basis functions to leverage their expressivity. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm that identifies NN-parameterized basis functions in a purely data-driven manner, without any prior assumptions about the joint distribution of the random variables involved, whether independent or dependent. The proposed algorithm identifies each NN-parameterized basis function sequentially, ensuring they are orthogonal with respect to the data distribution. The basis functions are constructed directly on the joint stochastic variables without requiring a tensor product structure. This approach may offer greater flexibility for complex stochastic models, while simplifying implementation compared to the tensor product structures typically used in PCE to handle random vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through several numerical examples of varying complexity and provide comparisons with classical PCE.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of machine learning techniques for conditional generative adversarial networks in inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning has been introduced in the inverse design of physical devices, i.e., the automatic generation of device geometries for a desired physical response. In particular, generative adversarial networks have been proposed as a promising approach for topological optimization, since such neural network models can perform free-form design and simultaneously take into account constraints imposed by the device's fabrication process. In this context, a plethora of techniques has been developed in the machine learning community. Here, we study to what extent new network architectures, such as dense residual networks, and other techniques like data augmentation, and the use of noise in the input channels of the discriminator can improve or speed up neural networks for inverse design of optical metasurfaces. We also investigate strategies for improving the convergence of the training of generative adversarial networks for inverse design, e.g., temporarily freezing the discriminator weights when the model outperforms the generator and training data blurring during the early epochs. Our results show that only some of these techniques improve inverse design models in terms of accuracy and stability, but also that a combination of them can provide more efficient and robust metasurface designs.</description>

      <title>Sharp-PINNs: staggered hard-constrained physics-informed neural networks for phase field modelling of corrosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown significant potential in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) across diverse scientific fields. However, their performance often deteriorates when addressing PDEs with intricate and strongly coupled solutions. In this work, we present a novel Sharp-PINN framework to tackle complex phase field corrosion problems. Instead of minimizing all governing PDE residuals simultaneously, the Sharp-PINNs introduce a staggered training scheme that alternately minimizes the residuals of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations, which govern the corrosion system. To further enhance its efficiency and accuracy, we design an advanced neural network architecture that integrates random Fourier features as coordinate embeddings, employs a modified multi-layer perceptron as the primary backbone, and enforces hard constraints in the output layer. This framework is benchmarked through simulations of corrosion problems with multiple pits, where the staggered training scheme and network architecture significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of PINNs. Moreover, in three-dimensional cases, our approach is 5-10 times faster than traditional finite element methods while maintaining competitive accuracy, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering applications in corrosion prediction.</description>

      <title>pylevin: efficient numerical integration of integrals containing up to three Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrals involving highly oscillatory Bessel functions are notoriously challenging to compute using conventional integration techniques. While several methods are available, they predominantly cater to integrals with at most a single Bessel function, resulting in specialised yet highly optimised solutions. Here we present pylevin, a Python package to efficiently compute integrals containing up to three Bessel functions of arbitrary order and arguments. The implementation makes use of Levin's method and allows for accurate and fast integration of these highly oscillatory integrals. In benchmarking pylevin against existing software for single Bessel function integrals, we find its speed comparable, usually within a factor of two, to specialised packages such as FFTLog. Furthermore, when dealing with integrals containing two or three Bessel functions, pylevin delivers performance up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard adaptive quadrature methods, while also exhibiting better stability for large Bessel function arguments. pylevin is available from source via github or directly from PyPi.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Scaling Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18025v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic exchange symmetry leads to fascinating quantum phenomena, from exciton condensation in quantum materials to the superfluidity of liquid Helium-4. Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond $\mathord{\sim} 100$ particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.</description>

      <title>Review of the finite difference Hartree-Fock method for atoms and diatomic molecules, and its implementation in the x2dhf program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive review of the two-dimensional finite difference Hartree--Fock (FD HF) method, and present its implementation in the newest version of X2DHF, the FD HF program for atoms and diatomic molecules. The program was originally published in Comput. Phys. Commun. in 1996, and was last revised in 2013. X2DHF can be used to obtain HF limit values of total energies and multipole moments for a wide range of diatomic molecules and their ions, using either point nuclei or a finite nuclear model. Polarizabilities ($\alpha_{zz}$) and hyperpolarizabilities ($\beta_{zzz}$, $\gamma_{zzzz}$, ${A}_{z,zz}$, ${B}_{zz,zz}$) can also be computed by the program with the finite-field method. X2DHF has been extensively used in the literature to assess the accuracy of existing atomic basis sets and to help in developing new ones. As a new feature since the last revision, the program can now also perform Kohn-Sham density functional calculations with local and generalized gradient exchange-correlation functionals with the Libxc library of density functionals, enabling new types of studies. Furthermore, the initialization of calculations has been greatly simplified. As before, X2DHF can also perform one-particle calculations with (smooth) Coulomb, Green-Sellin-Zachor and Krammers-Henneberger potentials, while calculations with a superposition of atomic potentials have been added as a new feature. The program is easy to install from the GitHub repository and build via CMake using the x2dhfctl script that facilitates creating its single- and multiple-threaded versions, as well as building in Libxc support. Calculations can be carried out with X2DHF in double- or quadruple-precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Nanoindentation of single crystalline Mo: Atomistic defect nucleation and thermomechanical stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical responses of single crystalline Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) metals, such as molybdenum (Mo), outperform other metals at high temperatures, so much so that they are considered as excellent candidates for applications under extreme conditions, such as the divertor of fusion reactors. The excellent thermomechanical stability of molybdenum at high temperatures (400-1000$^{\rm o}$C) has also been detected through nanoindentation, pointing towards connections to emergent local dislocation mechanisms related to defect nucleation. In this work, we carry out a computational study of the effects of high temperature on the mechanical deformation properties of single crystalline Mo under nanoindentation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of spherical nanoindentation are performed at two indenter tip diameters and crystalline sample orientations [100], [110], and [111], for the temperature range of 10-1000K. We investigate how the increase of temperature influences the nanoindentation process, modifying dislocation densities, mechanisms, atomic displacements and also, hardness, in agreement with reported experimental measurements. Our results suggest that the characteristic formation and high-temperature stability of [001] dislocation junctions in Mo during nanoindentation, in contrast to other BCC metals, may be the cause of the persistent thermomechanical stability of Mo.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Machine learning accelerated prediction of Ce-based ternary compounds involving antagonistic pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel quantum materials within ternary phase spaces containing antagonistic pair such as Fe with Bi, Pb, In, and Ag, presents significant challenges yet holds great potential. In this work, we investigate the stabilization of these immiscible pairs through the integration of Cerium (Ce), an abundant rare-earth and cost-effective element. By employing a machine learning (ML)-guided framework, particularly crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), combined with first-principles calculations, we efficiently explore the composition/structure space and predict 9 stable and 37 metastable Ce-Fe-X (X=Bi, Pb, In and Ag) ternary compounds. Our findings include the identification of multiple new stable and metastable phases, which are evaluated for their structural and energetic properties. These discoveries not only contribute to the advancement of quantum materials but also offer viable alternatives to critical rare earth elements, underscoring the importance of Ce-based intermetallic compounds in technological applications.</description>

      <title>T-matrix representation of optical scattering response: Suggestion for a data format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition matrix, frequently abbreviated as T-matrix, contains the complete information in a linear approximation of how a spatially localized object scatters an incident field. The T-matrix is used to study the scattering response of an isolated object and describes the optical response of complex photonic materials made from ensembles of individual objects. T-matrices of certain common structures, potentially, have been repeatedly calculated all over the world again and again. This is not necessary and constitutes a major challenge for various reasons. First, the resources spent on their computation represent an unsustainable financial and ecological burden. Second, with the onset of machine learning, data is the gold of our era, and it should be freely available to everybody to address novel scientific challenges. Finally, the possibility of reproducing simulations could tremendously improve if the considered T-matrices could be shared. To address these challenges, we found it important to agree on a common data format for T-matrices and to enable their collection from different sources and distribution. This document aims to develop the specifications for storing T-matrices and associated metadata. The specifications should allow maximum freedom to accommodate as many use cases as possible without introducing any ambiguity in the stored data. The common format will assist in setting up a public database of T-matrices.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than $1\,\%$ error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), enabling the mapping of microstructures to mechanical responses using solely physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields, Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. SPiFOL achieves significantly higher speed-up factors compared to conventional FFT solvers.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) highlights that ML-MCTDH is particularly well-suited for handling anisotropic models and provides more reliable results for two-point observables across all tested cases. The behavior of the corresponding entanglement dynamics is analyzed to reveal the complexity of the quantum states. Our findings indicate that the rate of entanglement growth strongly depends on the interaction range and the presence of disorder. This particular relationship is then used to examine the convergence behavior of ML-MCTDH. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Artificial Collisions, Filtering, and Nonlocal Closure Approaches on Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas are computationally challenging due to phase space mixing and filamentation, resulting in fine-scale velocity structures. This study compares three methods developed to reduce artifacts related to limited velocity resolution in Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson simulations: artificial collisions, filtering, and nonlocal closure approaches. We evaluate each method's performance in approximating the linear kinetic response function and suppressing recurrence in linear and nonlinear regimes. Numerical simulations of Landau damping demonstrate that artificial collisions, particularly higher orders of the Lenard-Bernstein collisional operator, most effectively recover the correct damping rate across a range of wavenumbers. Moreover, Hou-Li filtering and nonlocal closures underdamp high wavenumber modes in linear simulations, and the Lenard- Bernstein collisional operator overdamps low wavenumber modes in both linear and nonlinear simulations. This study demonstrates that hypercollisions offer a robust approach to kinetic simulations, accurately capturing collisionless dynamics with limited velocity resolution.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>
