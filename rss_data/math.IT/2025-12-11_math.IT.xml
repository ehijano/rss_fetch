      <title>SURA: Secure Unsourced Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces security for unsourced random access (URA) by employing wiretap-inspired physical layer techniques. To achieve confidentiality, the proposed system opportunistically exploits intrinsic features of feedback-aided URA without adding any overhead or altering its original structure or operational characteristics. As a result, the proposed system preserves the low-cost advantages of URA, including low delay and minimal signaling overhead, while providing secure communication. To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper. The simulation results show that meaningful secrecy is achieved in URA without modifying its structure and with negligible impact on standard performance.</description>

      <title>$t$-Fold $s$-Blocking Sets and $s$-Minimal Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blocking sets and minimal codes have been studied for many years in projective geometry and coding theory. In this paper, we provide a new lower bound on the size of $t$-fold $s$-blocking sets without the condition $t \leq q$, which is stronger than the classical result of Beutelspacher in 1983. Then a lower bound on lengths of projective $s$-minimal codes is also obtained. It is proved that $(s+1)$-minimal codes are certainly $s$-minimal codes. We generalize the Ashikhmin-Barg condition for minimal codes to $s$-minimal codes. Many infinite families of $s$-minimal codes satisfying and violating this generalized Ashikhmin-Barg condition are constructed. We also give several examples which are binary minimal codes, but not $2$-minimal codes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary self-dual sequences have been considered and analyzed throughout the years, and they were used for various applications. Motivated by a construction for single-track Gray codes, we examine the structure and recursive constructions for binary and non-binary self-dual sequences. The feedback shift registers that generate such sequences are discussed. The connections between these sequences and maximum period single-track codes are discussed. Maximum period non-binary single-track Gray codes of length $p^t$ and period $p^{p^t}$ are constructed. These are the first infinite families of maximum period codes presented in the literature.</description>

      <title>Typical Solutions of Multi-User Linearly-Decomposable Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve, in the typical-case sense, the multi-sender linearly-decomposable distributed computing problem introduced by tessellated distributed computing. We model real-valued encoders/decoders and demand matrices, and assess structural fidelity via a thresholded graph edit distance between the demand support and the two-hop support of the computed product. Our analysis yields: a closed-form second-moment (Frobenius) risk under spike-and-slab ensembles; deterministic links between thresholded GED and norm error; a Gaussian surrogate with sub-exponential tails that exposes explicit recall lines; concentration of GED and operator-norm control; and a compute-capped design with a visible knee. We map the rules to aeronautical and satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal containment and sparse factors of iid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce infinitesimal weak containment for measure-preserving actions of a countable group $\Gamma$: an action $(X,\mu)$ is infinitesimally contained in $(Y,\nu)$ if the statistics of the action of $\Gamma$ on small measure subsets of $X$ can be approximated inside $Y$. We show that the Bernoulli shift $[0,1]^\Gamma$ is infinitesimally contained in the left-regular action of $\Gamma$. For exact groups, this implies that sparse factor-of-iid subsets of $\Gamma$ are approximately hyperfinite. We use it to quantify a theorem of Chifan--Ioana on measured subrelations of the Bernoulli shift of an exact group. For the proof of infinitesimal containment we define \emph{entropy support maps}, which take a small subset $U$ of $\{0,1\}^I$ and assign weights to coordinates above every point of $U$, according to how ''important'' they are for the structure of the set.</description>

      <title>Explainable Verification of Hierarchical Workflows Mined from Event Logs with Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Workflow mining discovers hierarchical process trees from event logs, but it remains unclear why such models satisfy or violate logical properties, or how individual elements contribute to overall behavior. We propose to translate mined workflows into logical specifications and analyze properties such as satisfiability, liveness, and safety with automated theorem provers. On this basis, we adapt Shapley values from cooperative game theory to attribute outcomes to workflow elements and quantify their contributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that this combination identifies critical nodes, reveals redundancies, and exposes harmful structures. This outlines a novel direction for explainable workflow analysis with direct relevance to software engineering practice, supporting compliance checks, process optimization, redundancy reduction, and the design of next-generation process mining tools.</description>

      <title>Flexible Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Covert Communications in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a key role in wireless communication networks due to their flexibility and dynamic adaptability. However, the openness of UAV-based communications leads to security and privacy concerns in wireless transmissions. This paper investigates a framework of UAV covert communications which introduces flexible reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (F-RIS) in UAV networks. Unlike traditional RIS, F-RIS provides advanced deployment flexibility by conforming to curved surfaces and dynamically reconfiguring its electromagnetic properties to enhance the covert communication performance. We establish an electromagnetic model for F-RIS and further develop a fitted model that describes the relationship between F-RIS reflection amplitude, reflection phase, and incident angle. To maximize the covert transmission rate among UAVs while meeting the covert constraint and public transmission constraint, we introduce a strategy of jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, F-RIS reflection vectors, F-RIS incident angles, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power allocation. Considering this is a complicated non-convex optimization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm-based optimization solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework and optimization method significantly outperform traditional benchmarks, and highlight the advantages of F-RIS in enhancing covert communication performance within UAV networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal certification of constant-local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of certifying local Hamiltonians from real-time access to their dynamics. Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$, matching the known $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Entropy Functions on Two-Dimensional Faces of Polymatroidal Region of Degree Four: Part I: Problem Formulation and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06250v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special structures. In this series of two papers, we characterize entropy functions on the 2-dimensional faces of the polymatroidal region of degree 4. In Part I, we formulate the problem, enumerate all 59 types of 2-dimensional faces of the region by an algorithm, and fully characterize entropy functions on 49 types of them. Among them, those non-trivial cases are mainly characterized by the graph-coloring technique. The entropy functions on the remaining 10 types of faces will be characterized in Part II, among which 8 types are fully characterized, and 2 types are partially characterized.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Roch bases for arbitrary elliptic curve divisors and their application in cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents explicit constructions of bases for Riemann-Roch spaces associated with arbitrary divisors on elliptic curves. In the context of algebraic geometry codes, the knowledge of an explicit basis for arbitrary divisors is especially valuable, as it enables efficient code construction. From a cryptographic point of view, codes associated with arbitrary divisors with many points are closer to Goppa codes, making them attractive for embedding in the McEliece cryptosystem. Using the results obtained in this work, it is also possible to efficiently construct quasi-cyclic subfield subcodes of elliptic codes. These codes enable a significant reduction in public key size for the McEliece cryptosystem and, consequently, represent promising candidates for integration into post-quantum code-based schemes.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via matrix projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15842v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel posed the problem of determining the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with angle $\arccos(\alpha)$ and gave a partial answer in the regime $r \leq 1/\alpha^2 - 2$. At the other extreme where $r$ is at least exponential in $1/\alpha$, recent breakthroughs have led to an almost complete resolution of this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new method for obtaining upper bounds which unifies and improves upon previous approaches, thereby yielding bounds which bridge the gap between the aforementioned regimes and are best possible either exactly or up to a small multiplicative constant. Our approach relies on orthogonal projection of matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product and as a byproduct, it yields the first extension of the Alon-Boppana theorem to dense graphs, with equality for strongly regular graphs corresponding to $\binom{r+1}{2}$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$. Applications of our method in the complex setting will be discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Quantum CSS Error-Correcting Codes via MacWilliams Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum stabilizer codes, one of the most important classes for practical implementations, on both symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels. To this aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with \acl{MW} decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of the bounds over the depolarizing channel. We introduce a novel approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis, allowing the derivation of the exact asymptotic error rate for short codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $\rho \to 0$, the logical error rate $\rho_\mathrm{L}$ is asymptotically $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16 \rho^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16.3 \rho^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 18.7 \rho^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 149.3 \rho^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For larger codes our bound provides $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 1215 \rho^4$ and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 663 \rho^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the $[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively. Finally, we extend our analysis to include realistic, noisy syndrome extraction circuits by modeling error propagation throughout gadgets. This enables estimation of logical error rates under faulty measurements. The performance analysis serves as a design tool for developing fault-tolerant quantum systems by guiding the selection of quantum codes based on their error correction capability. Additionally, it offers a novel perspective on quantum degeneracy, showing it represents the fraction of non-correctable error patterns shared by multiple logical operators.</description>

      <title>Refining Concentration for Gaussian Quadratic Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We slightly modify the proof of Hanson-Wright inequality (HWI) for concentration of Gaussian quadratic chaos where we tighten the bound by increasing the absolute constant in its formulation from the largest known value of 0.125 to at least 0.145 in the symmetric case. We also present a sharper version of an inequality due to Laurent and Massart (LMI) through which we increase the absolute constant in HWI from the largest available value of approximately $0.134$ due to LMI itself to at least $0.152$ in the positive-semidefinite case. A new sequence of concentration bounds indexed by $m=1,2,3,\cdots, \infty$ is developed that involves Schatten norms of the underlying matrix. The case $m=1$ recovers HWI. These bounds undergo a phase transition in the sense that if the tail parameter is smaller than a critical threshold $\tau_c$, then $m=1$ is the tightest and if it is larger than $\tau_c$, then $m=\infty$ is the tightest. This leads to a novel bound called the~$m_\infty$-bound. A separate concentration bound named twin to HWI is also developed that is tighter than HWI for both sufficiently small and large tail parameter. Finally, we explore concentration bounds when the underlying matrix is positive-semidefinite and only the dimension~$n$ and its largest eigenvalue are known. Five candidates are examined, namely, the $m_\infty$-bound, relaxed versions of HWI and LMI, the $\chi^2$-bound and the large deviations bound. The sharpest among these is always either the $m_\infty$-bound or the $\chi^2$-bound. The case of even dimension is given special attention. If $n=2,4,6$, the $\chi^2$-bound is tighter than the $m_\infty$-bound. If $n$ is an even integer greater than or equal to 8, the $m_\infty$-bound is sharper than the $\chi^2$-bound if and only if the ratio of the tail parameter over the largest eigenvalue lies inside a finite open interval which expands indefinitely as $n$ grows.</description>

      <title>PROPS: Progressively Private Self-alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms. Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD), provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy, which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval, Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based alignment.</description>

      <title>Good quantum codes with addressable and parallelizable transversal non-Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that for any $m&gt;1$, there exists a family of good qudit quantum codes supporting transversal logical $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ gates that can address specified logical qudits and be largely executed in parallel. Building on the family of good quantum error-correcting codes presented in He et al. (2025), which support addressable and transversal logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, we extend their framework and show how to perform large sets of gates in parallel. The construction relies on the classical algebraic geometry codes of Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006). Our results lead to a substantial reduction in the depth overhead of multi-control-$Z$ circuits. In particular, we show that the minimal depth of any logical $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ circuit involving qudits from $m$ distinct code blocks is upper bounded by $O(k^{m-1})$, where $k$ is the code dimension. While this overhead is optimal for dense $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ circuits, for sparse circuits we discuss how the depth overhead can be significantly reduced by exploiting the structure of the quantum code.</description>

      <title>Forgetting-MarI: LLM Unlearning via Marginal Information Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.</description>
