      <title>FOSS solution for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Automation and Collaboration with MDSGAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of setting up and successfully running Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) is outlined to be incredibly labour and computationally expensive with a very high barrier to entry for newcomers wishing to utilise the benefits and insights of MDS. Here, presented, is a unique Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solution that aims to not only reduce the barrier of entry for new Molecular Dynamics (MD) users, but also significantly reduce the setup time and hardware utilisation overhead for even highly experienced MD researchers. This is accomplished through the creation of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Generator and Analysis Tool (MDSGAT) which currently serves as a viable alternative to other restrictive or privatised MDS Graphical solutions with a unique design that allows for seamless collaboration and distribution of exact MD simulation setups and initialisation parameters through a single setup file. This solution is designed from the start with a modular mindset allowing for additional software expansion to incorporate numerous extra MDS packages and analysis methods over time</description>

      <title>Rediscovering Hyperelasticity by Deep Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of the mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials under multi-axial loading constitutes a long-standing challenge in hyperelastic material modeling. This work employs deep symbolic regression as an interpretable machine learning approach to discover novel strain energy functions directly from experimental results, with a specific focus on the classical Treloar and Kawabata data sets for vulcanized rubber. The proposed approach circumvents traditional human model selection biases by exploring possible functional forms of strain energy functions, expressed in terms of both the first and second principal invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. The resulting models exhibit high predictive accuracy for various deformation modes, including uniaxial tension, pure shear, equal biaxial tension, and biaxial loading. This work underscores the potential of deep symbolic regression in advancing hyperelastic material modeling and highlights the importance of considering both invariants in capturing the complex behaviors of rubber-like materials.</description>

      <title>From Theory to Application: A Practical Introduction to Neural Operators in Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This focused review explores a range of neural operator architectures for approximating solutions to parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), emphasizing high-level concepts and practical implementation strategies. The study covers foundational models such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), Principal Component Analysis-based Neural Networks (PCANet), and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), providing comparative insights into their core methodologies and performance. These architectures are demonstrated on two classical linear parametric PDEs: the Poisson equation and linear elastic deformation. Beyond forward problem-solving, the review delves into applying neural operators as surrogates in Bayesian inference problems, showcasing their effectiveness in accelerating posterior inference while maintaining accuracy. The paper concludes by discussing current challenges, particularly in controlling prediction accuracy and generalization. It outlines emerging strategies to address these issues, such as residual-based error correction and multi-level training. This review can be seen as a comprehensive guide to implementing neural operators and integrating them into scientific computing workflows.</description>

      <title>Function-Coherent Gambles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces {\em function-coherent gambles}, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.</description>

      <title>GaussianCAD: Robust Self-Supervised CAD Reconstruction from Three Orthographic Views Using 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automatic reconstruction of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from CAD sketches has recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth. Experiments on the Sub-Fusion360 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches in CAD reconstruction performance and exhibits strong robustness to noisy inputs.</description>

      <title>Deep Muscle EMG construction using A Physics-Integrated Deep Learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG)--based computational musculoskeletal modeling is a non-invasive method for studying musculotendon function, human movement, and neuromuscular control, providing estimates of internal variables like muscle forces and joint torques. However, EMG signals from deeper muscles are often challenging to measure by placing the surface EMG electrodes and unfeasible to measure directly using invasive methods. The restriction to the access of EMG data from deeper muscles poses a considerable obstacle to the broad adoption of EMG-driven modeling techniques. A strategic alternative is to use an estimation algorithm to approximate the missing EMG signals from deeper muscle. A similar strategy is used in physics-informed deep learning, where the features of physical systems are learned without labeled data. In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning algorithm, namely the neural musculoskeletal model (NMM), that integrates physics-informed and data-driven deep learning to approximate the EMG signals from the deeper muscles. While data-driven modeling is used to predict the missing EMG signals, physics-based modeling engraves the subject-specific information into the predictions. Experimental verifications on five test subjects are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed hybrid framework. The proposed NMM is validated against the joint torque computed from 'OpenSim' software. The predicted deep EMG signals are also compared against the state-of-the-art muscle synergy extrapolation (MSE) approach, where the proposed NMM completely outperforms the existing MSE framework by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>A consistent mixed-dimensional coupling approach for 1D Cosserat beams and 2D surfaces in 3D space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article proposes a novel computational method for coupling arbitrarily curved 1D fibers with a 2D surface as defined, e.g., by the 2D surfaces of a 3D solid body or by 2D shell formulations. The fibers are modeled as 1D Cosserat continua (beams) with six local degrees of freedom, three positional and three rotational ones. A kinematically consistent 1D-2D coupling scheme for this problem type is proposed considering the positional and rotational degrees of freedom along the beams. The positional degrees of freedom are coupled by enforcing a constant normal distance between a point on the beam centerline and a corresponding point on the surface. This strategy requires a consistent description of the surface normal vector field to guarantee fundamental mechanical properties such as conservation of angular momentum. Coupling of the rotational degrees of freedom of the beams and a suitable rotation tensor representing the local orientation within a solid volume has been considered in a previous contribution. In the present work, this coupling approach will be extended by constructing rotation tensors that are representative of local surface orientations. Several numerical examples demonstrate the consistency, robustness and accuracy of the proposed method. To showcase its applicability to multi-physics systems of practical relevance, the fluid-structure interaction example of a vascular stent is presented.</description>

      <title>AgileRate: Bringing Adaptivity and Robustness to DeFi Lending Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also controlling default and liquidation risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. We propose two complementary approaches to mitigating adversarial manipulation: an algorithmic method that detects extreme demand and supply fluctuations and a market-based strategy that enhances elasticity, potentially via interest rate derivative markets. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.</description>
