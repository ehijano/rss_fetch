      <title>Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation,A Simpler Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous analysis of the Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation proved the best solution is null; although, the method of solution generated complex nested integrals, therefore, difficult to analyze \cite{NWSgen,NWS2020}. Recent insights into the properties of the convolution integral enable considerable simplification of the solution in the codomain, producing much simpler representations. The inverse Fourier transform of the spectral solution proves to be a non-bijective, null solution, therefore, confirming previous suspicions. Alternative representations of the solution, either expansions or Fujita type solutions, all prove the solution to be a null function.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Implicit Lagrange-Poincar\'e Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider reduction of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle formulated on the Pontryagin bundle of a manifold $Q$. We prove that a stochastic action invariant under the free and proper action of a Lie group $G$ drops to a reduced variational principle expressed in terms of variables of the Pontryagin bundle of the reduced space $Q/G$, the associated adjoint bundle $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}:= (Q\times \mathfrak{g})/G$ and its dual bundle $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}^*$. This provides a stochastic analogue of the deterministic implicit Lagrange-Poincar\'e reduction. The stochastic Euler-Lagrange equations drop to a set of stochastic horizontal and vertical Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations on $T(Q/G)\oplus T^*(Q/G)\oplus\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\oplus\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}^*$. As examples, we consider stochastic perturbations of the rigid body with a rotor, as well as a Kaluza-Klein description of stochastic perturbations of a charged particle in a magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an infinite-dimensional version of "quantization commutes with reduction" in the framework of geometric quantization of Chern-Simons gauge theory, focusing on the genus one case. The proof is complex-analytic and relies on the Atiyah-Bott stack and the Chern-Simons line bundle.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Phase-Lag and Geometric Precedence in Turbulent Vortex Stretching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal timeline of vortex stretching in high-Reynolds-number turbulence ($Re_\lambda \approx 433$) using Lagrangian tracking in $1024^3$ direct numerical simulations. While classical theories often assume an instantaneous alignment between strain and vorticity, the present analysis identifies a systematic Lagrangian phase lag governing the onset of intense dissipation. By conditionally averaging the dynamics of fluid parcels, a distinct phase-space hysteresis is revealed. Trajectories are captured by the saddle-point topology of the pressure field ($\lambda_{min}^p &lt; 0$) prior to experiencing peak enstrophy amplification. This temporal ordering ($\tau &gt; 0$) demonstrates that the pressure topology acts as a deterministic geometric precursor, organizing the flow structure before the bursting event occurs. The robustness of this mechanism is verified in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, where the Lorentz force is found to suppress the hysteresis loop, forcing a transition from causal precedence to simultaneous locking.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations in Two-Species Born--Infeld Theories Governing Vortices and Antivortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09091v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive several new Bogomol'nyi (self-dual) equations in two-species $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories governed by the Born--Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.
  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present explicit matrix product operator (MPO) representations for the local conserved quantities of the spin-$1/2$ XYZ chain. Through these MPO representations, we simplify the coefficients appearing in the local conserved quantities originally derived by one of the authors, and reveal their combinatorial meaning: the coefficients prove to be a polynomial generalization of the Catalan numbers, defined via weighted monotonic lattice paths. Furthermore, we obtain a new simple $3 \times 3$ Lax operator for the XYZ chain that, unlike Baxter's R-matrix, does not involve elliptic functions.</description>

      <title>A first passage problem for a Poisson counting process with a linear moving boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time to first crossing for the Poisson counting process with respect to a linear moving barrier with offset is a classic problem, although key results remain scattered across the literature and their equivalence is often unclear. Here we present a unified and pedagogical treatment of two approaches: the direct time-domain approach based on path-decomposition techniques and the Laplace-domain approach based on the Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. Beyond streamlining existing derivations and establishing their consistency, we leverage the complementary nature of the two methods to obtain new exact analytical results. Specifically, we derive an explicit large deviation function for the first-passage time distribution in the subcritical regime and closed-form expressions for the conditional mean first-passage time for arbitrary offset. Despite its simplicity, this first crossing process exhibits non-trivial critical behavior and provides a rare example where all the main results of interest can be derived exactly.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of minimizers for axisymmetric nematic films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nematic surfaces are thin liquid films endowed with in-plane orientational order. We study a variational model in which the nematic director is constrained to lie in the tangent space of an axisymmetric surface, and the associated surface energy accounts for both surface tension and elastic nematic contributions. Here we adopt the surface gradient as the differential operator on the surface, we restrict our analysis to revolution surfaces spanning two coaxial rings, and we assume that the nematic director is aligned along parallels. In this setting, the energy functional reduces to a one-dimensional variational problem. We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers and we provide their complete geometric characterization. Finally, we run some numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Hopf algebra of B-diagrams as an algebra projecting onto the Heisenberg algebra and designed to encode the combinatorics of the bosonic normal-ordering problem. In order to understand and generalize the properties of the algebra of noncommutative symmetric polynomials viewed as a Hopf subalgebra of the Hopf algebra linearly spanned by B-diagrams, we describe and study its dual Hopf algebra. This construction also allows us to establish connections with combinatorial Hopf algebras based on colored set partitions.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}$-transforms for Non-Hermitian Matrices: A Spherical Integral Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between the formalism of $\mathcal{R}$-transforms for non-Hermitian random matrices and the framework of spherical integrals, using the replica method. This connection was previously proved in the Hermitian setting and in the case of bi-invariant random matrices. We show that the $\mathcal{R}$-transforms used in the non-Hermitian context in fact originate from a single scalar function of two variables. This provides a new and transparent way to compute $\mathcal{R}$-transforms, which until now had been known only in restricted cases such as bi-invariant, Hermitian, or elliptic ensembles.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of the Marchenko-Pastur law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a $q$-deformed random unitary ensemble associated with the little-$q$ Laguerre weight, which provides a discrete analogue of the classical Laguerre unitary ensemble. In the double scaling regime $q=e^{-\lambda/N}$, where $N$ is the system size and $\lambda \ge 0$, we derive the limiting spectral distribution as $N\to \infty$, which yields a $q$-deformation of the Marchenko-Pastur law. The limiting density undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly determined critical value $\lambda_c$: for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$, the support consists of a single band region, whereas for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ an additional saturated region emerges adjacent to the band region. Our derivation of the limiting distribution is based on three complementary approaches: the method of moments, the analysis of a constrained equilibrium problem, and the asymptotic zero distribution of orthogonal polynomials. As a consequence, we establish the convergence of the empirical measure as well as a large deviation principle. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for the spectral moments using the combinatorial structure of orthogonal polynomials, and obtain large-$N$ expansions for these moments.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion with soft constraints in soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff forces, which bind objects together or otherwise confine motion, are found widely in soft-matter systems - colloids with short range attractions, ligand-receptor contacts, particles in optical traps, fibres that resist stretching, etc. To assess the long-term effect of these stiff forces on dynamics and structure, it is useful to consider the limit where they are treated as constraints, so the system evolves strictly within allowed configurations. Efforts to derive equations involving both constraints, and the stochastic motion appropriate at the scales of soft matter, began around 50 years ago, yet, we are still lacking a straightforward way to extract the projected equations and apply them in modern formulations of mesoscale dynamics. Here, we address this gap with two key contributions: (1) a practical summary of the constrained Brownian dynamics equations with ``soft'' constraints, i.e. constraints imposed by stiff forces, which is illustrated through several representative examples, taking care to highlight the nontrivial effects of the constraints; and (2) a novel derivation using singular perturbation theory, establishing the validity of these equations over timescales exceeding the relaxation of stiffly constrained degrees of freedom. We further extend our approach to ``soft soft'' constraints, where mobility varies on lengthscales comparable to the restraining forces - a scenario typical for particles in fluids experiencing hydrodynamic interactions. We hope our results will be useful for soft matter research, as a robust toolkit for studying tethered or confined systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Eigenvalue Problems, Floquet Isospectrality and the Hilbert--Chow Morphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When can one change the diagonal of a matrix without changing its spectrum? We completely answer this question over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or larger than the size of the matrix: An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ admits a nonzero diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A$ and $A+D$ have the same spectrum if and only if, for some size $k$, the $k \times k$ principal minors of $A$ are not all equal. This relates to the classical additive inverse eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis and has implications for existence and rigidity results in the theory of Floquet isospectrality of discrete periodic operators in solid state physics. The proof employs new techniques involving Hilbert schemes of points and the infinitesimal structure of the Hilbert--Chow morphism.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs of homomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We show that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also show that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel, answering a question of Daws.</description>

      <title>A reconstruction theorem for Connes-Landi deformations of commutative spectral triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:1408.4429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and prove an extension of Connes's reconstruction theorem for commutative spectral triples to so-called Connes-Landi or isospectral deformations of commutative spectral triples along the action of a compact Abelian Lie group $G$, also known as toric noncommutative manifolds. In particular, we propose an abstract definition for such spectral triples, where noncommutativity is entirely governed by a deformation parameter sitting in the second group cohomology of the Pontrjagin dual of $G$, and then show that such spectral triples are well-behaved under further Connes-Landi deformation, thereby allowing for both quantisation from and dequantisation to $G$-equivariant abstract commutative spectral triples. We then use a refinement of the Connes-Dubois-Violette splitting homomorphism to conclude that suitable Connes-Landi deformations of commutative spectral triples by a rational deformation parameter are almost-commutative in the general, topologically non-trivial sense.</description>

      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>R-matrix valued Lax pair for elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system and associative Yang-Baxter equations of ${\rm BC}_n$ type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system of ${\rm BC}_n$ type with five arbitrary constants and propose $R$-matrix valued generalization for $2n\times 2n$ Takasaki's Lax pair. For this purpose we extend the Kirillov's ${\rm B}$-type associative Yang-Baxter equations to the similar relations depending on the spectral parameters and the Planck constants. General construction uses the elliptic Shibukawa-Ueno $R$-operator and the Komori-Hikami $K$-operators satisfying reflection equation. Then, using the Felder-Pasquier construction the answer for the Lax pair is also written in terms of the Baxter's 8-vertex $R$-matrix. As a by-product of the constructed Lax pair we also propose ${\rm BC}_n$ type generalization for the elliptic XYZ long-range spin chain, and we present arguments pointing to its integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalization of a bosonic quadratic Hamiltonian with an ultraviolet divergence. The Hamiltonian is composed of the sum of a free part and the square of the smeared field operator. We explicitly diagonalize the Hamiltonian via Bogoliubov transformations, thus simplifying its definition as a self-adjoint operator. Depending on the field operator's smearing, we discuss different renormalizations, either of the energy alone, or the energy and coupling constant together.</description>

      <title>Reversibility in finite-dimensional collapse dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite dimensional quantum systems with arbitrary collapse events, establishing, under no-information-erasure conditions, a structural no-go for trajectory-level operational irreversibility. More precisely, we prove that, for every physically admissible selector of the collapse dynamics, there exists a topologically closed, forward-invariant subset of the projective state space on which any two states can be connected with arbitrarily fine Fubini-Study precision and arbitrarily small integrated energetic cost. This shows that the preservation of information along a realized branch of outcomes guarantees islands of quasi-reversibility, while genuine irreversibility requires additional ingredients such as non-compactness or information erasure.

      <title>Classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model: relation to Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat and 1-site classical XYZ model with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a description of the classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 8 independent coupling constants through a pair of ${\rm BC}_1$ type classical Sklyanin algebras generated by the (classical) quadratic reflection equation with non-dynamical XYZ $r$-matrix. For this purpose, we consider the classical version of the $L$-operator for the Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model proposed by O. Chalykh. In ${\rm BC}_1$ case it is factorized to the product of two Lax matrices depending on 4 constants. Then we apply an IRF-Vertex type gauge transformation and obtain a product of the Lax matrices for the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostats. Each of them is described by the ${\rm BC}_1$ version of the classical Sklyanin algebra. In particular case, when 4 pairs of constants coincide, the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model exactly coincides with the relativistic Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat. Explicit change of variables is obtained. We also consider another special case of the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 7 independent constants. We show that it can be reproduced by considering the transfer matrix of the classical 1-site XYZ chain with boundaries. In the end of the paper, using another gauge transformation we represent the Chalykh's Lax matrix in a form depending on the Sklyanin's generators.</description>

      <title>Mixing times for the TASEP on the circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mixing times for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a circle of length $N$ with $k$ particles. We show that the mixing time is of order $N^2 \min(k,N-k)^{-1/2}$, and that the cutoff phenomenon does not occur. This confirms behavior which was separately predicted by Jara, Lacoin and Peres, and it is more broadly believed to hold for integrable models in the KPZ-universalty class. Our arguments rely on a connection to periodic last passage percolation with a detailed analysis of flat geodesics, as well as a novel random extension and time shift argument for last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence for Vertex Operator Superalgebras from Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a smooth affine algebraic group $G$, one can attach various D-module categories to it that admit convolution monoidal structure. We consider the derived category of D-modules on $G$, the stack $G/G_{ad}$ and the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules. Combining the work of Beilinson-Drinfeld on D-modules and Hecke patterns with the recent work of the author with Dimofte and Py, we show that each of the above categories (more precisely the equivariant version) is monoidal equivalent to a localization of the DG category of modules of a graded Hopf algebra. As a consequence, we give an explicit braided monoidal structure to the derived category of D-modules on $G/G_{ad}$, which when restricted to the heart, recovers the braiding of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Ostrik.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Backgrounds and Background Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with an algebraic extension of the causal wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6</description>

      <title>van den Berg-Kesten--type correlation inequalities for disjoint polymers in the KPZ universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical percolation theory, the van den Berg-Kesten (BK) inequality is a fundamental tool that shows that disjoint events induce negative conditionings on each other. The inequality also holds in the context of last passage percolation (LPP), which is the zero temperature limit of polymer models and an important subclass in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Recently, an analog of the BK inequality was discovered in the context of zero temperature line ensembles and the scaling limit of LPP, where it was used to study upper tail probabilities of the weight and the scaling limit of geodesics under such upper tail conditionings. However, while it has become apparent that such an inequality in the positive temperature setting would have a number of applications, it seems likely that a direct generalization of the zero temperature inequality would not hold. In this work we prove a version of the BK inequality for the KPZ line ensemble and the continuum directed random polymer. We do so by working with the log gamma polymer, making use of its integrability and the geometric RSK correspondence. Our inequality serves as a key input in analyzing the KPZ line ensemble and proving sharp upper tail estimates of the KPZ equation in arXiv:2208.08922, and proving convergence of the continuum directed random polymer to Brownian bridge under the upper tail event in arXiv:2311.12009. The crucial role of integrability in the validity of such an inequality is highlighted via a counter-example for a non-integrable model.</description>

Abstract: The partition functions of ferromagnetic Ising models of square lattices in a finite magnetic field is deduced using topological considerations within a heuristic graph-theoretical approach. These equations are derived separately for low and high temperature regimes while the exact solution of Onsager is obtained therefrom when the magnetic field is zero. The derived partition function equations here are almost similar to those given by Onsager, thus indicating a straight-forward protocol, even when the magnetic field is present. The spontaneous magnetization derived here using the Helmholtz free energy is identical with that arising from the exact solution. The partition functions lead to the known series expansions of the magnetization and zero-field susceptibility.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Penalization Method for the Single-species Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck Equation</title>

Abstract: The Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck (RFP) equation describes Coulomb collisional dynamics within and across species in plasmas. It belongs to the broader class of anisotropic-diffusion-advection equations, whose numerical approximation is highly-nontrivial due to its nonlinearity, stiffness, and structural properties such as conservation and entropy dissipation (hence with the Maxwellian distribution as the equilibrium state). In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving penalization scheme for the stiff, single-species RFP equation. The scheme features three novel components: 1) a novel generalization of the well-known Chang-Cooper discretization for the RFP equation that is equilibrium-preserving and enables positivity while preserving mass, momentum, and energy; 2) an easy-to-invert isotropic variable-coefficient penalization operator to deal with the temporal stiffness without resorting to a fully implicit scheme, borrowing ideas from explicit-implicit-null (EIN) methods, and 3) an adaptive timestepping strategy that preserves the positivity of the full penalized scheme. The resulting scheme conserves mass, momentum, and energy strictly, is unconditionally stable, and robustly positivity preserving. The scheme is demonstrated with linear and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion examples of increasing complexity, including several single-species RFP examples.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for General Systems of Isentropic Gas Dynamics via a Weighted Pressure Perturbation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global existence of bounded entropy solutions to the one-dimensional system of isentropic gas dynamics with general pressure laws, allowing for the presence of vacuum states. We introduce a novel regularization scheme based on a \textbf{weighted pressure perturbation} designed to enforce acoustic degeneracy at a cut-off density $\rho=\delta$. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the \textbf{strict preservation of the mass conservation law}, in contrast to previous regularization methods that require modifying the continuity equation. We prove that the perturbed pressure $\tilde{P}$ exactly inherits the convexity structure of the original equation of state (satisfying $2\tilde{P}'+\rho\tilde{P}'' = 2P'+\rho P''$), thereby ensuring the strict convexity of the mechanical entropy without auxiliary transformations. This structural preservation allows for the direct application of the Chueh-Conley-Smoller theory to establish uniform $L^\infty$ bounds via invariant regions. The convergence to a global weak solution in the vanishing regularization limit is finally proved using the method of compensated compactness and a singular analysis of the entropy equation near the vacuum.</description>
