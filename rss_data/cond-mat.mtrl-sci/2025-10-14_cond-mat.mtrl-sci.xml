      <title>Ensemble-Based Data Assimilation for Material Model Characterization in High-Velocity Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations are essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of materials under high-velocity impact (HVI) in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, their accuracy relies on material models and parameters that are traditionally obtained through manual fitting to multiple time- and labor-intensive experiments. This study presents an ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) framework to automatically and simultaneously calibrate plasticity, fracture, and equation of state (EOS) parameters from a single HVI test. The framework integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for HVI simulations, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for parameter refinement, and adaptive covariance inflation to mitigate uncertainty underestimation. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic back-face deflection data from an AZ31B magnesium plate to identify Johnson-Cook plasticity/fracture and Mie-Gruneisen EOS parameters. Test cases with biased initial guesses and limited data show the EnKF-based framework accurately recovers sensitive parameters in few iterations, indicated by a convergent ensemble standard deviation. Conversely, insensitive parameters converge to incorrect values with persistently large standard deviations. Limited observational data can still achieve convergence but requires more iterations. Under extreme prior bias, sensitive parameters may exhibit a drift-then-stall behavior with small residual biases. In practice, the ensemble standard deviation thus provides a diagnostic tool to assess parameter sensitivity and calibration accuracy. This study demonstrates the proposed DA framework is a robust and efficient tool for HVI material model characterization.</description>

      <title>Dipole Alignment and Layered Flow Structure in Pressure-Driven Water Transport through MoS$_{2}$ Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient water transport through nanostructure membranes is essential for advancing filtration and desalination technologies. In this study, we investigate the flow of water through molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_{2}$) nanopores of varying diameters using molecular dynamics simulations. The results demonstrate that both pore size and atomic edge composition play crucial roles in regulating water flux, molecular organization, and dipole orientation. Larger pores facilitate the formation of layered water structures and promote edge-accelerated flow, driven by strong electrostatic interactions between water molecules and exposed molybdenum atoms. In narrower pores, confinement and asymmetric edge chemistry induce the ordered alignment of dipoles, thereby enhancing directional transport. Velocity and density maps reveal that pore edges act as active zones, concentrating flow and reducing resistance. These findings highlight the significance of pore geometry, surface chemistry, and molecular dynamics in influencing water behavior within MoS$_{2}$ membranes, providing valuable insights for the design of advanced nanofluidic and water purification systems.</description>

      <title>Rotation of crystal seed during early stages of growth reveals the anisotropy of glass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation of crystal seed during the early stages of growth in a glass matrix has been observed due to some torque, contradicting the expectations from the isotropic, uniform structure of the surrounding amorphous matrix. We establish an atomistic origin of this new phenomenon from molecular dynamics simulations using LiNbO3 and LiNbO3-SiO2 glasses as model systems. Effectively, it arises due to non-uniform forces on the seed from the surrounding glass, which appears inhomogeneous and anisotropic on the scale of glass-crystal interface. The seeded crystal growth (SCG) at higher temperatures amplifies this effect due to enhanced atomic dynamics. Silica, when added to LiNbO3 glass, reduces the crystal growth rate due to increased viscosity and restricted atomic mobility across the growth interface, but has minimal effect on the crystal rotation. These findings challenge a general assumption that glass is an isotropic material, especially during the early stage of its crystallization, and provide insights for tailoring the microstructure of widely used glass-ceramics.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall effect in the high-resistivity high-entropy alloy AlCrMoW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thin films of the high-entropy alloy system Al$_{x}$(CrMoW)$_{1-x}$, grown on Ta seed layers by magnetron co-sputtering. Between $x=0.2$ and $x=0.6$, a resistivity larger than 100$\mu\Omega$cm is achieved, with a peak of 180$\mu\Omega$cm at $x=0.5$. Around the stoichiometric composition AlCrMoW, the alloy forms a bcc solid solution. The harmonic Hall method was used to characterize the spin Hall angle of the alloy series, where a maximum spin Hall angle of $\theta = -0.12 \pm 0.01$ is observed for $x=0.25$. The implied spin Hall conductivity is $\sigma_\mathrm{SH} \approx -72\,000 \, \hbar/(2e)$\,S/m. The experimental results show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations, which show similar trends and values. The results demonstrate that high-entropy alloys with a main-group element component can form a simple crystal structure and show high resistivity. This suggests that a whole new class of materials for spin Hall device engineering is available with simple methods.</description>

      <title>Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Crystal Structures and Ionic Conductivity in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ Halide Solid Electrolytes Using a Fine-Tuned Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential (uMLIP) to investigate ionic transport mechanisms in ternary halide solid electrolytes of the Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ family (x = 0 to 6), which are promising candidates for solid-state battery applications. We present a strategy for generating ordered structural models from experimentally derived disordered Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6}$ (LYC) and Li$_{3}$YBr$_{6}$ (LYB) structures. These serve as initial configurations for an iterative fine-tuning workflow that couples molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with static density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The fine-tuning process and the resulting improvements in predictive accuracy are benchmarked across energy predictions, structure optimizations, and diffusion coefficient calculations. Finally, we analyze the influence of composition (varied x) on the predicted ionic conductivity in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$, demonstrating the robustness of our approach for modeling transport properties in complex solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Triggered Amorphization Enables High-Performance Solid-State Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) hold great promise for advancing the application of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), owing to their favorable ionic conductivity, structural tunability, and promising electrochemical performance. However, the absence of universal design principles for amorphous SSEs limits their development. By fundamentally re-evaluating the amorphization-forming ability of amorphous SSE systems, this study establishes a nitrogen-driven universal strategy to convert diverse metal chlorides into amorphous xLi3N-MCly (0.3 &lt; 3x &lt; 1.9; M denotes a metal element; 2 &lt; y &lt; 5) SSE. Nitrogen synergistically disrupts crystalline order via distorted coordination polyhedra and N-bridged networks, while dynamic bond reorganization enables rapid Li+ migration, achieving ionic conductivity of 2.02 mS cm-1 for 0.533Li3N-HfCl4 at 25 {\deg}C. Structural-property relationships reveal that high charge density and bridging capability of N3- enhance network disorder, shorten metal coordinating atom distances, and optimize Li+ diffusion pathway connectivity. ASSBs employing 0.533Li3N-HfCl4 retain 81.87% capacity after 2000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 with high cathode loading (6.24 mg cm-2), demonstrating engineering viability. This work provides a paradigm for rational design of high-performance amorphous SSEs.</description>

      <title>Relationship among Structural, Disordered, Magnetism and Band Topology in MnSb2Te4(Sb2Te3)n Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplay between topology and magnetism induces various exotic quantum phenomena, with magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) serving as a prominent example due to their ability to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). However, the realization of QAHE at higher temperature approaching magnetic-transition-temperature remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable material platforms and limited understanding of the intricate relationships between band topology, magnetism, and defects. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of MnSb2Te4(Sb2Te3)n (n = 0 - 5) single crystals, including the discovery of novel MnSb8Te13 pure phase. Experimental measurements confirm that MnSb8Te13 exhibits ferromagnetism and features topologically nontrivial electronic structures, characterized by a Dirac point located further from the conduction band and a possible larger bulk gap compared to MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n (n = 0 - 3). Moreover, we systematically analyze the relationship between structure, magnetism, topology, and disorder within Mn(Sb, Bi)2Te4((Sb, Bi)2Te3)n family. Present work will shed light on the exploration of potential platforms capable of achieving QAHE near magnetic transition temperature, offering new directions for advancing topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Ambient-Stable Transfer-Free Graphdiyne Wafers with Superhigh Hole Mobility at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphdiyne (GDY) is recognized as a compelling candidate for the fabrication of next-generation high-speed low-energy electronic devices due to its inherent p-type semiconductor characteristics. However, the development of GDY for applications in field-effect transistors (FETs), complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), and logic devices remains constrained by the relatively low carrier mobility reported in current experimental studies. Herein, the synthesis of layer-controlled hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) films directly on silicon substrates under a supercritical CO2 atmosphere is reported, along with the fabrication of these films into HsGDY-based FETs. The transfer-free growth strategy eliminates performance degradation caused by post-synthesis transfer processes. The resulting HsGDY FETs exhibit a remarkable hole mobility of up to 3800 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room-temperature, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of most p-type semiconductors. The synthesis of transfer-free HsGDY wafers provides a new strategy for resolving the carrier mobility mismatch between p-channel and n-channel two-dimensional metal-oxide-semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Magnetic Correlations in La2Mn2-xNixO6: Role of Crystal Structure in Double Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic correlations in double perovskites La2Mn2-xNixO6 (x = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5) have been systematically investigated across macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic length scales using temperature-dependent bulk DC magnetization, neutron depolarization, and neutron powder diffraction measurements, respectivitly. The magnetic properties evolve from a long-range ferromagnetic (FM) order to a cluster ferromagnetic or spin-glass (FM or SG) behavior as the Ni concentration increases. This evolution is directly linked to changes in the crystal structure, transitioning from pure orthorhombic (x=0.5) to mixed orthorhombic and monoclinic (x=0.75-1.0), and eventually to mixed trigonal and monoclinic symmetries (x=1.25-1.5). Ni substitution enhances the magnetic ordering temperature from 170 K (x=0.5) to 280 K (x=1.0), but this is accompanied by a reduction in both magnetization and ordered magnetic moment. Beyond x=1.0, any long-range magnetic ordering is absent. Additionally, all compositions exhibit a reentrant spin-glass-like phase at low temperatures (below about 50 K). Neutron diffraction analysis confirms that long-range FM order occurs only in the orthorhombic phase, while the monoclinic and trigonal phases lack such magnetic ordering. The temperature-dependent magnetic correlations are closely connected to variations in crystal structural parameters, including lattice constants and unit cell volume. The electrical conductivity behavior, following the variable range hopping (VRH) model, highlights the role of multivalence Mn and Ni ions on the electrical properties. This study elucidates the microscopic mechanisms behind the tunable magnetic and electrical properties of La2Mn2-xNixO6, offering valuable insights for the design of advanced materials for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Atomic bonding in equilibrium single-component melts. The cases of arsenic, antimony and bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In liquid pnictogens, quasi-stable structures can be formed near melting temperature. The nature of their stability does not have the unified point of view. In the present work, the task of determining the degree of atomic bonding in these structures is solved using the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) method. The original results of ab-initio simulation of arsenic, antimony and bismuth melts near their melting temperatures are used. It is shown that the features of the electron interaction at the level of $p$-orbitals determine the characteristic bond lengths and angles between atoms. It has been established that the stability of structures decreases according to a power law with an increase in the atomic mass of a chemical element and the number of atoms in the structure. The obtained results clarify the understanding the mechanisms of formation of quasi-stable structures in pnictogen melts from first principles.</description>

      <title>A continued fraction approximation for the effective elasticity tensor of two-dimensional polycrystals as a function of the crystal elasticity tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two-dimensional polycrystals the effective elasticity tensor $C_*$ as a function $C_*(C_0)$ of the elasticity tensor $C_0$ of the constituent crystal is considered. It is shown that this function can be approximated by one with a continued fraction expansion resembling that associated with a class of microstructure known as sequential laminates. These are hierarchical microstructures defined inductively. Rank 0 sequential laminates are simply rotations of the pure crystal. Rank $j$ sequential laminates are obtained by laminating together, on a length scale much larger that the existing microstructure and with interfaces perpendicular to some direction $n_j$, rank $j-1$ sequential laminates with a rotation of the pure crystal. The continued fraction approximation for arbitrary polycrystal microstructures typically takes a more general form than that of sequential laminates, but has some free parameters. It is an open question as to whether these free parameters can always be adjusted so the continued fraction approximation matches exactly that of a sequential laminate. If so, one would have established that the elastic response of two-dimensional polycrystals can always be mimicked by that of sequential laminates. Our analysis carries over to the more general case where the strain is replaced by a field $E(x)$ that is the gradient of a vector potential $u(x)$, i.e. $E=\nabla u$ and the stress is replaced by a matrix valued field $J(x)$ that need not be symmetric but has zero divergence $\nabla\cdot J=0$. The tensor $L(x)$ entering the constitutive relation $J=L E$ is locally a rotation of the tensor $L_0$ of the pure crystal that need not have any special symmetries and has 16 independent tensor elements.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Origins of Oxidation Resistance in Amorphous Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous boron nitride (\textrm{$\alpha$}-BN) is a promising ultrathin barrier for nanoelectronics, yet the atomistic mechanisms governing its chemical stability remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the structure-property relationship that dictates the oxidation of \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN using a combination of machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The simulations reveal that the film structure, controlled by synthesis conditions, is the critical factor determining oxidation resistance. Dense, chemically ordered networks with a high fraction of B-N bonds effectively resist oxidation by confining it to the surface, whereas porous, defect-rich structures with abundant homonuclear B-B and N-N bonds permit oxygen penetration and undergo extensive bulk degradation. These computational findings are consistent with experimental trends observed in \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN films grown by chemical vapour deposition. XPS analysis shows that a film grown at a higher temperature develops a more ordered structure with a B/N ratio nearer to stoichiometric and exhibits superior resistance to surface oxidation compared to its more defective, lower-temperature counterpart. Together, these results demonstrate that the oxidation resistance of \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN is a tunable property directly linked to its atomic-scale morphology, providing a clear framework for engineering chemically robust dielectric barriers for future nanoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Electric Polarization-Driven Modulation of Fe Adatoms on Ferroelectric $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay among structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Fe adatoms on the surface of two-dimensional ferroelectric {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$ is investigated using first-principles electronic structure calculations, with a focus on how these properties are modulated by the direction of the electric polarization of the substrate. We identify two competing adsorption sites for Fe adatoms, whose relative stability depends on the adatom concentration and can be reversed by switching the electric polarization of {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$. The calculated energy barrier for thermally activated hopping between these sites is approximately 0.4 eV, corresponding to a blocking temperature of around 100 K. The hybridization between Fe and In$_2$Se$_3$ orbitals strongly depends on the adsorption site and polarization direction, driven by variations in the local adatom geometry. As a result, the electronic configuration of adatom, magnetic moment, and magnetic anisotropy exhibit a pronounced site dependence and can be effectively modulated by switching the electric polarization of the In$_2$Se$_3$ layer. In particular, at higher adatom concentrations, an exceptionally large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, exceeding 200 meV per Fe atom, emerges for one polarization direction, but is largely diminished when the polarization is reversed. These findings indicate that ferroelectric substrates offer a promising route for voltage-controlled tuning of magnetic adatom properties via reversible polarization switching.</description>

      <title>Growth control of highly textured Bi2Te3 thin films by pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials have attracted growing interest due to their unique electronic properties and potential applications in spintronics. Interfacing strongly spin-orbit-coupled chalcogenides with functional oxides such as perovskites has a particularly high potential. In this work, highly textured Bi2Te3 thin films were deposited on (111) oriented SrTiO3 by pulsed laser deposition. We show that, by careful selection of the temperature and pressure of growth, the film's stoichiometry can be manipulated between direct stoichiometry transfer from the target and tellurium-deficient phases. Optimized pulsed laser deposition enables the growth of films with coalesced, faceted grains with grain sizes reaching up to 430 nm, while preserving crystalline quality comparable to that of molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown films. We show striking differences arising from tuning the laser's pulsing frequency and fluence, which lead to changes in surface roughness, the film's porosity, and grain boundaries, as well as grain shape. Analysis of cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images reveals a sharp substrate-film interface without atomic intermixing and without the formation of amorphous intermediate layers. The results demonstrate that pulsed laser deposition is a viable method for producing high-quality Bi2Te3 thin films and opens the door to the integration of chalcogenides with perovskites with this growth technique.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Strain Engineering in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/LaFeO3 Superlattice: Structural Relaxation and Domain Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic strain engineering in epitaxial oxide films provides new opportunities to control the antiferromagnetic and structural properties crucial for advancements of antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here we report on a (La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/LaFeO3)4 superlattice grown on (101)o DyScO3 substrate which imposes significant anisotropic in-plane strain. Reciprocal space mapping reveals selective strain relaxation along the tensile in-plane [010]o axis, while compression along the perpendicular in-plane [-101]o axis remains strained. Scanning precession electron diffraction and higher-order Laue zone analysis show that the relaxation is accommodated by structural domain formation in the LaFeO3 layers, initiating from the second bilayer and propagating out-of-plane. These domains minimise structural defects and correlate with the substrate step edges. X-ray magnetic dichroism measurements reveal bulk-like in-plane antiferromagnetic order with polydomain signature as previously reported. Our findings reveal the presence of structural domains coexisting with antiferromagnetic polydomain states, showing a strain-domain-magnetism relationship that provides insights for applications of strain engineering in spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Structural Duality of Graphene Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous in large-scale graphene samples, playing a crucial role in their overall performance. Due to their complexity, they are usually investigated as model structures, under the assumption of a fully relaxed interface. Here, we present cantilever-based non-contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) as a suitable technique to resolve, atom by atom, the complete structure of these linear defects. Our experimental findings reveal a richer scenario than expected, with the coexistence of energetically stable and metastable graphene GBs. Although both GBs are structurally composed of pentagonal and heptagonal like rings, they can be differentiated by the irregular geometric shapes present in the metastable boundaries. Theoretical modeling and simulated ncAFM images, accounting for the experimental data, show that metastable GBs form under compressive uniaxial strain and exhibit vertical corrugation, whereas stable GBs remain in a fully relaxed, flat configuration. By locally introducing energy with the AFM tip, we show the possibility to manipulate the metastable GBs, driving them toward their minimum energy configuration. Notably, our high-resolution ncAFM images reveal a clear dichotomy: while the structural distortions of metastable grain boundaries are confined to just a few atoms, their impact on graphene's properties extends over significantly larger length scales.</description>

      <title>A ferroelectric junction transistor memory made from switchable van der Waals p-n heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) p-n heterojunctions are important building blocks for advanced electronics and optoelectronics, in which high-quality heterojunctions essentially determine device performances or functionalities. Creating tunable depletion regions with substantially suppressed leakage currents presents huge challenges, but is crucial for heterojunction applications. Here, by using band-aligned p-type SnSe and n-type ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 as a model, we report near-ideal multifunctional vdW p-n heterojunctions with small reverse leakage currents (0.1 pA) and a desired diode ideality factor (1.95). As-fabricated junction transistors exhibit superior performance, such as a high on/off ratio of over 105. Importantly, we realize ferroelectric-tuned band alignment with a giant barrier modulation of 900 meV. Based on such tunable heterojunctions, we propose and demonstrate a fundamental different device termed ferroelectric junction field-effect transistor memory, which shows large memory windows (1.8 V), ultrafast speed (100 ns), high operation temperature (393 K), and low cycle-to-cycle variation (2 %). Additionally, the reliable synaptic characteristics of these memory devices promise low-power neuromorphic computing. Our work provides a new device platform with switchable memory heterojunctions, applicable to high performance brain-inspired electronics and optoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: Magnets with controllable magnetization and high critical temperature are essential for practical spintronics devices, among which the two-dimensional 1T-CrTe2 stands out because of its high experimental critical temperature up to about 300K down to the single layer limit. By using ab initio density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer 1T-CrTe2 and demonstrate that the magnetic properties, such as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, critical Curie temperature and magnetizations, can be influenced by strain or electric fields.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Sabatier Principle by Dynamic Adsorption-Desorption Decoupling in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sabatier principle establishes a fundamental trade-off in heterogeneous electrocatalysis.In the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), this trade-off is manifested by the coupling of Volmer step, which requires strong hydrogen adsorption, with the Heyrovsky/Tafel step, which favors facile desorption, thus giving rise to the classical volcano relationship and limiting activity even at $\Delta G=0$. Here, we demonstrate a ferroelectric platform with dynamic tunability -- monolayer GeS$_2$ decorated with transition metal atoms as a proof-of-concept -- where polarization-driven surface electronic reconstruction enables real-time modulation of intermediate binding strength, thereby breaking the Sabatier constraint. Reversible control of hydrogen adsorption allows strong H binding to accelerate the Volmer step, followed by weakened adsorption to promote the Heyrovsky/Tafel step.This dynamic adsorption-desorption decoupling not only surpasses the volcano limit to achieve unprecedented HER activity, but also establishes a general paradigm for designing adaptive electrocatalysts capable of reconfiguring under operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Weak-anti-localization-to-spin-dependent scattering at a proximity-magnetized heavy metal interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A change in a materials electrical resistance with magnetic field (magnetoresistance) results from quantum interference effects and, or spin-dependent transport, depending on materials properties and dimensionality. In disordered conductors, electron interference leads to weak localization or anti-localization; in contrast, ferromagnetic conductors support spin-dependent scattering, leading to giant magnetoresistance (GMR). By varying the thickness of Au between 4 and 28 nm in a EuS/Au/EuS spin-switches, we observe a crossover from weak anti-localization to interfacial GMR. The crossover is related to a magnetic proximity effect in Au due to electron scattering at the insulating EuS interface. The proximity-induced exchange field in Au suppresses weak anti-localization, consistent with Maekawa-Fukuyama theory. With increasing Au thickness, GMR emerges along with spin Hall magnetoresistance. These findings demonstrate spin transport governed by interfacial exchange fields, building a framework for spintronic functionality without metallic magnetism.</description>

Abstract: Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are discovered to conform to surfaces of given charge density distributions embedded in crystals [Z. Kristallogr. \textbf{170}, 138 (1985)]. Based on our previous work [Phys. Rev. Mater. \textbf{9}, 073802 (2025)], we discovered that crystals can have surfaces of a given charge density converging to TPMS. We also discovered that end states connected by a martensitic phase transformation should have their corresponding TPMS being topologically equivalent. In this work, we gave an explanation for the topological continuity of a martensitic phase transformation and studied how TPMS indicate whether a non-magnetic crystal can undergo a martensitic phase transformation or not.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recently synthesized hexagonal layered phase of FeF$_2$, we studied the magnetic properties of the 1T-FeF$_2$ monolayer and its Janus Fe$X$F ($X$ = O, S) derivatives by first-principles calculations. Our results confirm that these materials are antiferromagnetic semiconductors, and that anion substitution effectively tunes their material properties: the band gap shifts from 3.37 eV (direct, FeF$_2$) to 2.35 eV (direct, FeOF) and 1.13 eV (indirect, FeSF); the magnetic moment of Fe ions increases; and the N\'{e}el temperature ($T_N$) rises dramatically to 248 K (FeSF) and 207 K (FeOF). Janus structures exhibit enhanced magnetic moment and direct AFM coupling. Under compression, $T_N$ is further optimized to 274 K ($-2$\% strain, FeSF) and 244 K ($-5$\% strain, FeOF). Both Janus materials retain their semiconducting nature and direction of easy magnetization axis under $\pm5$\% strain. This study validates the Janus structure as a viable approach to enhance 2D antiferromagnetism and highlights Fe-based oxyhalides as promising spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Ultra-transient grating spectroscopy for visualization of surface acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasonic wave propagation across material surfaces reveals essential information about the materials' elastic behavior. The elastodynamic response of the surface is characterized by the Green's function that fully captures all its direction-dependent and frequency-dependent features. Here we present the first direct experimental visualization of the Green's function, including all its complex details resulting from elastic anisotropy. We achieve this visualization using a dedicated modification of transient grating spectroscopy (TGS), which is a method otherwise well established for measuring Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves. To overcome the limitations of conventional TGS, we explore near-field thermoacoustic phenomena occurring within TGS experiments. We reveal that, along with the transient standing-wave patterns that diminish within hundreds of nanoseconds, there also emerge ultra-transient oscillations with lifetimes at least an order of magnitude shorter. These ultra-transient effects enable capturing the surface acoustic response with exceptional detail, and the resulting experimental angular dispersion maps strikingly replicate the theoretical Green's functions. By utilizing this feature, ultra-transient grating spectroscopy (UTGS) becomes a powerful new tool for detailed contactless characterization of anisotropic solids, opening new pathways for studying single-crystalline materials utilized in diverse modern application fields, including solid-state cooling via the elastocaloric effect, magnetoelastic devices, or nanoscale electromechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of two-dimensional epitaxial materials on industrially relevant substrates is critical for enabling their scalable synthesis and integration into next-generation technologies. Here we present a comprehensive study of the molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium selenide on 2-inch c-plane sapphire substrates. Using in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), in-situ Raman spectroscopy, optical and scanning electron microscopies, we construct a diagram of the gallium selenide growth modes as a function of substrate temperature (530-650 {\deg}C) and Se/Ga flux ratio (5-110). The growth mode diagram reveals distinct regimes, including the growth of layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide GaSe with an unstrained in-plane lattice constant of 0.371$\pm$0.001 nm and a partial epitaxial alignment on sapphire. This work demonstrates a RHEED-based pathway for synthesizing gallium selenide of specific phase and morphology, and the construction of a phase diagram for high vapor pressure III-VI compounds that can be applied to a wide range of other metal chalcogenide materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background (solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structures and properties of moire patterns in twisted bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials are known to depend sensitively on twist angle, yet their dependence on stacking order remains comparatively underexplored. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate the combined effects of stacking order and rotation in MoS2 bilayers. Beginning from five well-established high-symmetry bilayer stackings, we apply twist angles between 1 and 120 to the top layer, revealing a variety of relaxed moire structures. Our results show that the initial stacking significantly influences the moire domain configurations that emerge at a given twist angle. While all five stacking orders are metastable without twist, they form two moire-equivalent classes- AA/AB and AA',A'B,AB', i.e., for a given twist angle, structures within each class relax to the same moire configuration. Specifically, initial AA and AB stackings give rise to triangular ferroelectric domains near 0+/-3, while AA', A'B, and AB' stackings produce triangular ferroelectric domains near 60+/-3. At precisely 60 and 120 twists, the bilayers relax to into pure high-symmetry stackings, highlighting the rotational relationships between these configurations and explaining the shift of 60 in the ferroelectric rotational range. These findings demonstrate the critical role of stacking order in governing the rich moire landscapes accessible in twistronic systems.</description>

      <title>Delayed 1T to 2H Phase Transition Upon Electrochemical Delithiation of LiMoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a widely studied layered material for electronic, optical, and catalytic applications. It can host lithium ions between the van der Waals layers, which triggers a phase transition between the semiconducting 2H phase and metallic 1T phase. While lithium insertion triggers a phase transition to the 1T phase, the phase behavior upon electrochemical lithium removal is not resolved. In this work, we conduct single-flake electrochemical (de)lithiation of MoS2 using microelectrode arrays. Through both electrochemical voltage analysis and correlative Raman spectroscopy, we show that an electrochemically cycled and delithiated MoS2 flake initially remains in the 1T phase. However, over the course of several days, it transitions back into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase. This result resolves the phase transformation pathway upon delithiation and showcases the ability to electrochemically synthesize the metastable 1T-MoS2 phase.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum limits of electrical contact resistance and thermal boundary resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of electrical contact resistance and thermal boundary resistance has increased dramatically as devices are scaled to atomic limits. The use of a rich range of materials with various bandstructures (e.g. parabolic, conical), and in geometries exploiting various dimensionalities (e.g. 1D wires, 2D sheets, and 3D bulk) will increase in the future. Here we derive a single general expression for the quantum limit of electrical contact resistivity for various bandstructures and all dimensions. A corresponding result for the quantum limit of thermal boundary resistance is also derived. These results will be useful to quantitatively co-design, benchmark, and guide the lowering of electrical and thermal boundary resistances for energy efficient devices.</description>

      <title>Frenkel anomaly on co-ordination numbers in liquid CO2 at 100 and 1000 bar studied by Monte Carlo simulation using Kihara potential model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An issue concerning the Frenkel line of liquid CO2 is that its location has not been unequivocally determined. So far, reliable Frenkel lines were identified from velocity autocorrelation functions (VAFs) computed by Molecular Dynamic simulations; however VAFs cannot be directly verified experimentally. By contrast, the co-ordination numbers (CNs) can be measured experimentally by X-ray and neutron scattering or computed by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and thus provide an alternative means of determining the location of the Frenkel line. In the present study, the CNs were computed by MC simulation using the Kihara potential, and the Frenkel anomalies were identified at {P = 100 bar, T = 260 K}, in good agreement with previous results based on VAFs, and at {P = 1000 bar, T = 370 K}, which deviates significantly from them.</description>

      <title>Entropy Engineering-Regulated Electron-Phonon Coupling for Highly Efficient Photoluminescence in Se-doped WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited quantum yield of strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides grown by vapor-phase methods and during transfer-based stacking poses a fundamental challenge for their optoelectronic applications. Here, we introduce the concept of "entropy engineering" as a transformative strategy to selectively enhance light-matter interactions through controlled electron-phonon coupling. We unveil how tailored entropy introduced via precise selenium doping or interfacial van der Waals proximity can significantly amplify radiative recombination from momentum-dark excitons in WS2 monolayers. Notably, we discover that slight selenium doping drastically enhances the photoluminescence (PL) of WS2 under strain. While both undoped and heavily doped WS2 suffer from strong PL quenching owing to the direct-to-indirect bandgap transition, lightly Se-doped samples exhibit an order-of-magnitude increase in emission intensity. This counterintuitive boost is traced to doping-induced structural disorder, which intensifies electron-phonon interactions and unlocks efficient phonon-assisted emission from otherwise non-radiative indirect excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate that van der Waals coupling to adjacent Se-doped layers can impart interfacial entropy and further augment PL via proximity effects. Our work highlights entropy engineering via controlled doping as a powerful strategy for activating high-efficiency light emission in atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxor ferroelectric thin films are recognized for their ultrahigh power density, rendering them highly promising for energy storage applications in electrical and electronic systems. However, achieving high energy storage performance with chemically homogeneous, environmentally friendly and compositionally stable materials remains challenging. In this work, we present a design of dielectrics with high energy storage performance via an in-plane polar domains incorporating polar nanoregions mechanism. Guided by phase-field simulations, we synthesized La/Si co-doping BaTiO3 solid-solution thin films with high chemical homogeneity to realize high energy storage performance. Given that, we achieve a high energy density of 203.7J/cm3 and an energy efficiency of approximately 80% at an electric field of 6.15MV/cm. This mechanism holds significant promise for the design of next-generation high-performance dielectric materials for energy storage and other advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cross-Domain Transfer for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in magnetic materials using the local spin density approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.</description>

      <title>Host-atom-driven transformation of a honeycomb oxide into a dodecagonal quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dodecagonal oxide quasicrystals (OQCs) have so far been limited to a few elemental systems, with no general formation mechanism established. Here, we demonstrate a versatile approach to OQC formation via a host-atom-induced transformation of a metal-oxide honeycomb (HC) network. Adsorption of Ba, Sr, or Eu onto the HC layer triggers its reorganization into a dodecagonal tiling, as revealed by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Full conversion occurs when 73% of the honeycomb rings are occupied. Kelvin probe and UV photoelectron spectroscopy show a linear decrease in work function with increasing host coverage, followed by a sharp increase upon quasicrystal formation due to reduced host dipoles. This transformation mechanism enables the fabrication of structurally precise OQCs, including a new Eu-Ti-O phase that extends the field to lanthanide quasicrystals, forming a 2D grid of localized magnetic moments. The method offers a general route to explore lattice-matched substrates for epitaxial growth and may be adapted to other 2D honeycomb materials - such as graphene, hexagonal ice, and silica - paving the way for engineered aperiodic systems beyond transition metal oxides.</description>

Abstract: We illustrate ion-beam engineering of MoO3 Ag Au multilayer plasmonic substrates to improve SERS performance, We illustrate ion-beam engineering of MoO3-Ag-Au multilayer plasmonic substrates to improve SERS performance. Orthorhombic {\alpha}-MoO3 microflakes were produced via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on Si-SiO2 substrates. Thin films of Ag (5 nm) and Au (5 nm) were thermally evaporated onto the MoO3 flakes, and the samples were subjected to 100 MeV Ag8+ swift heavy ion irradiation at fluences of 3e11 and 3e12 ions cm-2. Irradiation causes dewetting of metal films, prompting structural and morphological changes that result in the formation of dispersed Ag-Au nanoparticles, enhanced surface roughness, and defect generation within the MoO3 lattice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) verifies the {\alpha}-MoO3 phase; field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) elucidates nanoparticle formation and surface reorganisation; Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) disclose vibrational alterations and binding-energy shifts in Mo 3d, indicative of oxygen vacancies (V_O) and partial reduction of Mo. SERS measurements of molecular probes demonstrate significantly increased Raman intensities following ion irradiation.</description>

      <title>Effects of strain on the stability of the metallic rutile and insulating M1 phases of vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic density-functional theory study of the effects of strain on the structural and electronic properties in vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), with particular emphasis on its effect on the relative stability of the metallic rutile and the insulating monoclinic M1 phases. We consider various strain conditions that can be related to epitaxial strain present in VO$_2$ films grown on different lattice planes. Our calculations confirm the dominant role of $c$ axis strain, i.e., along the direction of the V-V dimerization in the M1 phase. Our analysis suggests that this effect stems primarily from the weakening of the lattice stiffness, with the hopping along the $c$ axis playing a minor role. We also confirm that, in strain scenarios that deform the basal plane, the $c$ axis strain still has a dominant effect on the phase stability.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio calculation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method in VASP: Self-consistent versus magnetic force theorem approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ab initio investigation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method implemented in the VASP code, with a comparative analysis of the self-consistent (SC) and magnetic force theorem (MFT) approaches. Using representative 3d ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) and Mn-based full Heusler compounds, we compute magnon dispersion relations directly from spin-spiral total energies and extract real-space Heisenberg exchange parameters via Fourier transformation. Curie temperatures are subsequently estimated within both the mean-field and random-phase approximations. The SC spin-spiral calculations yield exchange parameters and magnon spectra in excellent agreement with previous theoretical data, confirming their quantitative reliability across different classes of magnetic systems. In contrast, the MFT approach exhibits systematic quantitative deviations: it overestimates spin-spiral energies and exchange couplings in high-moment systems such as bcc Fe and the Mn-based Heuslers, while underestimating them in low-moment fcc Ni. The magnitude of these discrepancies increases strongly with magnetic moment size, exceeding several hundred percent in the high-moment compounds. These findings underscore the decisive role of self-consistency in accurately determining magnetic exchange parameters and provide practical guidance for future first-principles studies of spin interactions and excitations using the spin-spiral technique.</description>

      <title>Deterministic hBN bubbles as a versatile platform for studies on single-photon emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional materials are highly promising candidates for quantum technologies. SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and reproduce results. Here, we address this problem and propose a platform based on large-area metaloraganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN, which combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam irradiation, we achieve additional functionalities, including an interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200\%, dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects. Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low temperatures, our bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing studies as a function of temperature. To improve the control over the shape and position of bubbles, we demonstrate a~mask-based method that enables deterministic control over bubble formation. The presented hBN bubbles constitute a versatile platform for reproducible studies of hBN-based emitters, providing a reliable insight into their nature and properties.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced multiferroicity in Cr1/3NbS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, in which electric polarization and magnetic order coexist and couple, offer rich opportunities for both fundamental discovery and technology. However, multiferroicity remains rare due to conflicting electronic requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. One route to circumvent this challenge is to exploit the noncollinear ordering of spin cycloids, whose symmetry permits the emergence of polar order. In this work, we introduce another pathway to multiferroic order in which strain generates polarization in materials that host nonpolar spin spirals. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we chose the spin spiral in the well-studied helimagnet Cr1/3NbS2. To detect the induced polarization, we introduce the technique of magnetoelectric birefringence (MEB), an optical probe that enables spatially-resolved and unambiguous detection of polar order. By combining MEB imaging with strain engineering, we confirm the onset of a polar vector at the magnetic transition, establishing strained Cr1/3NbS2 as a type-II multiferroic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic frictional forces resisting droplet motion often appear to be separate to surface wettability and adhesive forces. Here we show that such friction arises from a simple combination of the contact angle hysteresis and adhesive force. We show theoretically, and confirm using tilt angle experiments of droplets on liquid-like surfaces, the dependence of the coefficient of droplet-on-solid kinetic friction on system parameters. We also show that a molecular kinetic-type model can describe the observed non-linear velocity-force relationship. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the relationship between droplet-on-solid friction, and wettability and liquid adhesion.</description>

      <title>Assessment of different loss functions for fitting equivalent circuit models to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.</description>

      <title>A physics-aware deep learning model for shear band formation around collapsing pores in shocked reactive materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts. These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation tools for reactive materials.</description>

      <title>Real-time dynamics with bead-Fourier path integrals. II. Bead-Fourier RPMD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman path integrals (PIs) have found many uses in approximate quantum dynamics methods that are able to efficiently calculate real-time quantum correlation functions. The PIs typically take the form of discrete imaginary time slices over a closed path, where the slices form the ``beads'' of a ring polymer (RP) necklace. Some methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), use the RP to generate an effective potential for the dynamics, while others, like RP molecular dynamics (RPMD), directly utilize the RP in real-time dynamics in order to incorporate quantum effects. The standard, discretized bead forms of CMD and RPMD can require a large number of RP beads to provide accurate results for systems where quantum effects are strong, such as at low temperatures. In Paper I, we introduced the bead-Fourier (BF) CMD method, where we utilized the inclusion of a Fourier sine series to reduce the number of beads needed to converge the CMD effective potential up to eightfold. In this work, we extend RPMD to incorporate BF-PIs in the form of BF-RPMD. We study a number of different implementations of the method through the calculation of correlation functions for both linear and non-linear operators. The effectiveness of the BF-RPMD method is sensitive to both the system and form of the operators being studied, but we show that this method is able to produce results on par with standard RPMD, with at worst twofold and up to eightfold reduction in the number of beads by including two to three Fourier components.</description>

      <title>Random State Approach to Quantum Computation of Electronic-Structure Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The effect of magnetic fields on vertex reconstructed muon-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of a Si pixel-based particle tracking scheme in muSR will, among others, allow measurements using a ten-fold increased stopped muons rate and samples ten times smaller than currently possible. Here we present simulation results to assess the effects of magnetic fields on two spectrometer configurations using a two-layered tracking scheme for the incoming and outgoing particles. At a low magnetic field of up to ~50 mT, the tracking and reconstruction accuracy is only minimally influenced. Beyond a magnetic field of ~80 mT the tracking capabilities diminish significantly. Operating a two-layered scheme using small magnetic fields hence does not require adaptations. Only at large magnetic fields, a tracking scheme that makes use of an accurate field map or the use of at least three layers must be employed to achieve reliable particle tracking.</description>

      <title>Material combination optimization for brazed ceramic-metal composites using Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven methodology for predicting a combination of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms are compared with the deep learning (DL) model. The developed models are tested using k-fold validation. Nine different input-output feature configurations are evaluated to assess the model performance. The input-output feature comprises material properties, namely, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and molecular mass of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials obtained from literature and the strength parameter (average Von Mises Stress (VMS)) estimated from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation for joint assembly structure. A multi-output model, Autoencoder (AE), has also been developed and tested to predict various features. The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data. The autoencoder model with a 32-16-32 structure outperforms LR, PR, RF, and ANN with an MSE of 0.04% for the prediction of unseen data. The developed multi-output model accurately predicts all the features (single and multiple), while PR fails to accurately predict multi-output features of low importance. The developed AE model predicts the different material properties with an average error of ~0.16-3.78% with literature-reported values.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the metal-insulator transitions in correlated vanadium dioxide through bandwidth and band-filling control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in correlated oxide systems opens up a new paradigm to trigger the abruption in multiple physical functionalities, enabling the possibility in unlocking exotic quantum states beyond conventional phase diagram. Nevertheless, the critical challenge for practical device implementation lies in achieving the precise control over the MIT behavior of correlated system across a broad temperature range, ensuring the operational adaptability in diverse environments. Herein, correlated vanadium dioxide (VO2) serves as a model system to demonstrate effective modulations on the MIT functionality through bandwidth and band-filling control. Leveraging the lattice mismatching between RuO2 buffer layer and TiO2 substrate, the in-plane tensile strain states in VO2 films can be continuously adjusted by simply altering the thickness of buffer layer, leading to a tunable MIT property over a wide range exceeding 20 K. Beyond that, proton evolution is unveiled to drive the structural transformation of VO2, with a pronounced strain dependence, which is accompanied by hydrogenation-triggered collective carrier delocalization through hydrogen-related band filling in t2g band. The present work establishes an enticing platform for tailoring the MIT properties in correlated electron systems, paving the way for the rational design in exotic electronic phases and physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy on the Kagome Magnet MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is the itinerant ferromagnet on the kagome lattice with high ordering temperature featuring complex electronic properties due to the nontrivial topological electronic band structure, where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays a crucial role. Here, we report a detailed ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopic study of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ aimed to elucidate and quantify the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy that is responsible for the alignment of the Mn magnetic moments in the kagome plane. By analyzing the frequency, magnetic field, and temperature dependences of the FMR modes, we have quantified the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density that reaches the value of approximately $ 3.5\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 3$ K and reduces to about $1\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 300$ K. The revealed significantly strong magnetic anisotropy suggests a sizable contribution of the orbital magnetic moment to the spin magnetic moment of Mn, supporting the scenario of the essential role of SOC for the nontrivial electronic properties of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</description>

      <title>Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</description>

      <title>On the discovery of meteoritic mineral Zolenskyite; The artificial origin should not be overlooked</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) {\AA}, b = 3.44(1) {\AA}, c = 5.94(1) {\AA} and \b{eta} = 117(1){\deg}. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubr\'eelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 {\AA}, b = 3.440 {\AA}, c = 11.441 {\AA} and \b{eta} = 90.55{\deg}, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubr\'eelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional flat-bands in Moire-diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of flat-bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has underscored the potential of moire engineering for correlated states, but such phases are notoriously difficult to realize and highly fragile against perturbations. Here, we propose an alternative route to flat-bands by introducing sp3 hybridization in twisted graphite. Instead of relying on fine-tuned magic angles, our approach identifies flat-band states at relatively large twist angles with short moire periods. In this regime, sp3-induced reconstructions generate electronic states that, once formed, are locked by substantial energy barriers, rendering them robust against external perturbations. Using twisted graphite as a prototype, we uncover a series moire-diamond that host two-dimensional flat conduction of valence bands, where carriers are localized within specific momentum planes but remain dispersive along orthogonal directions. The emergence of dimensional flat-bands opens a new platform for flat-band-driven correlated physics and suggests opportunities for designing quantum materials with highly directional electronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Local-Antisymmetric Flat Band and Coexisting Correlated stripe charge orders in WSe2-Modulated Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insulating, atomically flat transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like WSe2 are ideal substrates for probing intrinsic graphene properties. Conventionally, their influence on graphene's band structure is assumed negligible, particularly when small moire patterns form. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the atomic registry in graphene/WSe2 heterostructures profoundly modulates the electronic structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). At special graphene/WSe2 twist angles, an incommensurate moire superlattice hosts three distinct atomic stacking configurations (A, B, X types). These induce position-dependent potentials that asymmetrically shift MATBG's flat bands, transforming them from hole-side to electron-side asymmetric within a single AA-stacked region. This symmetry breaking enables the unprecedented coexistence of orthogonal stripe charge orders in the correlated regime-a phenomenon previously considered mutually exclusive due to Coulomb repulsion. This band modulation arises from the synergistic effects of the graphene/WSe2 interfacial atomic registry and heterostrain within the MATBG, exhibiting multi-field tunability. Our work establishes interfacial atomic registry as a critical, previously overlooked tuning parameter for flat-band physics, opening avenues to engineer correlated quantum states in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional excitations provide a key to identifying sought-after topological quantum spin liquid states in realistic materials. Their single-particle dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct, and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.</description>

      <title>A Large-Language-Model Assisted Automated Scale Bar Detection and Extraction Framework for Scanning Electron Microscopic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.</description>

      <title>Bright Single-Photon Emission from Individual Tin-Vacancy Centers in Multi-Cone Diamond Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamonds containing color centers have recently gathered significant attention for photonic quantum technologies, including quantum sensing, photonic quantum computers, and quantum networks. Among the various color centers, tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are particularly promising due to the high emission efficiency from the zero-phonon line and due to their long spin coherence times. However, the extraction of photons from diamond remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate high photon extraction from a single SnV center incorporated in a diamond nanopillar with tapered sidewalls and a multi-cone structure. A sharp emission peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $6\,$nm was observed at a wavelength of $619\,$nm. Furthermore, the second-order correlation function exhibited an antibunching dip well below $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.5$, indicating single-photon emission. Remarkably, the emitter achieved a high saturation count rate of approximately $9\,$Mcps. These results establish our nanopillar platform as a promising candidate for bright and stable quantum sources and sensors based on SnV centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Switching in Altermagnets via Asymmetric Sublattice Spin Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deterministic switching mechanism in collinear altermagnets driven by asymmetric sublattice spin currents. Unlike conventional antiferromagnets, where combined parity-time-reversal symmetry enforces purely staggered sublattice spin torques, altermagnets host symmetry-protected nonrelativistic spin splitting that produces unequal torques on the two sublattices. Using doped FeSb$_2$ as a representative $d$-wave altermagnet, our Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert simulations show that these torques enable magnetic-field-free and deterministic 180$^\circ$ N\'eel vector reversal over picosecond timescale. The mechanism is generic to even-parity altermagnets and remains effective even in centrosymmetric, weak spin-orbit coupled systems, where the N\'eel spin-orbit torque mechanism fails. Our results establish an experimentally accessible mechanism for switching of altermagnetic order, opening pathways for realizing ultrafast, low-power altermagnet spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unlocking High-Throughput Heterojunction Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a ubiquitous proxy for material quality in optoelectronic devices, widely used for high-throughput materials discovery. However, we demonstrate that in the presence of charge-selective contacts, PL loses its predictive reliability and can exhibit strong quenching even in highly efficient photovoltaic devices under open-circuit conditions. By combining steady-state and transient PL with contactless transient surface photovoltage measurements we disentangle the intertwined processes of extraction and recombination, clarifying the physical origin of this phenomenon. This joint approach reveals extraction dynamics not captured by PL alone. A digital replica of the interface shows that Coulomb attraction and interfacial recombination are the fundamental mechanisms driving quenching after charge extraction. Based on these insights, we present a decision tree for heterojunction classification and PL interpretation applicable across diverse optoelectronic systems, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LEDs. Our approach supports systematic screening and optimization of half-devices, bridging the gap between accelerated materials discovery and accelerated device discovery.</description>

      <title>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>The Capriccio method as a versatile tool for quantifying the fracture properties of glassy materials under complex loading conditions with chemical specificity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to provide insights into fracture mechanisms while maintaining chemical specificity. However, particle-based techniques such as MD are limited in terms of accessible length scales and applicable boundary conditions, which restricts the investigation of fracture phenomena in typical engineering settings. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we apply the partitioned-domain Capriccio method to couple atomistic MD samples representing silica glass with the finite element (FE) method. With this approach, we perform mode I (rectangular panel under tension, three-, and four-point bending), mode II as well as mode III (rectangular panel under in-plane or out-of-plane shear) simulations. Thereby, we investigate multiple criteria to identify the onset of crack propagation based on the virial stress, the number of pair interactions, the kinetic energy/temperature, the crack velocity, and the crack opening displacement. The approach presented provides quantitatively plausible results for the critical stress intensity factors KIc, KIIc, and KIIIc. This contribution shows that the Capriccio method is a flexible means of performing fracture simulations that take into account boundary conditions typical of experimental test setups with atomistic specificity near the crack tip. While also pointing out the current limitations of the Capriccio method, we demonstrate its potential to integrate atomistic insights into FE models with significantly larger overall dimensions.</description>

      <title>Realization of strain induced multiple topological phases in Cu$_2$SnS$_3$: An $ab$-$initio$ study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search of multiple topological phases (TPs) and their transitions by tuning different parameters through chemical substitutions, electric field, magnetic field, strain and Floquet engineering, etc has garnered a widespread attention in recent time. In spite of great effort, the observations of multiple TPs in a single material and multiple TP transitions in the presence of one parameter remain elusive. Here we demonstrate the presence of multiple TPs and their transitions with uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) in orthorhombic Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using $state$-$of$-$the$-$art$ $ab$-$initio$ calculations. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits a single (type-II) nodal-ring and in the presence of SOC, it hosts Weyl phase with seven Weyl points (three at $\Gamma$ and four at general positions) along with nodal arcs. On the application of UCS, it remains type-II nodal-ring $&lt;5.5$\%, which further evolves into type-III nodal-ring for $5.5\% \leq$ UCS $&lt;5.6$\%. Interestingly, at 5.6\% of UCS, it shows Weyl phase with four Weyl nodes even in the absence of SOC. All the above-mentioned seven Weyl points persist below $5$\% of UCS. For 5\% $\leq$ UCS $&lt;5.6$\%, four Weyl points (at general positions) disappear and nodal-arcs remain intact in all the studied range of UCS. The TPs observed in the absence of SOC appears to arise due to the presence of strain driven topological flat band, which is typically reported to be seen in kagome and Lieb lattices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Sn-Intercalated TaSe$_2$: Structural Diversity Obscured by Routine Characterization Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate the presence of structural heterogeneity captured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that eludes the routine characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electronic transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtained crystals diverse in stoichiometry and structure, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\lesssim{x}\lesssim1$. Using SCXRD, we found global structural diversity, identifying three new structure types: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{2.0}$/Sn$_{0.08}$TaSe$_{1.96}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.16}$TaSe$_{2.0}$ ($P6_3/mmc$), and Sn$_{1.2}$TaSe$_{1.9}$ ($Fmm2$). Using STEM, we observed local structural diversity, manifested as regions of highly variable stacking within a single crystal. In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction did not resolve all observed global structures. Raman spectroscopy was unable to distinguish between different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Electronic transport measurements showed consistent superconductivity and charge density wave behavior irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount. Our results indicate that routine approaches to characterization of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides may be inadequate for capturing the diversity of this family of materials, highlighting the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network approach to the point defect model for electrochemical oxide film growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the N\'eel temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how light modifies long-range order in quantum materials is key to improving our ability to control functionality. However, this is challenging if the response is heterogeneous. Here we address the most common form of light-induced heterogeneity, surface melting, and measure the dynamics of orbital order in the layered manganite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4. We isolate the surface dynamics from the bulk by measuring the orbital truncation rod as well as orbital Bragg peak. After photoexcitation, the orbital Bragg peak shows an unusual narrowing, which suggests an increase in the correlation length in the probed volume. In contrast, the correlation length at the surface decreases. These differences can be reconciled if the material is heterogeneous, and light melts a less ordered surface. By isolating the surface response, we determine that the loss of long-range order is an incoherent process, which is likely accompanied by the formation of local polarons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While scattered light conveys most of the information we perceive, scattering may also distort that information before it reaches our detectors. The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the \(C_{2}\) symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity (\(\beta\)). At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of \(\beta\) inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moir\'e Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</description>
