      <title>From HNSW to Information-Theoretic Binarization: Rethinking the Architecture of Scalable Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely predominantly on in-memory approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes over high-precision floating-point vectors, resulting in escalating operational cost and inherent trade-offs between latency, throughput, and retrieval accuracy. This paper analyzes the architectural limitations of the dominant "HNSW + float32 + cosine similarity" stack and evaluates existing cost-reduction strategies, including storage disaggregation and lossy vector quantization, which inevitably sacrifice either performance or accuracy. We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism. Unlike conventional ANN systems, this approach enables exhaustive search over compact binary representations, allowing deterministic retrieval and eliminating accuracy degradation under high query concurrency. Using the MAIR benchmark across 14 datasets and 10,038 queries, we compare this architecture against Elasticsearch, Pinecone, PGVector, and Qdrant. Results demonstrate retrieval quality comparable to full-precision systems, while achieving substantially lower latency and maintaining constant throughput at high request rates. We show that this architectural shift enables a truly serverless, cost-per-query deployment model, challenging the necessity of large in-memory ANN indexes for high-quality semantic search.</description>

      <title>Cost-Aware Logging: Measuring the Financial Impact of Excessive Log Retention in Small-Scale Cloud Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Log data plays a critical role in observability, debugging, and performance monitoring in modern cloud-native systems. In small and early-stage cloud deployments, however, log retention policies are frequently configured far beyond operational requirements, often defaulting to 90 days or more, without explicit consideration of their financial and performance implications. As a result, excessive log retention becomes a hidden and recurring cost.
  This study examines the financial and operational impact of log retention window selection from a cost-aware perspective. Using synthetic log datasets designed to reflect real-world variability in log volume and access patterns, we evaluate retention windows of 7, 14, 30, and 90 days. The analysis focuses on three metrics: storage cost, operationally useful log ratio, and cost per useful log. Operational usefulness is defined as log data accessed during simulated debugging and incident analysis tasks.
  The results show that reducing log retention from 90 days to 14 days can lower log storage costs by up to 78 percent while preserving more than 97 percent of operationally useful logs. Longer retention windows provide diminishing operational returns while disproportionately increasing storage cost and query overhead. These findings suggest that modest configuration changes can yield significant cost savings without compromising system reliability.
  Rather than proposing new logging mechanisms, this work offers a lightweight and accessible framework to help small engineering teams reason about log retention policies through a cost-effectiveness lens. The study aims to encourage more deliberate observability configurations, particularly in resource-constrained cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Scheduling for Optimal Spot Instance Savings in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling delay-sensitive jobs over spot and on-demand cloud instances to minimize average cost while meeting an average delay constraint. Jobs arrive as a general stochastic process, and incur different costs based on the instance type. This work provides the first analytical treatment of this problem using tools from queuing theory, stochastic processes, and optimization. We derive cost expressions for general policies, prove queue length one is optimal for low target delays, and characterize the optimal wait-time distribution. For high target delays, we identify a knapsack structure and design a scheduling policy that exploits it. An adaptive algorithm is proposed to fully utilize the allowed delay, and empirical results confirm its near-optimality.</description>

      <title>The Energy-Throughput Trade-off in Lossless-Compressed Source Code Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving data from large-scale source code archives is vital for AI training, neural-based software analysis, and information retrieval, to cite a few. This paper studies and experiments with the design of a compressed key-value store for the indexing of large-scale source code datasets, evaluating its trade-off among three primary computational resources: (compressed) space occupancy, time, and energy efficiency. Extensive experiments on a national high-performance computing infrastructure demonstrate that different compression configurations yield distinct trade-offs, with high compression ratios and order-of-magnitude gains in retrieval throughput and energy efficiency. We also study data parallelism and show that, while it significantly improves speed, scaling energy efficiency is more difficult, reflecting the known non-energy-proportionality of modern hardware and challenging the assumption of a direct time-energy correlation. This work streamlines automation in energy-aware configuration tuning and standardized green benchmarking deployable in CI/CD pipelines, thus empowering system architects with a spectrum of Pareto-optimal energy-compression-throughput trade-offs and actionable guidelines for building sustainable, efficient storage backends for massive open-source code archival.</description>

      <title>FlipFlop: A Static Analysis-based Energy Optimization Framework for GPU Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as Large Language Models, are primarily driven and executed by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These GPU programs (kernels) consume substantial amounts of energy, yet software developers often lack the hardware expertise and ad hoc knowledge required to optimize for power efficiency. We propose FlipFlop, a framework using static code analysis to predict energy consumption and recommend Pareto-optimal thread block configurations considering both power consumption and execution time. Our framework requires no runtime execution and analyzes PTX code, a low-level instruction set for CUDA-enabled GPUs. It is validated across a diverse set of GPUs and kernels, including multi-head attention, convolution, and matrix multiplication. FlipFlop achieves 83% accuracy in identifying locally optimal energy-efficient configurations, while also minimizing developer effort by reducing the optimization search space by 93.4%. For multi-head attention kernels, it yields up to 79% energy savings and 106% throughput gains relative to NVIDIA's occupancy heuristic. By integrating static analysis with real-time monitoring and providing explainable optimization guidance, FlipFlop empowers developers to create sustainable, high-performance GPU software which minimizes environmental and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Paradigms of End-to-End Data Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, where international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete, as it equates provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities across the entire edge-to-core spectrum. This paper investigates six common paradigms, ranging from network latency and TCP congestion control to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization that critically impact data movement workflows. These paradigms represent widely adopted engineering assumptions that inform system design, procurement decisions, and operational practices in production data movement environments. We introduce the "Drainage Basin Pattern" conceptual model for reasoning about end-to-end data flow constraints across heterogeneous hardware and software components to address the fidelity gap between raw bandwidth and application-level throughput. Our findings are validated through rigorous production-scale deployments, including U.S. DOE ESnet technical evaluations and transcontinental production trials over 100 Gbps operational links. The results demonstrate that principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design enables consistent, predictable performance for moving data at scale and speed.</description>

      <title>KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</description>

      <title>Mitigating GIL Bottlenecks in Edge AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying Python-based AI agents on resource-constrained edge devices presents a critical runtime optimization challenge: high thread counts are needed to mask I/O latency, yet Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) serializes execution. We demonstrate that naive thread pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": a performance degradation of &gt;= 20% at overprovisioned thread counts (N &gt;= 512) on edge representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system that uses a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) to distinguish genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (which is limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (which blocks during CPU bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free-threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices due to context switching overhead, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This work provides a practical optimization strategy for memory-constrained edge AI systems where traditional solutions fail.</description>
