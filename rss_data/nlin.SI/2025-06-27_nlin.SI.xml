      <title>On the geometry of a 4-dimensional extension of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry type $A_1^{(1)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric study of a four-dimensional integrable discrete dynamical system which extends the autonomous form of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry of type $A_1^{(1)}$. By resolution of singularities it is lifted to a pseudo-automorphism of a rational variety obtained from $({\mathbb P}^1)^{\times 4}$ by blowing up along 28 subvarieties and we use this to establish its integrability in terms of conserved quantities and degree growth. We embed this rational variety into a family which admits an action of the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})\times \widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})$ by pseudo-isomorphisms. We use this to construct two 4-dimensional analogues of $q$-Painlev\'e equations, one of which is a deautonomisation of the original autonomous integrable map.</description>

      <title>Borel-Pad\'e exponential asymptotics for the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger model with next-to-nearest neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we study discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger models combining nearest (NN) and next-nearest (NNN) neighbor interactions, motivated by experiments in waveguide arrays. While we consider the more experimentally accessible case of positive ratio $\mu$ of NNN to NN interactions, we focus on the intriguing case of competing such interactions $(\mu&lt;0)$, where stationary states can exist only for $-1/4 &lt; \mu &lt; 0$. We analyze the key eigenvalues for the stability of the pulse-like stationary (ground) states, and find that such modes depend exponentially on the coupling parameter $\eps$, with suitable polynomial prefactors and corrections that we analyze in detail. Very good agreement of the resulting predictions is found with systematic numerical computations of the associated eigenvalues. This analysis uses Borel-Pad\'{e} exponential asymptotics to determine Stokes multipliers in the solution; these multipliers cannot be obtained using standard matched asymptotic expansion approaches as they are hidden beyond all asymptotic orders, even near singular points. By using Borel-Pad\'{e} methods near the singularity, we construct a general asymptotic template for studying parametric problems which require the calculation of subdominant Stokes multipliers.</description>

      <title>Landau levels of a Dirac electron in graphene from non-uniform magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics is well known when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure of the 4-vertex model, and the higher-spin XXX chain, and Yang-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement the quantum inverse scattering method for the 4-vertex model. In comparison to previous works of the author which examined the 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, the 4-vertex model exhibits different characteristics, ranging from L-operators expressed in terms of projectors and Pauli matrices to algebraic and combinatorial properties, including Poisson structure and boxed plane partitions. With far fewer computations with an L-operator provided for the 4-vertex model by Bogoliubov in 2007, in comparison to those for L-operators of the 6, and 20, vertex models, from lower order expansions of the transfer matrix we derive a system of relations from the structure of operators that can be leveraged for studying characteristics of the higher-spin XXX chain in the weak finite volume limit. In comparison to quantum inverse scattering methods for the 6, and 20, vertex models which can be used to further study integrability, and exact solvability, an adaptation of such an approach for the 4-vertex model can be used to approximate, asymptotically in the weak finite volume limit, sixteen brackets which generate the Poisson structure. From explicit relations for operators of the 4-vertex transfer matrix, we conclude by discussing corresponding aspects of the Yang-Baxter algebra, which is closely related to the operators obtained from products of L-operators for approximating the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices. The structure of computations from L-operators of the 4-vertex model directly transfers to L-operators of the higher-spin XXX chain, revealing a similar structure of another Yang-Baxter algebra of interest.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for the passive scalar in decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the exact analytic solution for the one-point distribution of a passive scalar in decaying homogeneous turbulence, in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity at fixed Schmidt number. The velocity statistics are governed by the Euler ensemble, obtained previously as the spontaneously stochastic solution to the loop equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in the extreme turbulent limit. The resulting advection-diffusion problem is solved explicitly via loop calculus. For an initially localized scalar distribution, the solution develops a sequence of concentric spherical shells with a quantized, piecewise-parabolic radial profile of temperature with a finite limit at the center -- an outcome not predicted by conventional theories. This shell structure is a unique solution of the transport equation within the Euler ensemble, but may be smeared by finite diffusivity or forcing. It represents the geometric skeleton of scalar transport in ideal turbulence, and may be relevant in astrophysical or quantum-fluid regimes where dissipation is negligible. This work redefines expectations for scalar mixing in the high-Reynolds-number limit.</description>
