      <title>Predictive Performance of Deep Quantum Data Re-uploading Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning models incorporating data re-uploading circuits have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional expressivity and trainability. However, their ability to generate accurate predictions on unseen data, referred to as the predictive performance, remains insufficiently investigated. This study reveals a fundamental limitation in predictive performance when deep encoding layers are employed within the data re-uploading model. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that when processing high-dimensional data with limited-qubit data re-uploading models, their predictive performance progressively degenerates to near random-guessing levels as the number of encoding layers increases. In this context, the repeated data uploading cannot mitigate the performance degradation. These findings are validated through experiments on both synthetic linearly separable datasets and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that when processing high-dimensional data, the quantum data re-uploading models should be designed with wider circuit architectures rather than deeper and narrower ones.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Microwave Whispering Gallery Mode Spectroscopy of Paramagnetic Impurities in High-Purity Crystalline LiF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-noise cryogenic microwave spectroscopy experiment was performed on a high-purity lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal. The spectroscopy data revealed avoided level crossing interactions in whispering gallery modes, indicative of electron spin resonance (ESR) coupling with paramagnetic impurities. Analysis of the interaction spectra identified distinct spin systems corresponding to ${S = 3/2, I = 7/2}$, ${S = 1, I = 7/2}$, and ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$. The number of hyperfine splittings observed, together with the natural abundance of ions possessing the appropriate nuclear spin values, suggest that V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ impurities, exhibiting orthorhombic distortion, are the most likely sources of the narrow interaction features. This interpretation is supported by earlier ESR studies and established manufacturing records for LiF crystal growth. Additionally, a separate set of broader interaction points is consistent with an orthorhombic model involving a ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$ spin system, although the specific impurity responsible for this interaction remains unidentified.</description>

      <title>Time-averaged continuous quantum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of continuous quantum measurement allows to reconstruct the state $\rho_t$ of a system from a continuous stochastic measurement record $I_t$. However, this truly continuous-time signal $I_t$ is never available in practice. In experiments, one generally has access to its digitization, i.e., to a series of time averages $I_k$ over finite intervals of duration $\Delta t$. In this letter, we take this digitization seriously and define $\bar{\rho}_n$ as the best Bayesian estimate of the quantum state given (only) a digitized record $(I_1,\dots,I_n)$. We show that $\bar{\rho}_{n+1}$ can be computed recursively from $I_{n+1}$ and $\bar{\rho}_n$ using an exact formula. The latter can be evaluated numerically exactly, or used as the basis for a perturbative expansion into successive powers of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$. This allows reconstructing quantum trajectories in regimes of coarse $\Delta t$ where existing methods fail, estimating parameters at fixed $\Delta t$ without bias, and directly sampling digitized quantum trajectories with schemes of arbitrarily high order.</description>

      <title>Observation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a digital quantum computation of two-hadron scattering in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions. We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Trapped Ions and Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.</description>

      <title>Large Parts are Generically Entangled Across All Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic high-dimensional bipartite pure states are overwhelmingly likely to be highly entangled. Remarkably, this ubiquitous phenomenon can already arise in finite-dimensional systems. However, unlike the bipartite setting, the entanglement of generic multipartite pure states, and specifically their multipartite marginals, is far less understood. Here, we show that sufficiently large marginals of generic multipartite pure states, accounting for approximately half or more of the subsystems, are entangled across all bipartitions. These pure states are thus robust to losses in entanglement distribution and potentially useful for quantum information protocols where the flexibility in the collaboration among subsets of clients is desirable. We further show that these entangled marginals are not only shareable in closed systems, but must also induce entanglement in other marginals when some mild dimension constraints are satisfied, i.e., entanglement transitivity is a generic feature of various many-body closed systems. We further observe numerically that the genericity of (1) entangled marginals, (2) unique global compatibility, and (3) entanglement transitivity may also hold beyond the analytically established dimension constraints, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Detector noise in continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detector noise is a critical factor in determining the performance of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system. In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the trusted detector noise model is widely used to enhance both the secret key rate and transmission distance. This model assumes that noise from the coherent detector is inherently random and cannot be accessed or manipulated by an adversary. Its validity rests on two key assumptions: (1) the detector can be accurately calibrated by the legitimate user and remains isolated from the adversary, and (2) the detector noise is truly random. So far, extensive research has focused on detector calibration and countermeasures against detector side-channel attacks. However, there is no strong evidence supporting assumption (2). In this paper, we analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced Photoreceiver, which has been applied in CV-QKD implementations, and demonstrate that assumption (2) is unjustified. To address this issue, we propose a "calibrated detector noise" model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on assumption (1). Numerical simulations comparing different noise models indicate that the new model can achieve a secret key rate comparable to the trusted-noise model, without depending on the questionable assumption of "truly random" detector noise.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal performance of square-root measurement for general score functions and quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Barnum-Knill theorem states that the optimal success probability in the multiple state discrimination task is not more than the square root of the success probability when the pretty good or square-root measurement is used for this task. An assumption of the theorem is that the underlying ensemble consists of finitely many quantum states over a finite-dimensional quantum system. Motivated in part by the fact that the success probability is not a relevant metric for continuous ensembles, in this paper we provide a generalization of the notion of pretty good measurement and the Barnum-Knill theorem for general quantum ensembles, including those described by a continuous parameter space and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To achieve this, we also design a general metric of performance for quantum measurements that generalizes the success probability, namely, the expected gain of the measurement with respect to a positive score function. A notable consequence of the main result is that, in a Bayesian estimation task, the mean square error of the generalized pretty good measurement does not exceed twice the optimal mean square error.</description>

      <title>Generating Asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering between Two movable Mirrors Exploiting Correlated-Emission Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum steering is a form of quantum correlation that exhibits an inherent asymmetry, distinguishing it from entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It is now understood that quantum steering plays a pivotal role in asymmetric quantum information tasks. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate asymmetric steering between two mechanical modes by transferring quantum coherence from a correlated-emission laser. To accomplish this, we derive quantum Langevin equations to describe the optomechanical coupling between two cavity modes and two mechanical modes along with the master equation of two-mode laser. By examining the case where the cavity modes scatter at the anti-Stokes sidebands, we demonstrate that both two-way and one-way steering can be achieved by adjusting the strength of the field driving the gain medium of the laser. Furthermore, we show that the direction of one-way steering can be controlled by varying the temperatures of the mechanical baths or the strengths of the optomechanical couplings. Additionally, we reveal that the directionality of one-way steering depends on the modes fluctuation levels of the modes, with the mode exhibiting larger fluctuations determining the direction. This highly controllable scheme could potentially be realized with current technology, offering a promising platform for implementing one-way quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounding Hilbert Space Dimensions which can Realize all the Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel upper bounds on the Hilbert space dimensions required to realize quantum correlations in Bell scenarios. We start by considering bipartite cases wherein one of the two parties has two settings and two outcomes. Regardless of the number of measurements and outcomes of the other party, the Hilbert space dimension of the first party can be limited to two while still achieving all convexly extremal quantum correlations. We then leverage Schmidt decomposition to show that the remaining party can losslessly also be restricted to a qubit Hilbert space. We then extend this idea to multipartite scenarios. We also adapt our results to provide upper bounds of local Hilbert space dimensions to achieve any quantum correlation, including convexly non-extremal correlations, by utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Finally, we generalize our results to nonstandard Bell scenarios with communication. Taken together, our results fill in several previously unresolved aspects of the problem of determining sufficient Hilbert space dimensionality, expanding the collection of scenarios for which finite-dimensional quantum systems are known to be sufficient to reproduce any quantum correlation.</description>

      <title>A detailed study on ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition in the dissipative anisotropic Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodic-non-ergodic phase transition is one of the paramount features of the anisotropic Dicke model. Here, we have thoroughly examined the effect of the dissipation by analyzing both the eigenvalue and eigenvector properties of the Liouvillian with the aid of the scaling of Liouvilian gap, and the average participation ratio. We show that the properties of the eigenvectors of Liouvillian are consistent with those of the eigenvalues, revealing a phase diagram, which has similarities to the non-ergodic to ergodic transition in the closed undriven system. We also uncover that the Liouvillian gap is independent of system size in the non-ergodic phase whereas in the ergodic phase, it scales with the atom number as: $N^{-z}$ where $0&lt;z&lt;1$. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the driven case where a Thue-Morse quasi-periodic sequence is applied and observe that the boson dissipation plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the prethermal plateau. Our investigation indicates that a non-ergodic phase is more favorable than the ergodic phase in the presence of bosonic dissipation.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is, how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here we study by explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</description>

      <title>Inflationary power spectrum from the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Critical Spectrum and Quantum Criticality in the Two-Photon Rabi-Stark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties and quantum criticality of the two-photon Rabi-Stark model. Using the exact solution of this model, we rigorously derive a condition for complete spectral collapse, where all bound states vanish. In this case, the energy gap closes at a critical coupling, signaling a continuous quantum phase transition. The corresponding gap exponent differs from those in both the one-photon Rabi-Stark model and the quantum Rabi model, suggesting a distinct universality class. Furthermore, mapping to an inverse square potential well reveals an infinite number of discrete bound states at high two-level atomic frequencies, with their energies approaching the threshold exponentially. Our results offer new insights into novel spectral phenomena in nonlinear quantum Rabi models, with potential implications for experimental realizations in circuit QED and trapped ion systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal phase-insensitive force sensing with non-Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitivity to approach the limits set by fundamental physical laws. Even a single continuous mode offers enhanced precision, with the improvement scaling with its occupation number. Due to their high information capacity, continuous modes allow for the engineering of quantum non-Gaussian states, which not only improve metrological performance but can also be tailored to specific experimental platforms and conditions. Recent advancements in control over continuous platforms operating in the quantum regime have renewed interest in sensing weak forces, also coupling to massive macroscopic objects. In this work, we investigate a force-sensing scheme where a physical process completely randomizes the direction of the induced phase-space displacement, and the unknown force strength is inferred through excitation-number-resolving measurements. We find that $N$-spaced states, where only every $N^{\text{th}}$ Fock state occupation is nonzero, approach the achievable sensing bound. Additionally, non-Gaussian states are shown to be more resilient against decoherence than their Gaussian counterparts with the same occupation number. While Fock states typically offer the best protection against decoherence, we uncover a transition in the metrological landscape -- revealed through a tailored decoherence-aware Fisher-information-based reward functional -- where experimental constraints favor a family of number-squeezed Schr\"odinger cat states. Specifically, by implementing quantum optimal control in a minimal spin-boson system, we identify these states as maximizing force sensitivity under lossy dynamics and finite system controllability. Our results provide a pathway for enhancing force sensing in a variety of continuous quantum systems, ranging from massive systems like mechanical oscillators to massless systems such as quantum light and microwave resonators.</description>

      <title>Competition between heating and cooling effects in an optomechanical oscillator using a squeezed field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light is a useful phenomenon that can be exploited to improve the sensitivity of specific classes of detectors based on optomechanical effects. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential application of a squeezed field in the cooling of an optomechanical oscillator. It has been shown that this field could cool an oscillator below the standard limit of a coherent field. In this study, the effect of squeezed light was evaluated by explicitly examining the role of the squeezing parameters on the final effective temperature of the oscillator. The results show that the observed cooling and heating effects are strongly dependent on the squeezing parameters and the phase. Using an oscillator of 2$\pi\times$10.1 MHz driven by a 1064-nm laser, the lowest effective temperature and quantum number are three orders of magnitude smaller compared to the case of no squeezing; especially, these minimum values are obtained at the squeezing phase of about 0.8$\pi$. This study highlighted important insights for the optimization of cooling efficiency using squeezed light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The satellite mission EAGLE-1 represents an important step towards a future pan-European secure quantum key distribution (QKD) network. The public-private partnership behind the mission consists of a consortium of universities, research institutes, and companies partially funded by ESA, the European Union, and supported by national delegations. This unique combination of academic partners and industry facilitates a swift knowledge transfer from basic research to commercial application. Within the consortium, Tesat-Spacecom (TESAT) is responsible for developing and integrating the payload assembly of the low-earth orbit EAGLE-1 satellite. In addition, TESAT provides the SCOT80 laser terminal with minor adaptations for the mission. Here, we report on the status, technical aspects and TESATs contribution to the satellite-to-ground prepare-and-measure QKD mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an optimal quantum control strategy for the deterministic preparation of entangled harmonic oscillator states in trapped ions. The protocol employs dynamical phase modulation of laser-driven Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings interactions. We prepare Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum (TMSV) states in the mechanical motions of a trapped ion and characterize the states with phase-space tomography. First, we verify continuous-variable entanglement by measuring an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement parameter of 0.0132(7), which is below the threshold of 0.25 for Reid's EPR criterion. Second, we perform a continuous-variable Bell test and find a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, measuring 2.26(3), which is above the entanglement threshold of 2. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our method by preparing a non-Gaussian entangled oscillator state--a superposition of TMSV states.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Diffusion Models for Parameterized Quantum Circuit Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential, yet its practical success depends on multiple factors, including advances in quantum circuit design. In this paper, we introduce a generative approach based on denoising diffusion models (DMs) to synthesize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Extending the recent diffusion model pipeline of F\"urrutter et al. [1], our model effectively conditions the synthesis process, enabling the simultaneous generation of circuit architectures and their continuous gate parameters. We demonstrate our approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods. This work illustrates the potential of generative models as a powerful tool for accelerating and optimizing the design of PQCs, supporting the development of more practical and scalable quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Controlling Excitation Localization in Waveguide QED Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate excitation dynamics in one-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters coupled to a waveguide, focusing on localization and long-time population trapping. By combining time-domain simulations with spectral analysis of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we identify two distinct mechanisms that give rise to localization: geometry-induced subradiance and disorder-induced Anderson-like confinement. Spatially modulated emitter arrangements--such as single- and double-Gaussian transverse profiles--enable long-lived subradiant modes even in the absence of disorder, with decay rates that can be finely controlled via geometric parameters. In contrast, localization in uniform arrays emerges only when disorder breaks spatial symmetry and suppresses collective emission through interference. We track the crossover between geometric and disorder-induced regimes, finding that double-Gaussian profiles exhibit clear spatial signatures of this transition, while single-Gaussian configurations display more gradual changes. These results establish geometry and disorder as complementary tools for engineering long-lived quantum states in waveguide QED systems, with direct relevance for scalable implementations in photonic platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary metaplectic representations of the group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ are necessary to describe the evolution of $2^n$-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. We construct the general matrix form of such representations, together with appropriately defined magnetic translations based on the diagonal subgroup of the tensor product of the finite Heisenberg group $HW_{2^n} \otimes HW_{2^n}$. It is shown that in order for the metaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n$-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary.</description>

      <title>Time-nonlocal versus time-local long-time extrapolation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high numerical demands for simulating non-Markovian open quantum systems motivate a line of research where short-time dynamical maps are extrapolated to predict long-time behavior. The transfer tensor method (TTM) has emerged as a powerful and versatile paradigm for such scenarios. It relies on a systematic construction of a converging sequence of time-nonlocal corrections to a time-constant local dynamical map. Here, we show that the same objective can be achieved with time-local extrapolation based on the observation that time-dependent time-local dynamical maps become stationary. Surprisingly, the maps become stationary long before the open quantum system reaches its steady state. Comparing both approaches numerically on examples of the canonical spin-boson model with sub-ohmic, ohmic, and super-ohmic spectral density, respectively, we find that, while both approaches eventually converge with increasing length of short-time propagation, our simple time-local extrapolation invariably converges at least as fast as time-nonlocal extrapolation. These results suggest that, perhaps counter-intuitively, time-nonlocality is not in fact a prerequiste for accurate and efficient long-time extrapolation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nullifiers of non-Gaussian cluster states through homodyne measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplexing potential of large-scale optical Gaussian cluster states was already experimentally demonstrated. Non-Gaussian states must be embedded in a cluster state to reach universality and fault tolerance. Basic quantum operations with the potential to induce non-Gaussianity, such as photon subtraction, start to broaden the available experimental toolbox as well. The interplay of the two, non-Gaussian multimode cluster states, remains challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we propose a framework for characterization of non-Gaussian cluster states. In analogy to nowadays frequently used Gaussian nullifiers, we define non-Gaussian nullifiers of cluster states that enable certification of non-Gaussianity in the cluster state. We illustrate the concept on an example of cluster state created from photon subtracted squeezed states. The nullifier can be evaluated from homodyne measurement, which is a natural detection for optical cluster states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New convenient thumbrules are obtained to test entanglement of wavefunctions for bipartite qubit and qutrit systems. All results are analytic. The new results are: (a) For bipartite qubit systems there exists a matrix $A$ for which $\det A = 0$ implies unentanglement while $\det A \ne 0$ implies entanglement. There is an underlying SU(2) algebra. (2) Teleportation for a general qubit state is possible by using non-maximally entangled bipartite qubit states. This protocol has an additional parameter, viz., $\det A$, which enhances the cryptographic security of the teleportation. (c) For qutrits there is a matrix $P$ for which $\det P = 0$ simultaneously with ${\rm tr}P=\pm 1$ imply unentanglement. Any departure from these conditions implies entanglement. There exists an underlying SU(3) algebra. (d) Physical interpretation of the underlying algebras are given and plausible experimental scenarios are proposed for the SU(2) case in the context of two entangled electrons. (e) The entanglement entropy in both cases, viz., for qubits and qutrits respectively, are expressed in terms of the determinants and trace of the matrices mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Zak Phase and Higher Winding Numbers in an Electroacoustic Cavity System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.</description>

      <title>Realizing Bloch Dynamics in a Low-Cost Electrically Driven Acoustic Two-Level System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike classical bits that can only occupy one of two discrete states, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in arbitrary coherent superpositions of the ground and excited states. This fundamental distinction grants qubits enhanced capabilities for information storage and processing. The Bloch sphere provides an intuitive and powerful geometric framework for visualizing, characterizing, and controlling the dynamical evolution of a qubit under external driving fields. By mapping the state evolution onto the Bloch sphere, processes such as spin flips and phase accumulation can be vividly represented as trajectories, enabling direct insight into coherent control mechanisms. Here, we implement Bloch dynamics in a classical platform by constructing a tunable acoustic two-level system based on high-quality-factor electro-acoustic coupled cavities. Using programmable spatiotemporal external field modulation, we demonstrate full Bloch sphere control through classical analogs of quantum phenomena, including Rabi oscillations, Floquet dynamics, Ramsey interference, and spin echo sequences. Our results bridge coherent Bloch dynamics with classical wave control, revealing a versatile experimental platform for exploring quantum-inspired physics. Furthermore, the system exhibits exceptional capabilities for precision transient acoustic field shaping, enabled by high-fidelity pulse-driven modulation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchic superradiant phases in anisotropic Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points (EPs). We find that the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum AIXI: Universal Intelligence via Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical analogues of AIXI which are theoretically consistent or practically feasible as models of universal intelligence. To address this question, we extend the framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally affects QAIXI models.</description>

      <title>Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit, interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line, ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical Cramer-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for quantum-enhanced DM detection.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian with Energy Levels Corresponding to Riemann Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenvalues $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n-$th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimal Control Using MAGICARP: Combining Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and Gradient Ascent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the MAGICARP algorithm, a numerical optimization method for quantum optimal control problems that combines the structure provided by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and the robustness of gradient ascent techniques, such as GRAPE. MAGICARP is formulated as a "shooting technique", aiming to determine the appropriate initial adjoint momentum to realize a target quantum gate. This method naturally incorporates time and energy optimal constraints through a PMP-informed pulse structure. We demonstrate MAGICARP's effectiveness through illustrative numerical examples, comparing its performance to GRAPE and highlighting its advantages in specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fisher information from quantum many-particle arrival time measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum arrival time measurement process for a Bosonic many-particle system, with the aim of extracting statistical information on single-particle properties. The arrival time is based on a dynamical multi-particle absorption model in the Fock space, and we consider systems in coherent and incoherent mixtures of $N$-particle states. We find the resulting probability distributions for arrival time sequences, which we consider as parametric models for the statistical inference of single-particle parameters, and derive a tractable expression for the associated (classical) Fisher information. Subsequently focusing on the concrete case of the momentum parameter of a 1D particle, we consider the idealized limits of a point (Dirac delta) detector and an infinite particle system forming a spatially uniform ``beam''. We observe that even though no information remains in the spatial distribution, the single-particle momentum is indeed identifiable from the arrival time data, even in the limit of ``sparse beams'' of vanishing particle density, where we obtain simple analytical form for the Fisher information, which, interestingly, coincides with the one obtained from a hypothetical time-stationary detection model. Our results contribute to the fundamental understanding of temporal measurement data arising from quantum systems consisting of freely evolving particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three quantum algorithms for solving a multi-dimensional drift-diffusion equation. They rely on a quantum linear system solver, a quantum random walk, and the quantum Fourier transform. We compare the complexities of these methods to their classical counterparts, finding that diagonalisation via the quantum Fourier transform offers a quantum computational advantage for solving linear partial differential equations at a fixed final time. We employ a multidimensional amplitude estimation process to extract the full probability distribution from the quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Strong Molecule-Light Entanglement with Molecular Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a molecular optomechanical platform to generate robust entanglement among bosonic modes-photons, phonons, and plasmons-under ambient conditions. The system integrates an ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical resonator with a plasmonic nanocavity formed by a metallic nanoparticle and a single molecule. This hybrid architecture offers two critical advantages over standalone plasmonic systems: (i) Efficient redirection of Stokes photons from the lossy plasmonic mode into the long-lived WGM resonator, and (ii) Suppression of molecular absorption and approaching vibrational ground states via plasmon-WGM interactions. These features enable entanglement to transfer from the fragile plasmon-phonon subsystem to a photon-phonon bipartition in the blue-detuned regime, yielding robust stationary entanglement resilient to environmental noise. Remarkably, the achieved entanglement surpasses the theoretical bound for conventional two-mode squeezing in certain parameter regimes. Our scheme establishes a universal approach to safeguard entanglement in open quantum systems and opens avenues for noise-resilient quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Meson Scattering in a Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering processes are fundamental for understanding the structure of matter. At the same time, simulating the real-time dynamics of scattering processes on classical computers is challenging. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue for efficiently simulating such phenomena. In this work, we investigate meson scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with staggered fermions. We construct mesonic wave packets using a quantum subspace expansion (QSE) approach to obtain high-fidelity meson creation operators. Using these, we propose an efficient quantum circuit decomposition for meson wave packet preparation using Givens rotations. Our approach significantly reduces the circuit depth compared to previous methods. Simulating the time evolution of wave packets classically with Tensor Networks, we observed both elastic and inelastic scattering and provide a detailed analysis of energy transfer, entanglement entropy, and particle production. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of simulating inelastic meson scattering on near-term quantum devices and provide insights into meson dynamics in confining gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present definitive violations of non-contextual hidden variable bounds in the latest generation of IBM noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ). These violations are based on known tests for contextuality such as the Rio Negro inequality and pseudo-telepathic Mermin games. These are the first violations of the classical Mermin game on IBM NISQ computers, and the largest such violations for the Rio Negro inequality. The use of finite geometries proves instrumental in the development of more effective tests, with larger geometries providing sizeable datasets from which multiple distinct experiments can be compared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum Markov chain algorithm for many-body systems that utilizes a special phase of matter known as the Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase. We show how the properties of the MBL phase enable one to address the conditions for ergodicity and sampling from distributions of quantum states. We demonstrate how to exploit the thermalized-to-localized transition to tune the acceptance rate of the Markov chain, and apply the algorithm to solve a range of combinatorial optimization problems of quadratic order and higher. The algorithm can be implemented on any quantum hardware capable of simulating the Floquet dynamics of a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, providing a practical way of extending the range of simulable Hamiltonians of current QPUs.</description>

      <title>Test and characterization of multilayer ion traps on fused silica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion traps are a promising architecture to host a future quantum computer. Several challenges, such as signal-routing, power dissipation, and fabrication quality need to be overcome to scale ion trap devices to hundreds of ions. Currently, ion traps are often fabricated on silicon substrates which result in high power dissipation. Substrates that lead to lower power dissipation are preferred. In this work, we present a multi-metal layer ion trap on a fused silica substrate that is fabricated and tested in an industrial facility. Its design and material-stack are tailored to minimize power dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the integrated temperature sensors and verify functionality down to 10 K. Moreover, we demonstrate an automated wafer test to validate each trap chip prior to its integration into experimental setups. Subsequently, we characterize electric field noise and electric stray fields using a single trapped-ion as a probe, showing an improvement in trap performance over similar trap designs realized on silicon substrates.</description>

      <title>Reduced Density Matrices and Phase-Space Distributions in Thermofield Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is a powerful framework to account for thermal effects in a wavefunction setting, and has been extensively used in physics and quantum optics. TFD relies on a duplicated state space and creates a correlated two-mode thermal state via a Bogoliubov transformation acting on the vacuum state. However, a very useful variant of TFD uses the vacuum state as initial condition and transfers the Bogoliubov transformation into the propagator. This variant, referred to here as the inverse Bogoliubov transformation (iBT) variant, has recently been applied to vibronic coupling problems and coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians in a chemistry context, where the method is combined with efficient tensor network methods for high-dimensional quantum propagation. In the iBT/TFD representation, the mode expectation values are clearly defined and easy to calculate, but the thermalized reduced particle distributions such as the reduced 1-particle densities or Wigner distributions are highly non-trivial due to the Bogoliubov back-transformation of the original thermal TFD wavefunction. Here we derive formal expressions for the reduced 1-particle density matrix (1-RDM) that uses the correlations between the real and tilde modes encoded in the associated reduced 2-particle density matrix (2-RDM). We apply this formalism to define the 1-RDM and the Wigner distributions in the special case of a thermal harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we discuss several approximate schemes that can be extended to higher-dimensional distributions. These methods are demonstrated for the thermal reduced 1-particle density of an anharmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dissipation has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to quantum coherence, it is increasingly recognized as a powerful computational resource. Dissipative protocols can prepare complex many-body quantum states by leveraging engineered system-environment interactions. This essay focuses on a class of algorithms that utilize algorithmically constructed Lindblad generators, and highlight recent advances enabling the preparation of ground and thermal states for certain non-commuting Hamiltonians with rigorous performance guarantees. We also propose extensions of these protocols to prepare excited and resonance states, which may offer new pathways toward realizing practical quantum advantage on early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Magnon blockade in spin-magnon systems with frequency detuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon blockade is a physical mechanism for the preparation of a single-magnon source, which has important applications in quantum information processing. Here we propose a scheme for generating an optimal magnon blockade in the spin-magnon quantum system. By introducing frequency detuning between the magnon and the spin qubit of the NV center, the conventional magnon blockade and the unconventional magnon blockade can be obtained under both strong and weak coupling, relaxing the requirements for coupling strength. Moreover, the conventional and unconventional magnon blockade can occur simultaneously when both the magnon and the spin qubit are driven. This allows the equal-time second-order correlation function to reach $10^{-8}$, about five orders of magnitude lower than that in previous works. Additionally, the time-delayed second-order correlation function avoids oscillation. Our study demonstrates the impact of frequency detuning on the magnon blockade and proposes methods to enhance the magnon blockade and relax the requirements for coupling strength through frequency detuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalies are deeply connected to the renowned Atiyah-Singer (AS) index theorem. While often associated with fermionic systems, anomalies can also emerge in purely bosonic settings. In this paper, we explore a particularly simple example of such a case: the quantum harmonic oscillator. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physiacl sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime. This correspondence reveals the internal energy of oscillator as a concrete manifestation of the index theorem. Moreover, we show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality ellipse and application in single-photon imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to quantify the interplay between coherence and wave-particle duality in generic two-path interference systems. Our analysis reveals a closed-form duality ellipse (DE) equality, that rigorously unifies visibility (a traditional waveness measure) and predictability (a particleness measure) with degree of coherence, providing a complete mathematical embodiment of Bohr's complementarity principle. Extending this framework to quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP), where both path information and photon interference are inherently linked to spatial object reconstruction, we establish an imaging duality ellipse (IDE) that directly connects wave-particle duality to the object's transmittance profile. This relation enables object characterization through duality measurements alone and remains robust against experimental imperfections such as decoherence and misalignment. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of quantum duality while offering a practical toolkit for optimizing coherence-driven quantum technologies, from imaging to sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime offer a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, particularly owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated, and high-fidelity interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of 27~$\mathrm{\mu}$K and read out in a single-shot with 77% fidelity. During the membrane's 6~ms lifetime, the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the membrane's position noise-spectrum, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at 10~mK and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Microtubules for Scalable Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers in the Microtubule (MT) lattice. In the cavity-MT model proposed by the authors, according to which the MT interiors are modeled as high-Q quantum-electrodynamics cavities, decoherence-resistant entangled states have been argued to emerge under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ s. The latter is the result of strong electric-dipole interactions of tubulin dimers with ordered-water dipole quanta in the MT interior. We re-interpret the classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models, describing the emergent dynamics of solitonic excitations in such systems, as representing quantum coherent (or possibly pointer) states, arising from the incomplete collapse of quantum-coherent dipole states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer across the MT networks. We underpin logic-gate-like behavior through MT-associated proteins and detail how these structures may support scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage being a quDit associated with the basic unit of the MT honeycomb lattice. We describe in detail the decision-making process, after the action of an external stimulus, during which optimal path selection for energy-loss-free signal and information transport across the MT network emerges. Finally, we propose experimental pathways, including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes, to experimentally validate our predictions for MT-based, scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing SPION Labeling for Single-Cell Magnetic Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the correlation between iron mass on cell surfaces and the resultant magnetic field. Human colorectal cancer cells (HT29 line) were labeled with varying concentrations of SPIONs and imaged via a NV center widefield magnetic microscope. To assess the labeling efficacy, a convolutional neural network trained on simulated magnetic dipole data was utilized to reconstruct key labeling parameters on a cell-by-cell basis, including cell diameter, sensor proximity, and the iron mass associated with surface-bound SPIONs.
  Our analysis provided quantitative metrics for these parameters across a range of labeling concentrations. The findings indicated that increasing SPION concentration enhances both the cell-surface iron mass and magnetic field strength, demonstrating a saturation effect. This methodology offers a coherent framework for the quantitative, high-throughput characterization of magnetically labeled cells, presenting significant implications for the fields of cell biology and magnetic sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum hard rod model, a one-dimensional extension of the Lieb-Liniger model, is exactly solved using an adapted Bethe ansatz. Our solution, benchmarked against path-integral quantum Monte Carlo calculations, reveals significant corrections to the excitation spectrum and thermodynamic properties, previously overlooked by the standard excluded-volume approach. We also show that the hard rod model exhibits Luttinger liquid behavior across a wide range of parameters, at zero and finite temperature, as unveiled by correlation functions. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding strongly correlated regimes in dilute 1D systems, with applications to quantum wires, spin chains, and ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans\"{a}tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors have demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.</description>

      <title>From Chern to Winding: Topological Invariant Correspondence in the Reduced Haldane Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of the topological properties and edge states of the Haldane model defined on a honeycomb lattice with zigzag edges. By exploiting translational symmetry along the ribbon direction, we perform a dimensional reduction that maps the two-dimensional model into a family of effective one-dimensional systems parametrized by the crystal momentum $k_x$. Each resulting one-dimensional Hamiltonian corresponds to an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with momentum-dependent hoppings and onsite potentials. We introduce a natural rotated basis in which the Hamiltonian becomes planar and the winding number ($\nu$) is directly computable, providing a clear topological characterization of the reduced model. This framework enables us to derive closed-form expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations across the full Brillouin zone. We show that the $\nu$ exactly reproduces the Chern number of the parent model in the topologically nontrivial phase and allows for an exact characterization of the edge modes. Analytical expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations are derived without requiring perturbative methods. Our analysis further reveals the critical momentum $ k_c $ where edge states traverse the bulk energy gap, and establishes precise conditions for the topological phase transition. In contrast to earlier models, such as plaquette-based tight-binding reductions, our method reveals hidden geometric symmetries in the extended SSH structure that are essential for understanding the topological behavior of systems with long-range hopping. Our findings offer new insight into the topological features of zigzag nanoribbons and establish a robust framework for analyzing analogous systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Doubling and Entanglement in Coherent Many-Body Chemical Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quantum degenerate regime, atoms and molecules can occupy a single quantum state, forming coherent matter waves. Here reactions are described by nonlinear mixing of the matter waves, giving rise to quantum many-body chemistry, where spatial coherence is preserved between the reactants and products. While the phase matching of matter waves during the reaction process has been theoretically predicted, experimental confirmation has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of matter wave phase doubling when bosonic atoms pair into molecules. Using matter wave diffraction, we verify spatial phase coherence and observe a two-fold increase of phase in the molecular wavefunction, confirming the matter-wave version of phase doubling. The diffraction patterns also reveal non-classical correlations indicative of entangled atom pairs formed during the reaction. Our results establish molecular matter-wave diffraction as a powerful tool to probe quantum coherence and entanglement generation in chemically reactive quantum gases.</description>

Abstract: Polariton chemistry has been hailed as a potential new route to direct molecular processes with electromagnetic fields. To make further strides, it is essential for the community to clarify which unusual polaritonic phenomena are true hallmarks of cavity quantum electrodynamics and which can be rationalized with classical optical physics. Here, we provide a tutorial perspective on the formation, spectroscopy, and behavior of polaritons using classical optics. Where possible, we draw connections to cavity-enhanced spectroscopy and recast open questions in terms that may be more familiar to the broader community of physical chemists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of negative eigenvalue(s) in the spectrum of the partially transposed density matrix confirms the entanglement of the quantum state. The negative eigenvalue(s) also quantify the amount of entanglement through novel entanglement measures, $e.g.$, negativity. In this paper, we have presented a complete characterization of the spectrum of the partially transposed density matrix for the pure bipartite quantum state acting on a generic ${\cal H}_s (dim~2) \otimes {\cal{H}}_l (dim~2l+1)$ Hilbert space ($e.g.$, spin - orbital angular momentum space). We found that the spectrum contains only one negative eigenvalue. Its magnitude, and hence the negativity of the quantum correlation, equals the square root of the determinant of the reduced density matrix (traced over the $l$-space). We have also shown that entanglement entropy, negativity, concurrence of the density matrix, purity of the reduced density matrix, all scale with the single variable, determinant of the reduced density matrix. Finally, we computed the negativity for the spin-orbit correlations of partons in polarized and unpolarized hadrons.</description>

      <title>Cryptography from Lossy Reductions: Towards OWFs from ETH, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-way functions (OWFs) form the foundation of modern cryptography, yet their unconditional existence remains a major open question. In this work, we study this question by exploring its relation to lossy reductions, i.e., reductions~$R$ for which it holds that $I(X;R(X)) \ll n$ for all distributions~$X$ over inputs of size $n$. Our main result is that either OWFs exist or any lossy reduction for any promise problem~$\Pi$ runs in time~$2^{\Omega(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$, where $\tau_\Pi(n)$ is the infimum of the runtime of all (worst-case) solvers of~$\Pi$ on instances of size~$n$. In fact, our result requires a milder condition, that $R$ is lossy for sparse uniform distributions (which we call mild-lossiness). It also extends to $f$-reductions as long as $f$ is a non-constant permutation-invariant Boolean function, which includes And-, Or-, Maj-, Parity-, Modulo $k$, and Threshold $k$-reductions.
  Additionally, we show that worst-case to average-case Karp reductions and randomized encodings are special cases of mildly-lossy reductions and improve the runtime above as $2^{\Omega(\log \tau_\Pi)}$ when these mappings are considered. Restricting to weak fine-grained OWFs, this runtime can be further improved as~$\Omega(\tau_\Pi)$. Taking~$\Pi$ as~$kSAT$, our results provide sufficient conditions under which (fine-grained) OWFs exist assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Conversely, if (fine-grained) OWFs do not exist, we obtain impossibilities on instance compressions (Harnik and Naor, FOCS 2006) and instance randomizations of~$kSAT$ under the ETH.
  Finally, we partially extend these findings to the quantum setting; the existence of a pure quantum mildly-lossy reduction for $\Pi$ within the runtime~$2^{o(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$ implies the existence of one-way state generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement and quantum information lie at the root of quantum theory. These remarkable resources are generally believed to diminish when systems carrying them interact with their environment. By contrast, we find that engaging a system with its environment can increases its ability to carry quantum information. The maximum rate of transmission is given by the quantum channel capacity. We counter-intuitively boost this capacity of a channel by allowing it to leak almost all quantum information to the channel's environment. We conceptually and numerically explain this boost to arise from two-letter level super-additivity in the channel's coherent information. Such super-additivity has a far larger magnitude and a qualitatively wider extent than previously known. Our findings have a surprising implication for quantum key distribution: maximum rates for key distribution can be boosted by allowing leakage of information to the eavesdropping environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02581v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem states that a non-contextual hidden-variable theory cannot completely reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. Asher Peres gave a remarkably simple proof of quantum contextuality in a four-dimensional Hilbert space of two spin-1/2 particles. Peres's argument is enormously simpler than that of Kochen and Specker. Peres contextuality demonstrates a logical contradiction between quantum mechanics and the noncontextual hidden variable models by showing an inconsistency when assigning noncontextual definite values to a certain set of quantum observables. In this work, we present a similar proof in time with a temporal version of the Peres-like argument. In analogy with the two-particle version of Peres's argument in the context of spin measurements at two different locations, we examine here single-particle spin measurements at two different times $t=t_1$ and $t=t_2$. We adopt three classical assumptions for time-separated measurements, which are demonstrated to conflict with quantum mechanical predictions. Consequently, we provide a non-probabilistic proof of certified quantumness in time, without relying on inequalities, demonstrating that our approach can certify the quantumness of a device through single-shot, time-separated measurements. Our results can be experimentally verified with the present quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir computing in finite dimensions</title>

Abstract: Most existing results in the analysis of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) systems with classical inputs have been obtained using the density matrix formalism. This paper shows that alternative representations can provide better insights when dealing with design and assessment questions. More explicitly, system isomorphisms are established that unify the density matrix approach to QRC with the representation in the space of observables using Bloch vectors associated with Gell-Mann bases. It is shown that these vector representations yield state-affine systems (SAS) previously introduced in the classical reservoir computing literature and for which numerous theoretical results have been established. This connection is used to show that various statements in relation to the fading memory (FMP) and the echo state (ESP) properties are independent of the representation, and also to shed some light on fundamental questions in QRC theory in finite dimensions. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition for the ESP and FMP to hold is formulated using standard hypotheses, and contractive quantum channels that have exclusively trivial semi-infinite solutions are characterized in terms of the existence of input-independent fixed points.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for Enhancing Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Quantumness, Efficiency and Cost of Quantum Random Number Generators via Photon Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14085v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents two significant contributions from the perspectives of quantum random number generator (QRNG) manufacturers and users. For manufacturers, the conventional method of assessing the quantumness of single-photon-based QRNGs through mean and variance comparisons of photon counts is statistically unreliable due to finite sample sizes. Given the sub-Poissonian statistics of single photons, confirming the underlying distribution is crucial for validating a QRNG's quantumness. We propose a more efficient two-fold statistical approach to ensure the quantumness of optical sources with the desired confidence level. Additionally, we demonstrate that the output of QRNGs from exponential and uniform distributions exhibit similarity under device noise, deriving corresponding photon statistics and conditions for $\epsilon$-randomness.
  From the user's perspective, the fundamental parameters of a QRNG are quantumness, efficiency (random entropy and random number generation rate), and cost. Our analysis reveals that these parameters depend on three factors, namely, expected photon count per unit time, external reference cycle duration, and detection efficiency. A lower expected photon count enhances entropy but increases cost and decreases the generation rate. A shorter external reference cycle boosts entropy but must exceed a minimum threshold to minimize timing errors, with minor impacts on cost and rate. Lower detection efficiency enhances entropy and lowers cost but reduces the generation rate. Finally, to validate our results, we perform statistical tests like NIST, Dieharder, AIS-31, ENT etc. over the data simulated with different values of the above parameters. Our findings can empower manufacturers to customize QRNGs to meet user needs effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian subject to stochastic perturbations in its anti-Hermitian part, describing fluctuating gains and losses. The dynamics averaged over the noise is described by an `anti-dephasing' master equation. We characterize the resulting state evolution and analyze its purity. The properties of such dynamics are illustrated in a stochastic dissipative qubit. Our analytical results show that adding noise allows for a rich control of the dynamics, stabilizing the lossy state and making state purification possible to a greater variety of steady states.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Violation of no-signaling on a public quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No-signaling is a consequence of the no-communication theorem that states that bipartite systems cannot transfer information
  unless a communication channel exists. It is also a by-product of the assumptions of Bell theorem about quantum nonlocality. We have tested no-signaling in bipartite systems of qubits from IBM Quantum devices in extremely large statistics, resulting in significant violations. Although the time and space scales of IBM Quantum cannot in principle rule out subluminal communications, there is no obvious physical mechanism leading to signaling. The violation is also at similar level as observed in Bell tests. It is therefore mandatory to check possible technical imperfections that may cause the violation and to repeat the loophole-free Bell test at much larger statistics, in order to be ruled out definitively at strict spacelike conditions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing with qudits, an extension of qubits to multiple levels, is a research field less mature than qubit-based quantum computing. However, qudits can offer some advantages over qubits, by representing information with fewer separated components. In this article, we present QuForge, a Python-based library designed to simulate quantum circuits with qudits. This library provides the necessary quantum gates for implementing quantum algorithms, tailored to any chosen qudit dimension. Built on top of differentiable frameworks, QuForge supports execution on accelerating devices such as GPUs and TPUs, significantly speeding up simulations. It also supports sparse operations, leading to a reduction in memory consumption compared to other libraries. Additionally, by constructing quantum circuits as differentiable graphs, QuForge facilitates the implementation of quantum machine learning algorithms, enhancing the capabilities and flexibility of quantum computing research.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical self-organization in a mesoscopic atom array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the number of particles in a system often leads to qualitative changes in its properties, such as breaking of symmetries and the appearance of phase transitions. This renders a macroscopic system fundamentally different from its individual microscopic constituents. Lying between these extremes, mesoscopic systems exhibit microscopic fluctuations that influence behavior on longer length scales, leading to critical phenomena and dynamics. Therefore, tracing the properties of well-controlled mesoscopic systems can help bridge the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body systems. Here, we explore mesoscopic signatures of an optomechanical self-organization phase transition using arrays of cold atoms inside an optical cavity. By precisely engineering atom-cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behavior depends on atom number, identify characteristic dynamical behaviors in the self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. These findings advance our understanding of particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography, a fundamental tool for quantum physics, usually requires a number of state copies that scale exponentially with the system size, owing to the intricate quantum correlations between subsystems. We show that, in bosonic systems, the nature of correlations indeed fully determines this scaling. Motivated by the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and Boson-sampling, we define Gaussian-entanglable (GE) states, produced by generalized interference between separable bosonic modes. GE states greatly extend the Gaussian family, encompassing arbitrary separable states, multi-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes, entangled cat states, and Boson-sampling outputs -- resources for error correction and quantum advantage. Nonetheless, we prove that an m-mode pure GE state is learnable with only poly(m) copies, by providing an explicit protocol involving only heterodyne detection and classical post-processing. For states outside GE, we introduce an operational monotone -- the minimum number of ancillary modes required to render them GE -- and prove that it exactly captures the exponential overhead in tomography. As a by-product, we show that deterministic generation of NOON states with N&gt;=3 photons by two-mode interference is impossible.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Lean classical-quantum hybrid neural network model for image classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of algorithms from quantum information with neural networks has enabled unprecedented advancements in various domains. Nonetheless, the application of quantum machine learning algorithms for image classification predominantly relies on traditional architectures such as variational quantum circuits. The performance of these models is closely tied to the scale of their parameters, with the substantial demand for parameters potentially leading to limitations in computational resources and a significant increase in computation time. In this paper, we introduce a Lean Classical-Quantum Hybrid Neural Network (LCQHNN), which achieves efficient classification performance with only four layers of variational circuits, thereby substantially reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that LCQHNN achieves 100\%, 99.02\%, and 85.55\% classification accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Under the same parameter conditions, the convergence speed of this method is also faster than that of traditional models. Furthermore, through visualization studies, it is found that the model effectively captures key data features during training and establishes a clear association between these features and their corresponding categories. This study confirms that the employment of quantum algorithms enhances the model's ability to handle complex classification problems.</description>

      <title>Rotational stability in nanorotor and spin contrast in one-loop interferometry in the Stern-Gerlach setup</title>

Abstract: The rotation of a nanoparticle in a quantum system has many applications, from theory to experiments. This paper will treat nanoparticle rotational dynamics for spin-embedded nanorotors. We will model it as a rigid body that properly treats the rotation in the co-frame of the nanorotor in the presence of external fields. Besides rotation, we will further investigate how to create large spatial superpositions in the inhomogeneous external magnetic field, such as in the case of the Stern-Gerlach apparatus. The spin-embedded nanorotors play a crucial role in creating matter-wave interferometers through their spin and external magnetic field interaction Hamiltonian. We aim to provide a holistic interpretation of the dynamics of three Euler angles, their quantum evolution, and the nanorotor's spatial motion in a Stern-Gerlach-type setup where we will consider one-full-loop interferometry. We will then study how the quantum evolution of all the Euler angles leads to a spin coherence loss upon interference and what manifests the Einstein-de Haas effect in an external magnetic field. In particular, we show that by imparting rotation along the direction of the magnetic field, we can stabilise the nanorotor's libration mode. We will also extend our analysis to a case where the initial state of the libration mode is thermal and discuss the contrast loss due to interference of the nanorotor upon one-loop completion.</description>

      <title>Robust phase estimation of the ground-state energy without controlled time evolution on a quantum device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians in quantum systems is an important task. In this work, we demonstrate that the ground-state energy can be accurately estimated without controlled time evolution by using adiabatic state preparation (ASP) and Ramsey-type measurement. By considering the symmetry of the Hamiltonian governing the time evolution during ASP, we can prepare a superposition of the ground state and reference state whose eigenvalue is known. This enables the estimation of the ground-state energy via Ramsey-type measurement. Furthermore, our method is robust against non-adiabatic transitions, making it suitable for use with early fault-tolerant quantum computers and quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Reinforcement Learning with a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) under model-free settings with quantum oracle access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal quantum measurements for estimating different unknown parameters in a parameterized quantum state are usually incompatible with each other. Traditional approaches to addressing the measurement incompatibility issue, such as the Holevo Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound, suffer from multiple difficulties towards practical applicability, as the optimal measurement strategies are usually state-dependent, difficult to implement and also take complex analyses to determine. Here we study randomized measurements as a new approach for multi-parameter quantum metrology. We show quantum measurements on single copies of quantum states given by $3$-design perform near-optimally when estimating an arbitrary number of parameters in pure states and more generally, approximately low-rank states, whose metrological information is largely concentrated in a low-dimensional subspace. The near-optimality is also shown in estimating the maximal number of parameters for three types of mixed states that are well-conditioned on its support. Examples of fidelity estimation and Hamiltonian estimation are explicitly provided to demonstrate the power and limitation of randomized measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. Exact solutions and numerical results of selected examples are presented. For the $j = 3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase exhibits finite-temperature topological phase transitions characterized by abrupt jumps. The IGP for the same state similarly shows discontinuous jumps as the temperature varies. In the case of the $j = 1$ one-axis SSS, both Uhlmann phase and IGP display discrete finite-temperature jumps. By contrast, the $j = 1$ two-axis SSS shows no such transitions because the Uhlmann phase and IGP both vary smoothly with temperature. We also briefly discuss potential realizations and simulations related to these phenomena in spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical machine learning often struggles with complex, high-dimensional data. Quantum machine learning offers a potential solution, promising more efficient processing. The quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), a hybrid algorithm, fits current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. However, its training depends largely on classical computation. Future gate-based quantum computers may realize full quantum advantages. In contrast to QCNNs, quantum autoencoders (QAEs) leverage classical optimization solely for parameter tuning. Data compression and reconstruction are handled entirely within quantum circuits, enabling purely quantum-based feature extraction. This study introduces a novel image-classification approach using QAEs, achieving classification without requiring additional qubits compared with conventional QAE implementations. The quantum circuit structure significantly impacts classification accuracy. Unlike hybrid methods such as QCNN, QAE-based classification emphasizes quantum computation. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in a four-class classification task, evaluating various quantum-gate configurations to understand the impact of different parameterized quantum circuit structures on classification performance. Specifically, noise-free conditions are considered, and simulations are performed using a statevector simulator to model the quantum system with full amplitude precision. Our results reveal that specific ansatz structures achieve superior accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of conventional machine-learning methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters requiring optimization. These findings indicate that QAEs can serve as efficient classification models with fewer parameters and highlight the potential of utilizing quantum circuits for complete end-to-end learning.</description>

      <title>Scalable twin-field quantum key distribution network enabled by adaptable architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key application in quantum communication, enabling secure key exchange between parties using quantum states. Twin-field (TF) QKD offers a promising solution that surpasses the repeaterless limits, and its measurement-device-independent nature makes it suitable for star-type network architectures. In this work, we propose a scalable TF-QKD network with adaptable architecture, where users prepare quantum signals and send them to network nodes. These nodes use an optical switch to route the signals to multi-user measurement units, enabling secure key distribution among arbitrary users and adapting to complex connection demands of the network. A proof-of-principle demonstration with three users successfully achieved secure key sharing over simulated link losses of up to $30$ dB, with an average rate of $19.57$ bit/s. Additionally, simulations show that the proposed architecture can achieve a total secure key rate of $4.84 \times 10^{4}$ bit/s at $100$ km in a symmetric $32$-user network. This approach represents a significant advancement in the topology of untrusted-node QKD networks and holds promise for practical, large-scale applications in secure communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Zernike polynomials as a novel degree of freedom for encoding quantum information in the spatial structure of photons. Building on their orthogonality and completeness over the unit disc, we develop a framework for generating, manipulating, and detecting photons in Zernike modes, and propose methods for realizing single-photon and two-photon Zernike wave packets. We demonstrate analytically that two-photon states generated via spontaneous parametric down- conversion exhibit mode entanglement in the Zernike basis, with correlations arising from selection rules enforced by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Our results open a new pathway for structured spatial entanglement, complementary to schemes based on Laguerre-Gaussian or Hermite-Gaussian modes, and suggest practical experimental implementations based on holographic modulation and optical Fourier techniques.</description>

      <title>Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and these MPDO RFPs form a distinct class from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.</description>

Abstract: We design the information-acquiring von Neumann architecture of a computer in a fine-grained or coarse-grained model, where information is carried by classical bits. This architecture enables both a Hamiltonian process converting a given input pure state to another output pure state of the system to be considered (functionality) and a physical process to acquire information (subjectivity). The latter process is identified with the projection hypothesis in projective quantum measurement in the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Can Require Exponential Time to Optimize Linear Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QAOA is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve optimization problems in gate-based quantum computers. It is based on a variational quantum circuit that can be interpreted as a discretization of the annealing process that quantum annealers follow to find a minimum energy state of a given Hamiltonian. This ensures that QAOA must find an optimal solution for any given optimization problem when the number of layers, $p$, used in the variational quantum circuit tends to infinity. In practice, the number of layers is usually bounded by a small number. This is a must in current quantum computers of the NISQ era, due to the depth limit of the circuits they can run to avoid problems with decoherence and noise. In this paper, we show mathematical evidence that QAOA requires exponential time to solve linear functions when the number of layers is less than the number of different coefficients of the linear function $n$. We conjecture that QAOA needs exponential time to find the global optimum of linear functions for any constant value of $p$, and that the runtime is linear only if $p \geq n$. We conclude that we need new quantum algorithms to reach quantum supremacy in quantum optimization.</description>

An alternative modeling, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously ocuurs in quantum systems, is explored. The Fermi-Hubbard mode is employed to demonstrate a disentanglement-induced quantum phase transition into a state having a finite superconducting order parameter. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on Josephson junction's current phase relation is explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Ternary Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (TDIQKD) protocol based on the two-party Impossible Colouring pseudo-telepathy game, using maximally entangled qutrit states to enable secure key generation between distant parties. The protocol makes use of non-contextuality from the Kochen-Specker theorem, providing a quantum advantage in a task that is classically unachievable, and eliminates reliance on assumptions about the internal workings of quantum devices. A specially designed qutrit quantum circuit is employed for state preparation, and security is rigorously analyzed through a composable framework using smooth minimum entropy, von Neumann entropy, and Shannon entropy. The protocol achieves optimal key rate in the ideal case and maintains security under significant noise, with a finite-key analysis supporting practical deployment. The protocol is secure within an adequate security framework and demonstrates a higher key generation rate compared to standard QKD protocols, emphasizing the potential of high-dimensional quantum systems for secure communication.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of quantum acceleration in addressing infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enhance average reward outcomes. We introduce an innovative quantum framework for the agent's engagement with an unknown MDP, extending the conventional interaction paradigm. Our approach involves the design of an optimism-driven tabular Reinforcement Learning algorithm that harnesses quantum signals acquired by the agent through efficient quantum mean estimation techniques. Through thorough theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the quantum advantage in mean estimation leads to exponential advancements in regret guarantees for infinite horizon Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, the proposed Quantum algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, a significant improvement over the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ bound exhibited by classical counterparts.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of accelerated atoms using the theory of open quantum systems. We consider two atoms travelling along different hyperbolic trajectories with different proper times. We use the generalized master equation to discuss the dynamics of a pair of dipoles interacting with the electromagnetic field. The fundamental role played by proper acceleration in the entanglement harvesting and sudden death phenomenon is discussed. Finally, we discuss how the polarization of the atoms affects our results. For some choices of the polarization's configuration, we no longer observe the entanglement harvesting phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise limited magnetic field sensitivity of $5.9 \mathrm{nT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \mathrm{\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \mathrm{mW}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>

      <title>Cluster state as a non-invertible symmetry protected topological phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Shift photocurrent vortices from topological polarization textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. However, these structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. We propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions between topologically trivial bands occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are antiparallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for their experimental detection.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a versatile color center used for magnetometry, quantum computing, and quantum communications. In this article, using a single laser beam as a pump and probe, we measure the spin states of the NV center using the Faraday effect and use such measurements to develop a novel magnetic field sensor. Using the spin-state-dependent effect on the left and right circularly polarized light, we probe and confirm the existence of spin-orbit coupling in the NV center at room temperature. The sensitivity of our magnetometer is $350~$nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$, limited by the background produced by the laser trapped inside the diamond. We argue that by using an optical cavity and a high-purity diamond, sensitivities in the femtotesla level can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Preparation and observation of anomalous counterpropagating edge states in a periodically driven optical Raman lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of real-space edge modes with ultracold atoms [Braun et al., Nat. Phys. 20, 1306 (2024)], we investigate the preparation and detection of anomalous counterpropagating edge states -- a defining feature of the anomalous Floquet valley-Hall (AFVH) phase -- in a two-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice. Modeling the atomic cloud with a Gaussian wave packet state, we explore, both analytically and numerically, how the population of edge modes depends on the initial-state parameters. In particular, we reveal that, in addition to the internal spin state, the initial momenta parallel and perpendicular to the boundary play essential roles: they independently control the selective population of edge states across distinct momenta and within separate quasienergy gaps. Furthermore, we examine the wave-packet dynamics of counterpropagating edge states and demonstrate that their characteristic motion is robust against long-range disorder. These results establish a theoretical framework for future experimental explorations of the AFVH phase and topological phenomena associated with its unique edge modes.</description>

      <title>Theory of the photonic Joule effect in superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

Abstract: Ultracold atomic systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically verify and analytically prove a winding number invariant that correctly predicts the number of edge states in one-dimensional, nearest-neighbor (between unit cells), two-band models with any complex couplings and open boundaries. Our winding number uses analytical continuation of the wave-vector into the complex plane and involves two special points on the full Riemann surface band structure that correspond to bulk eigenvector degeneracies. Our winding number is invariant under unitary or similarity transforms. We emphasize that the topological criteria we propose here differ from what is traditionally defined as a topological or trivial phase in symmetry-protected classification studies. It is a broader invariant for our model that supports nonzero energy edge states and its transition does not coincide with the gap closing condition. When the relevant symmetries are applied, our invariant reduces to well-known Hermitian and non-Hermitian symmetry-protected topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Long-lived multilevel coherences and spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. The availability of numerous rotational states has inspired many proposed applications, including simulations of quantum magnetism, encodings of information in high-dimensional qudits, and synthetic dimensions with many synthetic lattice sites. Many of these applications are yet to be realised, primarily because engineering long-lived coherent superpositions of multiple rotational states is highly challenging. Here, we investigate how multilevel coherences between rotational states can be engineered by using optical tweezer traps operating close to a magic wavelength for a given pair of states. By performing precision Ramsey spectroscopy we find the exact magic wavelengths and sensitivities to detuning errors for multiple rotational state superpositions. We find that, for a trap polarised parallel to the quantisation axis, the magic wavelengths are closely clustered enabling long-lived coherence across multiple rotational states simultaneously. As an example, we demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. With modest experimental improvements, we predict that second-scale coherent dynamics of ten rotational states should be readily achievable.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model Induced by On-Site or Long-Range Two-Body Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the dissipative dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model induced by on-site or long-range two-body losses. We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shockwaves are violent nonlinear distortions of wave motion which have been reported in fluid waves and electromagnetic waves, while here we reveal that a shockwave can occur even in the quantum wave function of a single particle. Specifically, we analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle, and reveal that a strong longitudinal field can rip up a quantum shockwave singularity in the particle wave function, leading to energy dissipation. Moreover, we show that this effect is particularly strong for quasi-relativistic (Dirac) electrons in graphene for two reasons. On one hand, we obtain the single-particle shockwave at very small fields due to the small effective electron mass, and on the other hand we can obtain large dissipation in the many-particle shockwave by using the large electron density in graphene. While the single-particle shockwave can be most easily observed by locating the shockwave singularity with a high-resolution microscopy, the many-particle dissipation would be simply observed as a rapid decay of our resonant electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Observing structural disorder induced interacting topological phase in an atom array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <title>Momentum space entanglement of four fermion field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Momentum space entanglement of four fermion field theory is calculated from the Wilsonian effective action pertubatively using replica trick, local terms in low energy effective action are proved to be non-relevant pertubatively and nonlocal terms are the only source of entanglement between different momentum modes. The final result again can be represented by a set of basketball feynmann diagrams with new feynmann rules proposed to inteprete them.</description>
