      <title>Observation of nuclear modification of energy-energy correlators inside jets in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlators are constructed by averaging the number of charged particle pairs within jets, weighted by the product of their transverse momenta, as a function of the angular separation of the particles within a pair. They are sensitive to a multitude of perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics phenomena in high-energy particle collisions. Using lead-lead data recorded with the CMS detector, energy-energy correlators inside high transverse momentum jets are measured in heavy ion collisions for the first time. The data are obtained at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.70 nb$^{-1}$. A similar analysis is done for proton-proton collisions at the same center-of-mass energy to establish a reference. The ratio of lead-lead to proton-proton energy-energy correlators reveals significant jet substructure modifications in the quark-gluon plasma. The results are compared to different models that incorporate either color coherence or medium response effects, where the two effects predict similar substructure modifications.</description>

      <title>Nuclear recoil detection with color centers in bulk lithium fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present initial results on nuclear recoil detection based on the fluorescence of color centers created by nuclear recoils in lithium fluoride. We use gamma rays, fast and thermal neutrons, and study the difference in responses they induce, showing that this type of detector is rather insensitive to gamma rays. We use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to image nuclear recoil tracks from fast and thermal neutron interactions deep inside a cubic-centimeter sized crystal and demonstrate automated feature extraction in three dimensions using machine learning tools. The number, size, and topology of the events agree with expectations based on simulations with TRIM. These results constitute the first step towards 10-1000g scale detectors with single-event sensitivity for applications such as the detection of dark matter particles, reactor neutrinos, and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Most stringent bound on electron neutrino mass obtained with a scalable low temperature microcalorimeter array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19920v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale remains a fundamental open question in particle physics, with profound implications for both the Standard Model and cosmology. Direct kinematic measurements, independent of model-dependent assumptions, provide the most robust approach to address this challenge. In this Letter, we present the most stringent upper bound on the effective electron neutrino mass ever obtained with a calorimetric measurement of the electron capture decay of $^{163}$Ho. The HOLMES experiment employs an array of ion-implanted transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters, achieving an average energy resolution of 6 eV FWHM with a scalable, multiplexed readout technique. With a total of $7\times10^7$ decay events recorded over two months and a Bayesian statistical analysis, we derive an upper limit of $m_{\beta}&lt;27$ eV/c$^2$ at 90% credibility. These results validate the feasibility of $^{163}$Ho calorimetry for next-generation neutrino mass experiments and demonstrate the potential of a scalable TES-based microcalorimetric technique to push the sensitivity of direct neutrino mass measurements beyond the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\beta$-particles to determine cross sections relevant to the weak r-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron-rich isotopes with 30 $\leq$ Z $\leq$ 45 are thought to be synthesised in neutrino-driven winds after the collapse of a massive star. This nucleosynthesis scenario, called the weak r-process, is studied using nuclear reaction network calculations. The accuracy of the nucleosynthesis simulations is strongly influenced by the reliability of the nuclear physics input parameters used. Recently, it has been demonstrated that ($\alpha$,n) reactions play a particularly important role in the weak r-process, but their rates -- computed from the cross sections -- are only known with large uncertainties in the astrophysically relevant temperature range. The half-lives of the products of some key reactions are such that, in principle, the cross sections can be studied using the activation technique. In many cases, however, the $\beta$-decay of the reaction products leads to the ground state of the daughter nucleus, hence no gamma emission occurs. The purpose of this manuscript is to present our setup with which we determine the cross sections by measuring the yield of $\beta$-particles emitted during radioactive decay. The $^{86}$Kr($\alpha$,n)$^{89}$Sr reaction cross-section measurement is used, as a case study.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\nu$-dependence of projected energy correlators in HICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently derived factorization formula for energy-energy correlators to study the analytic structure of general $\nu$-point projected energy correlators in heavy ion collisions. The $\nu$-point projected energy correlators (or, $\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the integer $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations between $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\chi$) between the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the DGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\sim 1/\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We show that, in a thermal medium, the $\nu$-correlators display non-trivial angular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find that for non-integer values, particularly $\nu&lt;1$, medium-induced jet function is enhanced compared to $\nu&gt;1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios of $\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which encode an intrinsic angular information for $\nu&lt;1$ when compared to large $\nu$ values. Moreover, for small-$\nu$ values, the $\nu$-correlators appear to saturate at $\nu=0.01$. We further confirm our leading-order numerical computations against simulated events from JEWEL for the parton level production cross-section. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the effect of BFKL resummation for various values of $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Development and full realization of a high-resolution and high-sensitivity collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent implementation of a radio-frequency quadrupole cooler-buncher and a multi-step laser ionization technique, our previous developed collinear laser spectroscopy has been successful upgraded to a fully functional collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy system. The new system was fully characterized using a bunched ion beam at 30 keV energy, where hyperfine structure spectra of $^{85,87}$Rb isotopes were measured. An overall efficiency exceeding 1:200 was achieved while maintaining a spectral resolution of 100 MHz. Under these conditions, the extracted hyperfine structure parameters and isotope shift for $^{85,87}$Rb show excellent agreement with the literature values. These results demonstrate the system's capability to perform high-resolution and high-sensitivity laser spectroscopy measurements of neutron-rich Rb isotopes, which are expected to be produced at the Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility at a rate of approximately 100 particles per second.</description>

      <title>Highly charged isomeric qubits from antiproton annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged synthetic qubits in an ion-trap setup. We identify the qubit transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.</description>
