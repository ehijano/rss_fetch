      <title>Shift-generated $\alpha$-homogeneous classes of jointly measurable random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of shift-generated alpha-homogeneous random fields (RFs) C[Z] defined through a functional identity involving a fixed positive alpha and a given jointly measurable R^d-valued RF Z(t),t in R^l. The significance of such classes lies in the fact that their elements generate max-stable and stationary RFs. We extend the original functional identity to a broad class of functionals, including the integral operator S(.) and prove that C[Z] contains at least one L^alpha-continuous element. Finally, we investigate properties of local RFs and their connections with spectral tail and tail RFs.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Estimation through Kirchhoff Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a non-oriented edge-weighted graph, we show how to make some estimation of the associated Laplacian eigenvalues through Monte Carlo evaluation of spectral quantities computed along Kirchhoff random rooted spanning forest trajectories. The sampling cost of this estimation is only linear in the node number, up to a logarithmic factor. By associating a double cover of such a graph with any symmetric real matrix, we can then perform spectral estimation in the same way for the latter.</description>

      <title>Weak convergence of predictive distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X_n)$ be a sequence of random variables with values in a standard Borel space $S$. We investigate the condition \begin{gather}\label{x56w1q} E\bigl\{f(X_{n+1})\mid X_1,\ldots,X_n\bigr\}\,\quad\text{converges in probability,}\tag{*} \\\text{as }n\rightarrow\infty,\text{ for each bounded Borel function }f:S\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.\notag \end{gather} Some consequences of \eqref{x56w1q} are highlighted and various sufficient conditions for it are obtained. In particular, \eqref{x56w1q} is characterized in terms of stable convergence. Since \eqref{x56w1q} holds whenever $(X_n)$ is conditionally identically distributed, three weak versions of the latter condition are investigated as well. For each of such versions, our main goal is proving (or disproving) that \eqref{x56w1q} holds. Several counterexamples are given.</description>

      <title>On a $T_1$ Transport inequality for the adapted Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L^1$ transport-entropy inequality (or $T_1$ inequality), which bounds the $1$-Wasserstein distance in terms of the relative entropy, is known to characterize Gaussian concentration. To extend the $T_1$ inequality to laws of discrete-time processes while preserving their temporal structure, we investigate the adapted $T_1$ inequality which relates the $1$-adapted Wasserstein distance to the relative entropy. Building on the Bolley--Villani inequality, we establish the adapted $T_1$ inequality under the same moment assumption as the classical $T_1$ inequality.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the KMP model to the KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) process converges to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, as time $t$ goes to infinity, in a properly scaled observation window shifted by $t^{3/4}$. Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense.</description>

      <title>Neural Field Equations and Hawkes processes: long-term stability of traveling wave profiles in the neutral case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of a population of interacting Hawkes processes on the real line, with spatial extension. The large population behavior of the system is governed by the standard Voltage-based Neural Field Equation (NFE). We prove long-time stability of the system w.r.t. traveling wave solutions for the NFE on a diffusive time scale, in the neutral case, that is when the speed of the traveling wave solution is zero: the position of the traveling wave profile becomes essentially Brownian on a diffusive time scale. We borrow here from the seminal work of Chevallier, Duarte, L\''ocherbach and Ost concerning the approximation of NFE by Hawkes processes, the existence result of traveling waves of Ermentrout and McLeod and from the stability result of the traveling wave profile from Lang and Stannat. We provide also similar results concerning the activity based NFE.</description>

      <title>Finding a dense submatrix of a random matrix. Sharp bounds for online algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a dense submatrix of a matrix with i.i.d. Gaussian entries, where density is measured by average value. This problem arose from practical applications in biology and social sciences \cites{madeira-survey,shabalin2009finding} and is known to exhibit a computation-to-optimization gap between the optimal value and best values achievable by existing polynomial time algorithms. In this paper we consider the class of online algorithms, which includes the best known algorithm for this problem, and derive a tight approximation factor ${4\over 3\sqrt{2}}$ for this class. The result is established using a simple implementation of recently developed Branching-Overlap-Gap-Property \cite{huang2025tight}. We further extend our results to $(\mathbb R^n)^{\otimes p}$ tensors with i.i.d. Gaussian entries, for which the approximation factor is proven to be ${2\sqrt{p}/(1+p)}$.</description>

      <title>Decay of connection probability in high-dimensional continuum percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a percolation model on $\mathbb R^d$ called the random connection model. For $d$ large, we use the lace expansion to prove that the critical two-point connection probability decays like $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ as $|x| \to \infty$, with possible anisotropic decay. Our proof also applies to nearest-neighbour Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb Z^d$ in $d \ge 11$ and simplifies considerably the proof given by Hara in 2008. The method is based on the recent deconvolution strategy of Liu and Slade and uses an $L^p$ version of Hara's induction argument.</description>

      <title>Self-Reinforced Preferential Attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a preferential attachment random graph with self-reinforcement. Each time a new vertex comes in, it attaches itself to an old vertex with a probability that is proportional to the sum of the degrees of that old vertex at all prior times. The resulting growing graph is a random tree whose vertices have degrees that grow polynomially fast in time. We compute the growth exponent, show that it is strictly larger than the growth exponent in the absence of self-reinforcement, and develop insight into how the self-reinforcement affects the growth. Proofs are based on a stochastic approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Tracy-Widom laws for sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of sparse random matrices, the class of random matrices that includes the normalized adjacency matrices of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G(N, p)$. We show that the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue converge to the Tracy-Widom law at a rate almost $O(N^{-1/3 } + p^{-2} N^{-4/3})$ in the regime $p \gg N^{-2/3 }$. Our proof builds upon the Green function comparison method initiated by Erd\H{o}s, Yau, and Yin [22]. To show a Green function comparison theorem for fine spectral scales, we implement algorithms for symbolic computations involving averaged products of Green function entries.</description>

      <title>Tree-structured Ising models under mean parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess advantages of expressing tree-structured Ising models via their mean parameterization rather than their commonly chosen canonical parameterization. This includes fixedness of marginal distributions, often convenient for dependence modeling, and the dispelling of the intractable normalizing constant otherwise hindering Ising models. We derive an analytic expression for the joint probability generating function of mean-parameterized tree-structured Ising models, conferring efficient computation methods for the distribution of the sum of its constituent random variables. The mean parameterization also allows for a stochastic representation of Ising models, providing straightforward sampling methods. We furthermore show that Markov random fields with fixed Poisson marginal distributions may act as an efficient and accurate approximation for tree-structured Ising models, in the spirit of Poisson approximation.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for the eigenvalues of graph Laplacians on data clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an $\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting $\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon - \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical analysis are relaxed.</description>

      <title>The Doeblin-Lenstra conjecture: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish effective convergence rates in the Doeblin-Lenstra law, describing the limiting distribution of approximation coefficients arising from continued fraction convergents of a typical real number. More generally, we prove quantitative versions of the Doeblin-Lenstra law for best approximates in higher dimensions, as well as for points sampled from fractal measures on the real line, including the middle-third Cantor measure.
  Our method reduces the problem to proving effective convergence of Birkhoff averages for diagonal flows on spaces of unimodular lattices. A key step is to show that, despite the discontinuity of the observable of interest, it satisfies the regularity conditions on average required for effective ergodic theorems. For the fractal setting, we establish effective multi-equidistribution properties of self-similar measures under diagonal flow, extending recent work on single equidistribution by B\'enard, He and Zhang. As a consequence, we also obtain central limit theorems for these Diophantine statistics in both classical and fractal settings.</description>

      <title>Existence of Strong Randomized Equilibria in Mean-Field Games of Optimal Stopping with Common Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mean-field game of optimal stopping and investigate the existence of strong solutions via a connection with the Bank-El Karoui's representation problem. Under certain continuity assumptions, where the common noise is generated by a countable partition, we show that a strong randomized mean-field equilibrium exists, in which the mean-field interaction term is adapted to the common noise and the stopping time is randomized. Furthermore, under suitable monotonicity assumptions and for a general common noise, we provide a comparative statics analysis of the set of strong mean-field equilibria with strict equilibrium stopping times.</description>

      <title>Infinite Dimensional Mean-Field Belavkin Equation: Well-posedness and Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the mean-field limit of a stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation arising in quantum optimal control and mean-field games, where N interacting particles undergo continuous indirect measurement. For the open quantum system described by Belavkin's filtering equation, we derive a mean-field approximation under minimal assumptions, extending prior results limited to bounded operators and finitedimensional settings. By establishing global well-posedness via fixed-point methods-avoiding measure-change techniques-we obtain higher regularity solutions. Furthermore, we prove rigorous convergence to the mean-field limit in an infinitedimensional framework. Our work provides the first derivation of such limits for wave functions in $L^2 (R^d)$, with implications for simulating and controlling large quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cycle-factors of regular graphs via entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.</description>

      <title>Wong-Zakai approximation of density functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the Wong-Zakai approximation of probability density functions of solutions at a fixed time of rough differential equations driven by fractional Brownian rough path with Hurst parameter $H$ $(1/4 &lt;H \leq 1/2)$. Besides rough path theory, we use Hu-Watanabe's approximation theorem in the framework of Watanabe's distributional Malliavin calculus. When $H=1/2$, the random rough differential equations coincide with the corresponding Stratonovich-type stochastic differential equations. Even for that case, our main result seems new.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wright Analysis in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a broad class of non-Gaussian measures, $ \mu_\Psi$, associated with a family of generalized Wright functions, $_m\Psi_q$. First, we study these measures in Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$, then define them in an abstract nuclear triple $\mathcal{N}\subset\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{N}'$. We study analyticity, invariance properties, and ergodicity under a particular group of automorphisms. Then we show the existence of an Appell system which allows the extension of the non-Gaussian Hilbert space $L^2(\mu_\Psi)$ to the nuclear triple consisting of test functions' and distributions' spaces, $(\mathcal{N})^{1}\subset L^2(\mu_\Psi)\subset(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$. Furthermore, thanks to the definition of two transformations, $S_{\mu_{\Psi}}$ and $T_{\mu_{\Psi}}$, we study Donsker's delta as an element within $(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$ applying the integral equations fulfilled by $_m\Psi_q$.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the regularization by nonlinear noise for a class of partial differential equations that may only have local solutions. In particular, we obtain the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which provide positive answers to a longstanding open problem in this field.
  Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system. Our main results have broad applications, including stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic surface growth models and stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>A distance theorem for inhomogenous random rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (n - d)}$ be a random matrix with independent uniformly anti-concentrated entries satisfying $\mathbb{E}\lvert A\rvert_{HS}^2 \leq Kn(n-d)$ and let $H$ be the subspace spanned by the columns of $A$. Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a random vector with uniformly anti-concentrated entries. We show that when $1 \leq d \leq \lambda n/\log n$ the distance between between $X$ and $H$ satisfies the following following small ball estimate:
  \[
  \Pr\left( \text{dis}(X,H) \leq t\sqrt{d} \right)
  \leq (Ct)^{d} + e^{-cn},
  \]
  for some constants $\lambda,c,C &gt; 0$. This extends the distance theorems of Rudelson and Vershynin, Livshyts, and Livshyts,Tikhomirov, and Vershynin by dropping any identical distribution assumptions about the entries of $X$ and $A$. Furthermore it can be applied to prove numerous results about random matrices in the inhomogenous setting. These include lower tail estimates on the smallest singular value of rectangular matrices and upper tail estimates on the smallest singular value of square matrices. To obtain a distance theorem for inhomogenous rectangular matrices we introduce a new tool for this new general ensemble of random matrices, Randomized Logarithmic LCD, a natural combination of the Randomized LCD, used in study of smallest singular values of inhomogenous square matrices, and of the Logarithmic LCD, used in the study of no-gaps delocalization of eigenvectors and the smallest singular values of Hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Birth-death processes are time-changed Feller's Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Feller's Brownian motion is a diffusion process on the half-line with general boundary behavior at the origin, described by four parameters. A birth-death process, on the other hand, is a continuous-time Markov chain on the nonnegative integers, characterized by three parameters reflecting its behavior at infinity. This paper aims to build a connection between the two: we show that any Feller's Brownian motion can be transformed into a birth-death process via a specific time change, and vice versa. The transformation identifies a precise correspondence between their parameters. Our approach is based on a pathwise representation of the Feller process and offers a constructive framework for birth-death processes, filling a gap in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value of inhomogenous random rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times n}$ ($N \geq n$) be a random matrix with with independent entries that have mean 0 variance 1 and bounded $2+\beta$ moment. We show that the smallest singular value $\sigma_n(A)$ satisfies
  \[
  \Pr \left(\sigma_n(A) \leq \varepsilon(\sqrt{N+1} - \sqrt{n})\right) \leq (C\varepsilon)^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},
  \]
  for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $c,C$ depend only on $\beta$ and the $2+\beta$ moment. This extends earlier results of Rudelson and Vershynin, who showed that such lower tail estimates held for rectangular matrices with i.i.d. mean 0 subgaussian entries. When the $2+\beta$ moment assumption is replaced with a uniform anti-concentration assumption, $\sup_z \Pr\left(|X-z| &lt; a\right) &lt; b$, we show that
  \[
  \Pr\left(\sigma_n(A) \leq \varepsilon(\sqrt{N+1} - \sqrt{n})\right) \leq (C\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon))^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},
  \]
  where $c,C$ now depend only on $a$ and $b$. This extends more recent work of Livshyts, whose showed that such lower tail estimates held for rectrangular matrices with i.i.d. rows. To prove these results we employ a number of new technical ingredients, including a new deviation inequality for the regularized Hilbert-Schmidt norm and a recently proven small ball estimate for the distance between a random vector and a subspace spanned by an inhomogeneous rectangular matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process $(\int_0^t e^{2b_s-b_t}\, ds\ ;\ t\ge 0)$, where $b$ is a real Brownian motion, is known as the geometric 2M-X Matsumoto--Yor process. Remarkably, it enjoys the Markov property. We provide a generalization of this process in the context of Jordan algebras, and we prove the Markov property for this generalization.
  Our Markov process occurs as a limit of discrete-time AX+B Markov chains on the cone of squares whose invariant probability measures classically yield a Dufresne-type identity for a perpetuity. In particular, the paper provides a generalization to any symmetric cone of the matrix--valued generalization of the Matsumoto--Yor process and Dufresne identity initially developed by Rider--Valk\'o.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spiked random matrix model obtained by applying a function entrywise to a signal-plus-noise symmetric data matrix. We prove that the largest eigenvalue of this model, which we call a transformed spiked Wigner matrix, exhibits Baik-Ben Arous--P\'ech\'e (BBP) type phase transition. We show that the law of the fluctuation converges to the Gaussian distribution when the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is above the critical number, and to the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution when the effective SNR is below the critical number. We provide precise formulas for the limiting distributions and also concentration estimates for the largest eigenvalues, both in the supercritical and the subcritical regimes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the classical Yosida approximation by utilizing a nonstandard duality mapping to establish the existence and uniqueness of both (probabilistically) weak and strong solutions and demonstrate the continuous dependence on initial values for a class of multi-valued stochastic evolution inclusions within the variational framework.
  Furthermore, leveraging this generalized Yosida approximation, we derive the finite-time extinction of solutions with probability one and also provide an explicit upper bound of the moment of extinction time for multi-valued stochastic evolution inclusions perturbed by linear multiplicative noise. The main results are applicable to various examples, including multi-valued stochastic porous media equations, stochastic $\Phi$-Laplace equations and stochastic evolution inclusions involving subdifferentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how Langevin diffusions can be interpreted in the context of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with structure-preserving noise and dissipation on reductive Lie groups. Reductive Lie groups provide the setting in which the Lie group structure is compatible with Riemannian structures, via the existence of bi-invariant metrics. This structure allows for the explicit construction of Riemannian Brownian motion via symplectic techniques, which permits the study of Langevin diffusions with noise in the position coordinate as well as Langevin diffusions with noise in both momentum and position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limit distribution of the volume fraction estimator $\widehat p_{\lambda, A}$ (= the Lebesgue measure of the intersection $\mathcal{X}\cap (\lambda A)$ of a random set $\mathcal{X}$ with a large observation set $\lambda A$, divided by the Lebesgue measure of $\lambda A$), as $\lambda \to \infty$, for a Boolean set $\mathcal{X}$ formed by uniformly scattered random grains $\Xi \subset \mathbb{R}^\nu$. We obtain general conditions on generic grain set $\Xi$ under which $\widehat p_{\lambda, A}$ has an $\alpha$-stable limit distribution with index $1 &lt; \alpha \le 2$. A large class of Boolean models with randomly homothetic grains satisfying these conditions is introduced. We also discuss the limit distribution of the sample volume fraction of a Boolean set
  observed on a large subset of a $\nu_0$-dimensional $(1 \le \nu_0 \le \nu -1$) hyperplane of $\mathbb{R}^\nu$.</description>

      <title>Balanced multi-species spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ''balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. For the Ising case, this generalizes an inequality recently found by Issa in the context of vector spin models. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.</description>

Abstract: We consider a random walk amongst positive random conductances on $\mathbb{Z}^d, d \ge 2$, with directional bias. When the conductances have a stable distribution with parameter $\gamma \in (0, 1)$, the walk is sub-ballistic. In this regime Fribergh and Kious (Ann. Prob. 2018) derived an annealed scaling limit for the appropriately rescaled walk towards the Fractional Kinetics process. We prove the quenched version of this result for all $d \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time modeling and bootstrap for chain-ladder reserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the famous Mack's model which gives an estimate for the conditional mean squared error of prediction of the chain-ladder claims reserves. We introduce a stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion to model the accumulated total claims amount for the chain-ladder method. Within this continuous-time framework, we propose a bootstrap technique for estimating the distribution of claims reserves. It turns out that our approach leads to inherently capturing asymmetry and non-negativity, eliminating the necessity for additional assumptions. We conclude with a case study and comparative analysis against alternative methodologies based on Mack's model.</description>

      <title>On determinantal point processes with nonsymmetric kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs for short) are a class of repulsive point processes. They have found some statistical applications to model spatial point pattern datasets with repulsion between close points. In the case of DPPs on finite sets, they are defined by a matrix called the DPP kernel which is usually assumed to be symmetric. While there are a few known examples of DPPs with nonsymmetric kernels, not much is known on how this affects their usual properties. In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt the results on $P_0$ matrices to the DPP setting in order to get necessary and sufficient conditions for the well-definedness of DPPs with nonsymmetric kernels. We also generalize various common results on DPPs. We then show how to use these results to construct attractive couplings of regular DPPs with symmetric kernels in order to model spatial marked point patterns with repulsion between points of the same mark and attraction between points of different marks.</description>

      <title>$L^{p}$ Mild Solution to Stochastic Incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global $L^{p}$ mild solution of inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the torus $\mathbb{T}^{N}$ with $N&lt;p&lt;6$, $ 1 \leqslant N \leqslant 3$, driven by the Wiener Process. We introduce a new iteration scheme coupled the density $\rho$ and the velocity $\mathbf{u}$ to linearize the system, which defines a semigroup. Notably, unlike semigroups dependent solely on $x$, the generators of this semigroup depend on both time $t$ and space $x$. After demonstrating the properties of this time- and space-dependent semigroup, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of mild solution, employing the semigroup theory and Banach's fixed point theorem. Finally, we show the global existence of mild solutions by Zorn's lemma. Moreover, for the stochastic case, we need to use the operator splitting method to do some estimates separately.</description>

      <title>DLR Equations for the Superstable Bose Gas at any Temperature and Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a thermodynamic limit for the grand canonical Bose gas in dimension $d\geqslant1$ (in its Feynman-Kac representation) with superstable interaction at any inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and any chemical potential $\mu\in\RR$. Our infinite volume model is naturally a distribution over configurations of finite loops and possibly interlacements. We prove the limiting process to solve a new class of DLR equations involving random permutations and Brownian paths.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969) and Central Limit Theorems were proved by several authors \cites{Ibragimov, Misevicius, Morita, Vallee}. In this work, we develop a new approach towards quantifying the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods apply to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). Further, we prove a Central Limit Theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Unlike previous approaches to the one-dimensional problem, our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>A two-player zero-sum probabilistic game that approximates the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new two-player zero-sum game whose value function approximates the level set formulation for the geometric evolution by mean curvature of a hypersurface. In our approach the game is played with symmetric rules for the two players and probability theory is involved (the game is not deterministic).</description>
