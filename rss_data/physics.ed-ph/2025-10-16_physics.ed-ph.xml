      <title>Introductory Physics Students in Algebra-based Courses Who Typically Worked Alone or in Groups: Insights from Gender-Based Analysis before and during COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration with peers both inside and outside the classroom can be an invaluable tool for helping students learn physics. We investigated the impact of peer collaboration on learning physics by examining the characteristics of women and men who typically worked alone versus those who typically collaborated with peers in their algebra-based introductory physics course when they took the course before and during the COVID-19 pandemic when the classes were on Zoom. Our findings indicate that, on average, students who worked with peers had higher grades and reported greater peer influence on their physics self-efficacy during the pandemic compared to those who worked alone. We also observed that, for both women and men, a larger percentage of students typically worked in groups before the pandemic, while a greater percentage typically worked alone during the pandemic. We discuss these results in relation to students' prior academic preparation, physics grades, self-efficacy and their perception of the effectiveness of peer collaboration on their physics self-efficacy.</description>

      <title>Using Unguided Peer Collaboration to Facilitate Early Educators' Pedagogical Development: An Example from Physics TA Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many early career educators, such as teaching assistants (TAs) in college courses, as well as pre-college educators, need help both with content and pedagogical knowledge to effectively help their students learn. One pedagogical approach that has been found effective in prior studies is collaboration with peers. Collaborative learning not only has the potential to help educators develop content knowledge but can also improve their pedagogical knowledge. This study examines the performance of physics graduate students, enrolled in a professional development course for teaching assistants (TAs), on the Magnetism Conceptual Survey, highlighting the impact of peer collaboration on learning both content and pedagogy. Peer interaction significantly improved performance, driven by both construction of knowledge (where the group answered a question correctly but only one member had the correct individual response) and co-construction of knowledge (where the group succeeded despite both members initially answering incorrectly). Beyond improving content understanding, peer collaboration can also foster pedagogical skills by encouraging early educators such as TAs to use peers as learning resources and communicate ideas effectively to support mutual understanding. These dual benefits-enhancing both content mastery and teaching abilities-demonstrate that this approach holds value not only for the professional development of TAs but can also be adapted for pre-college professional development programs to improve teaching and learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>FeynCraft: A Game of Feynman Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeynCraft is a browser-based game that is designed to teach players the particle interactions of the Standard Model of particle physics, and how to link these interactions together to produce valid Feynman diagrams. It is primarily targeted at undergraduates and lecturers in introductory courses in particle physics, but we anticipate that it should also be useful for school pupils and teachers studying the basics of particle physics, and perhaps also current researchers. Users may draw particle lines and link them together to form vertices and complete diagrams, and FeynCraft determines invalid vertices using a sequence of simple rules, showing users which vertices are invalid and why. Diagrams may be drawn that involve both fundamental Standard Model particles and hadrons (where hadrons are represented by their constituent quark content). Users can also be presented with a process for which they must draw valid Feynman diagrams -- FeynCraft is able to generate such 'problems' at random, but there is also the facility to create, share, import and solve curated sets of problems. Alternatively, one is able to specify the process, and ask FeynCraft itself to generate the Feynman diagrams. Finally, we include several overlay options that give more information on a Feynman diagram (e.g. QCD colour flow, interaction strengths), and the option to export a drawn diagram as LaTeX code.</description>

      <title>Reflections of quantum educators on strategies to diversify the second quantum revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on reflections and suggestions of five college quantum educators from four different institutions (two from same institution) regarding what can be done to diversify the second quantum revolution. They are leading QIST researchers, and very passionate about improving quantum education. The educators were asked about their thoughts on whether the interdisciplinary nature of the field, in which nobody can claim to be an expert in all aspects of QIST, may make it easier to create a better culture from the beginning, supportive of equitable participation of diverse groups unlike physics. This is because disciplines such as physics have an ingrained inequitable culture based on brilliance attribution that is a major impediment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Educators were interviewed on Zoom using a semi-structured think-aloud protocol about various issues related to QIST education including those pertaining to how to diversify the second quantum revolution. Their suggestions can be invaluable and can help other educators adapt and implement strategies to diversify QIST.</description>
