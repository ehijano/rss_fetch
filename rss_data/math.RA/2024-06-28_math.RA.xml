      <title>Yang-Baxter equations and relative Rota-Baxter operators for left-Alia algebras associated to invariant theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left-Alia algebras are a class of algebras with symmetric Jacobi identities. They contain several typical types of algebras as subclasses, and are closely related to the invariant theory. In this paper, we study the construction theory of left-Alia bialgebras. We introduce the notion of the left-Alia Yang-Baxter equation. We show that an antisymmetric solution of the left-Alia Yang-Baxter equation gives rise to a left-Alia bialgebra that we call triangular. The notions of relative Rota-Baxter operators of left-Alia algebras and pre-left-Alia algebras are introduced to provide antisymmetric solutions of the left-Alia Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Distributive lattices of varieties of Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a variety of Novikov algebras has a distributive lattice of subvarieties if and only if the lattice of its subvarieties defined by identities of degree three is distributive, thus answering, in the case of Novikov algebras, a question of Bokut from about fifty years ago. As a byproduct, we classify all Koszul operads with one binary generator of which the Novikov operad is a quotient.</description>

      <title>Group gradings on finite-dimensional incidence algebras. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the description of group gradings on finite-dimensional incidence algebras. Moreover, we classify the finite-dimensional graded algebras that can be realized as incidence algebras endowed with a group grading.</description>

      <title>Group gradings on triangularizable algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifying isomorphism classes of group gradings on algebras presents a compelling challenge, particularly within the realms of non-simple and infinite-dimensional algebras, which have been relatively unexplored. This study focuses on a kind of algebra that is neither simple nor finite-dimensional, aiming to classify the group gradings on triangularizable algebras as defined by Mesyan in 2019. The topology of infinite-dimensional algebras, along with the role of idempotent elements, plays a crucial role in our findings, leading to new insights and a deeper understanding of their structure.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dimensional Mathematics: A Foundation For STP/STA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new mathematical structure, called the cross-dimensional mathematics (CDM), is proposed. The CDM considered in this paper consists of three parts: hyper algebra, hyper geometry, and hyper Lie group/Lie algebra. Hyper algebra proposes some new algebraic structures such as hyper group, hyper ring, and hyper module over matrices and vectors with mixed dimensions (MVMDs). They have sets of classical groups, rings, and modules as their components and cross-dimensional connections among their components. Their basic properties are investigated. Hyper geometry starts from mixed dimensional Euclidian space, and hyper vector space. Then the hyper topological vector space, hyper inner product space, and hyper manifold are constructed. They have a joined cross-dimensional geometric structure. Finally, hyper metric space, topological hyper group and hyper Lie algebra are built gradually, and finally, the corresponding hyper Lie group is introduced. All these concepts are built over MVMDs, and to reach our purpose in addition to existing semi-tensor products (STPs) and semi-tensor additions (STAs), a couple of most general STP and STA are introduced. Some existing structures/results about STPs/STAs have also been resumed and integrated into this CDM.</description>

      <title>Symmetric monoidal categories of conveniently-constructible Banach bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a continuously-normed Banach bundle $\mathcal{E}$ over a compact Hausdorff space $X$ whose space of sections is algebraically finitely-generated (f.g.) over $C(X)$ is locally trivial (and hence the section space is projective f.g over $C(X)$); this answers a question of I. Gogi\'c. As a preliminary we also provide sufficient conditions for a quotient bundle to be continuous phrased in terms of the Vietoris continuity of the unit-ball maps attached to the bundles. Related results include (a) the fact that the category of topologically f.g. continuous Banach bundles over $X$ is symmetric monoidal under the (fiber-wise-maximal) tensor product, (b) the full faithfulness of the global-section functor from topologically f.g. continuous bundles to $C(X)$-modules and (c) the consequent identification of the algebraically f.g. bundles as precisely the rigid objects in the aforementioned symmetric monoidal category.</description>
