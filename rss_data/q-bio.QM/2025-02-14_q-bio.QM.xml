      <title>Trajectory Inference for Single Cell Omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory inference is used to order single-cell omics data along a path that reflects a continuous transition between cells. This approach is useful for studying processes like cell differentiation, where a stem cell matures into a specialized cell type, or investigating state changes in pathological conditions. In the current article, we provide a general introduction to trajectory inference, explaining the concepts and assumptions underlying the different methods. We then briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different trajectory inference methods. We also describe best practices for using trajectory inference, such as how to validate the results and how to interpret them in the context of biological knowledge. Finally, the article will discuss some of the applications of trajectory inference in single-cell omics research. These applications include studying cell differentiation, development, and disease. We provide examples of how trajectory inference has been used to gain new insights into these processes.</description>

      <title>Persistent Sheaf Laplacian Analysis of Protein Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein flexibility, measured by the B-factor or Debye-Waller factor, is essential for protein functions such as structural support, enzyme activity, cellular communication, and molecular transport. Theoretical analysis and prediction of protein flexibility are crucial for protein design, engineering, and drug discovery. In this work, we introduce the persistent sheaf Laplacian (PSL), an effective tool in topological data analysis, to model and analyze protein flexibility. By representing the local topology and geometry of protein atoms through the multiscale harmonic and non-harmonic spectra of PSLs, the proposed model effectively captures protein flexibility and provides accurate, robust predictions of protein B-factors. Our PSL model demonstrates an increase in accuracy of 32% compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, we construct a blind machine learning prediction method utilizing global and local protein features. Extensive computations and comparisons validate the effectiveness of the proposed PSL model for B-factor predictions.</description>

      <title>DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Models in Biology and Life Sciences: Sources, Developments, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocality is important in realistic mathematical models of physical and biological systems when local models fail to capture the essential dynamics and interactions that occur over a range of distances. This review illustrates different nonlocal mathematical models applied to biology and life sciences. The major focus has been given to sources, developments, and applications of such models. Among other things, a systematic discussion has been provided for the conditions of pattern formations in biological systems of population dynamics. Special attention has also been given to nonlocal interactions on networks, network coupling and integration, including brain dynamics models that provide an important tool to understand neurodegenerative diseases better. In addition, we have discussed nonlocal modelling approaches for cancer stem cells and tumor cells that are widely applied in the cell migration processes, growth, and avascular tumors in any organ. Furthermore, the discussed nonlocal continuum models can go sufficiently smaller scales, including nanotechnology, where classical local models often fail to capture the complexities of nanoscale interactions, applied to build biosensors to sense biomaterial and its concentration. Piezoelectric and other smart materials are among them, and these devices are becoming increasingly important in the digital and physical world that is intrinsically interconnected with biological systems. Additionally, we have reviewed a nonlocal theory of peridynamics, which deals with continuous and discrete media and applies to model the relationship between fracture and healing in cortical bone, tissue growth and shrinkage, and other areas increasingly important in biomedical and bioengineering applications. Finally, we provided a comprehensive summary of emerging trends and highlighted future directions in this rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <title>Automated Cell Structure Extraction for 3D Electron Microscopy by Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the 3D structures of cells and tissues is crucial in biology. Sequential cross-sectional images from electron microscopy provide high-resolution intracellular structure information. The segmentation of complex cell structures remains a laborious manual task for experts, demanding time and effort. This bottleneck in analyzing biological images requires efficient and automated solutions. In this study, the deep learning-based automated segmentation of biological images was explored to enable accurate reconstruction of the 3D structures of cells and organelles. An analysis system for the cell images of Cyanidioschyzon merolae, a primitive unicellular red algae, was constructed. This system utilizes sequential cross-sectional images captured by a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). A U-Net was adopted and training was performed to identify and segment cell organelles from single-cell images. In addition, the segment anything model (SAM) and 3D watershed algorithm were employed to extract individual 3D images of each cell from large-scale microscope images containing numerous cells. Finally, the trained U-Net was applied to segment each structure within these 3D images. Through this procedure, the creation of 3D cell models could be fully automated. The adoption of other deep learning techniques and combinations of image processing methods will also be explored to enhance the segmentation accuracy further.</description>

      <title>A Simple yet Effective DDG Predictor is An Unsupervised Antibody Optimizer and Explainer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proteins that exist today have been optimized over billions of years of natural evolution, during which nature creates random mutations and selects them. The discovery of functionally promising mutations is challenged by the limited evolutionary accessible regions, i.e., only a small region on the fitness landscape is beneficial. There have been numerous priors used to constrain protein evolution to regions of landscapes with high-fitness variants, among which the change in binding free energy (DDG) of protein complexes upon mutations is one of the most commonly used priors. However, the huge mutation space poses two challenges: (1) how to improve the efficiency of DDG prediction for fast mutation screening; and (2) how to explain mutation preferences and efficiently explore accessible evolutionary regions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight DDG predictor (Light-DDG), which adopts a structure-aware Transformer as the backbone and enhances it by knowledge distilled from existing powerful but computationally heavy DDG predictors. Additionally, we augmented, annotated, and released a large-scale dataset containing millions of mutation data for pre-training Light-DDG. We find that such a simple yet effective Light-DDG can serve as a good unsupervised antibody optimizer and explainer. For the target antibody, we propose a novel Mutation Explainer to learn mutation preferences, which accounts for the marginal benefit of each mutation per residue. To further explore accessible evolutionary regions, we conduct preference-guided antibody optimization and evaluate antibody candidates quickly using Light-DDG to identify desirable mutations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Global Genomic Surveillance for Early Detection of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Global viral threats underscore the need for effective genomic surveillance, but high costs and uneven resource distribution hamper its implementation. Targeting surveillance to international travelers in major travel hubs may offer a more efficient strategy for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.
  Methods: We developed and calibrated a multiple-strain metapopulation model of global SARS-CoV-2 transmission using extensive epidemiological, phylogenetic, and high-resolution air travel data. We then compared baseline surveillance with various resource-allocation approaches that prioritize travelers, focusing on Omicron BA.1/BA.2 retrospectively and on hypothetical future variants under different emergence, transmission and vaccine effectiveness scenarios.
  Findings: Focusing existing surveillance resources on travelers at key global hubs significantly shortened detection delays without increasing total surveillance efforts. In retrospective analyses of Omicron BA.1/BA.2, traveler-targeted approaches consistently outperformed baseline strategies, even when overall resources were reduced. Simulations indicate that focusing surveillance on key travel hubs outperform baseline practices in detecting future variants, across different possible origins, even with reduced resources. This approach also remains effective in future pandemic scenarios with varying reproductive numbers and vaccine effectiveness.
  Interpretation: These findings provide a quantitative, cost-effective framework for strengthening global genomic surveillance. By reallocating resources toward international travelers in select travel hubs, early detection of emerging variants can be enhanced, informing rapid public health interventions and bolstering preparedness for future pandemics.</description>
