      <title>FengHuang: Next-Generation Memory Orchestration for AI Inferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a vision for a novel AI infrastructure design that has been initially validated through inference simulations on state-of-the-art large language models. Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions.</description>

      <title>HPCAgentTester: A Multi-Agent LLM Approach for Enhanced HPC Unit Test Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit testing in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is critical but challenged by parallelism, complex algorithms, and diverse hardware. Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems.</description>

      <title>UFO$^3$: Weaving the Digital Agent Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are transforming digital devices from passive tools into proactive intelligent collaborators. However, most existing frameworks remain confined to a single OS or device, making cross-device workflows brittle and largely manual. We present UFO$^3$, a system that unifies heterogeneous endpoints, desktops, servers, mobile devices, and edge, into a single orchestration fabric. UFO$^3$ models each user request as a mutable TaskConstellation: a distributed DAG of atomic subtasks (TaskStars) with explicit control and data dependencies (TaskStarLines). The TaskConstellation continuously evolves as results stream in from distributed devices, enabling asynchronous execution, adaptive recovery, and dynamic optimization. A Constellation Orchestrator} executes tasks safely and asynchronously while applying dynamic DAG updates, and the Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP) provides persistent, low-latency channels for reliable task dispatch and result streaming. These designs dissolve the traditional boundaries between devices and platforms, allowing agents to collaborate seamlessly and amplify their collective intelligence.
  We evaluate UFO$^3$ on NebulaBench, a benchmark of 55 cross-device tasks across 5 machines and 10 categories. UFO$^3$ achieves 83.3% subtask completion, 70.9% task success, exposes parallelism with an average width of 1.72, and reduces end-to-end latency by 31% relative to a sequential baseline. Fault-injection experiments demonstrate graceful degradation and recovery under transient and permanent agent failures. These results show that UFO$^3$ achieves accurate, efficient, and resilient task orchestration across heterogeneous devices, uniting isolated agents into a coherent, adaptive computing fabric that extends across the landscape of ubiquitous computing.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exascale: Dataflow Domain Translation on a Cerebras Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is essential in many scientific and engineering domains. Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to deliver high simulation rate or high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads. This paper introduces the novel \algorithmpropernoun{} algorithm, designed to overcome these limitations. We apply this method and show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second and simulations achieving 84 PFLOP/s. Our implementation can achieve 90\% of peak performance in both single-node and clustered environments. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale running on a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems.</description>

      <title>EarthSight: A Distributed Framework for Low-Latency Satellite Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.</description>

      <title>Cascading Bandits With Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>SemanticNN: Compressive and Error-Resilient Semantic Offloading for Extremely Weak Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>SMART: A Surrogate Model for Predicting Application Runtime in Dragonfly Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Convergence Analysis for Semi-Decentralized Learning: Sampled-to-Sampled vs. Sampled-to-All Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. With the introduction of two novel metrics, qubit utilization efficiency and quantum model training strategy, we present a thorough analysis of the current status of the QFL research. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of QC on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.</description>

      <title>To Offload or Not To Offload: Model-driven Comparison of Edge-native and On-device Processing In the Era of Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational offloading is a promising approach for overcoming resource constraints on client devices by moving some or all of an application's computations to remote servers. With the advent of specialized hardware accelerators, client devices can now perform fast local processing of specific tasks, such as machine learning inference, reducing the need for offloading computations. However, edge servers with accelerators also offer faster processing for offloaded tasks than was previously possible. In this paper, we present an analytic and experimental comparison of on-device processing and edge offloading for a range of accelerator, network, multi-tenant, and application workload scenarios, with the goal of understanding when to use local on-device processing and when to offload computations. We present models that leverage analytical queuing results to derive explainable closed-form equations for the expected end-to-end latencies of both strategies, which yield precise, quantitative performance crossover predictions that guide adaptive offloading. We experimentally validate our models across a range of scenarios and show that they achieve a mean absolute percentage error of 2.2% compared to observed latencies. We further use our models to develop a resource manager for adaptive offloading and show its effectiveness under variable network conditions and dynamic multi-tenant edge settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing parallel programs for distributed systems is a complex task, often requiring significant code modifications. Task-based programming systems improve modularity by separating performance decisions from application logic, but their mapping interfaces are low-level. We introduce Mapple, a high-level, declarative programming interface for mapping distributed applications. Mapple provides transformation primitives to resolve dimensionality mismatches between task and processor spaces, including a key primitive, decompose, that helps minimize communication volume. We implement Mapple on top of the Legion runtime by translating Mapple mappers into its low-level C++ interface. Across nine applications, including six matrix multiplication algorithms and three scientific computing workloads, Mapple reduces mapper code size by 14x and enables performance improvements of up to 1.34x over expert-written C++ mappers. In addition, the decompose primitive achieves up to 1.83x improvement over existing dimensionality-resolution heuristics.</description>

      <title>SLICE: SLO-Driven Scheduling for LLM Inference on Edge Computing Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), as the foundational architecture for next-generation interactive AI applications, not only power intelligent dialogue systems but also drive the evolution of embodied intelligence on edge devices, including humanoid robots, smart vehicles, and other scenarios. The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs.
  This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.</description>

      <title>Resolving Conflicts with Grace: Dynamically Concurrent Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a \emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it \emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.</description>

      <title>Intelligence per Watt: Measuring Intelligence Efficiency of Local AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07885</link>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (&lt;=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.</description>

      <title>STAGE: A Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator for distributed AI system co-design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE is publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems: https://github.com/astra-sim/symbolic tensor graph</description>

      <title>Quantum resources in resource management systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing resources are increasingly being incorporated into high-performance computing (HPC) environments as co-processors for hybrid workloads. To support this paradigm, quantum devices must be treated as schedulable first-class resources within existing HPC infrastructure. This enables consistent workload management, unified resource visibility, and support for hybrid quantum-classical job execution models.
  This paper presents a reference architecture and implementation for the integration of quantum computing resources, both on-premises and cloud-hosted into HPC centers via standard workload managers. We introduce a Slurm plugin designed to abstract and control quantum backends, enabling seamless resource scheduling, minimizing queue duplication, and supporting job co-scheduling with classical compute nodes. The architecture supports heterogeneous quantum resources and can be extended to any workload (and container) management systems.</description>

      <title>Views: a hardware-friendly graph database model for storing semantic information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The graph database (GDB) is an increasingly common storage model for data involving relationships between entries. Beyond its widespread usage in database industries, the advantages of GDBs indicate a strong potential in constructing symbolic artificial intelligences (AIs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where knowledge of data inter-relationships takes a critical role in implementation. However, current GDB models are not optimised for hardware acceleration, leading to bottlenecks in storage capacity and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly GDB model, called Views. We show its data structure and organisation tailored for efficient storage and retrieval of graph data and demonstrate its functional equivalence and storage performance advantage compared to represent traditional graph representations. We further demonstrate its symbolic processing abilities in semantic reasoning and cognitive modelling with practical examples and provide a short perspective on future developments.</description>

      <title>How Exclusive are Ethereum Transactions? Evidence from non-winning blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over an eight-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive -- appearing only in blocks from a single builder -- or private -- absent from the public mempool but included in blocks from multiple builders. We find that, depending on the methodology, exclusive transactions account for between 77.2% and 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Moreover, we show that exclusivity cannot be fully attributed to persistent relationships between senders and builders: only between 7% and 8.4% of all on-chain exclusive transaction value originates from senders who route exclusively to one builder. Finally, we observe that transaction exclusivity is dynamic. Some transactions are exclusive at the start of a bidding cycle but later appear in blocks from multiple builders. Other transactions remain exclusive to a losing builder for two or three cycles before appearing in the public mempool. These transactions are therefore delayed and then exposed to potential attacks.</description>
