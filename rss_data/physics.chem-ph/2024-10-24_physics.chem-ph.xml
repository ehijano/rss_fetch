      <title>Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning Unlock Possibilities in Beauty Design -- A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational molecular design -- the endeavor to design molecules, with various missions, aided by machine learning and molecular dynamics approaches, has been widely applied to create valuable new molecular entities, from small molecule therapeutics to protein biologics. In the small data regime, physics-based approaches model the interaction between the molecule being designed and proteins of key physiological functions, providing structural insights into the mechanism. When abundant data has been collected, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) can be more directly constructed from experimental data, from which machine learning can distill key insights to guide the design of the next round of experiment design. Machine learning methodologies can also facilitate physical modeling, from improving the accuracy of force fields and extending them to unseen chemical spaces, to more directly enhancing the sampling on the conformational spaces. We argue that these techniques are mature enough to be applied to not just extend the longevity of life, but the beauty it manifests. In this perspective, we review the current frontiers in the research \&amp; development of skin care products, as well as the statistical and physical toolbox applicable to addressing the challenges in this industry. Feasible interdisciplinary research projects are proposed to harness the power of machine learning tools to design innovative, effective, and inexpensive skin care products.</description>

      <title>OWPCP: A Deep Learning Model to Predict Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physicochemical properties of chemical compounds have great importance in several areas, including pharmaceuticals, environmental and separation science. Among these are physicochemical properties such as the octanol-water partition coefficient, which has been considered an important index pointing out lipophilicity and hydrophilicity. It affects drug absorption and membrane permeability. Following Lipinski's rule of five, logP was identified as one of the key determinants of the stability of chemical entities and, as such, needed state-of-the-art methods for measuring lipophilicity. This paper presents a deep-learning model, OWPCP, developed to compute logP using Morgan fingerprints and MACCS keys as input features. It uses the interconnection of such molecular representations with logP values extracted from 26,254 compounds. The dataset was prepared to contain a wide range of chemical structures with differing molecular weights and polar surface area. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using the Keras Tuner alongside the Hyperband algorithm to enhance the performance. OWPCP demonstrated outstanding performance compared to current computational methods, achieving an MAE=0.247 on the test set and outperforming all previous DL models. Remarkably, while one of the most accurate recent models is based on experimental data on retention time to make predictions, OWPCP manages computing logP efficiently without depending on these factors, being, therefore, very useful during early-stage drug discovery. Our model outperforms the best model, which leverages Retention Time, and our model does not require any experimental data. Further validation of the model performance was done across different functional groups, and it showed very high accuracy, especially for compounds that contain aliphatic OH groups. The results have indicated that OWPCP provides a reliable prediction of logP.</description>

      <title>CH(A) Radical Formation in Coulomb Explosion from Butane Seeded Plasma Generated with Chirp-Controlled Ultrashort Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally studied the formation of CH(A) radicals in butane seeded plasma generated with chirp-controlled ultrashort laser pulses (\(\sim 760 \, \mu \text{J}/\text{pulse}\), 890 nm, 1 kHz, 8 fs). The focused beam with high peak intensity (\(\sim 10^{14} - 10^{16} \, \text{W/cm}^2\)) caused Coulomb explosion (CE). The time dependent emission spectra were observed with the Fourier-transform Visible spectroscopy (FTVis) step-scan method. The average signal intensity decreased with the chirp in the Ar\(^+\) &gt; C\(_2\) &gt; H-\(\alpha\) \(\sim\) CH(A) order with a plateau for CH(A) in the \(-200\) to \(-100 \, \text{fs}^2\) range. The short rise time of the CH(A) emission signal, the monoexponential emission decay, and the nearly constant rotational and vibrational temperatures of the CH(A) radicals (\(\sim 3000 \, \text{K}\) and \(\sim 3800 \, \text{K}\)) all support their formation as a primary product. Our TDDFT calculations predict that CH and many other fragments can be formed beyond CE at \(\sim 7 \times 10^{14} \, \text{W/cm}^2\) intensity. The average charge of CH (+0.6) and its relative abundance (0.5\%) support the formation of detectable CH(A) within 120 fs.</description>

      <title>Generative Design of Functional Metal Complexes Utilizing the Internal Knowledge of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing functional transition metal complexes (TMCs) faces challenges due to the vast search space of metals and ligands, requiring efficient optimization strategies. Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly used, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical objectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA tasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single- and multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses traditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during their extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs utilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming those focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies eight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200 candidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into multi-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new ligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained foundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee broad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and materials design.</description>

      <title>Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method for cavity-QED matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to cavity quantum-electrodynamical (QED) matter systems. The method can be formulated in both the Coulomb and the dipole gauge. We verify its accuracy by benchmarking calculations on a set of small molecules against full configuration interaction and state-of-the-art QED coupled cluster (QED-CCSD) calculations. Our results show that (i) gauge invariance can be achieved within correlation-consistent Gaussian basis sets, (ii) the accuracy of QED-CCSD can be enhanced significantly by adding the standard perturbative triples correction without light-matter coupling, and (iii) there is a straightforward way to evaluate the differential expression for the photon occupation number that works in any gauge. The high accuracy and favorable computational scaling of our AFQMC approach will enable a broad range of applications. Besides polaritonic chemistry, the method opens a way to simulate extended QED matter systems.</description>

      <title>Semiconductive and Ferromagnetic Lanthanide MXenes Derived from Carbon Intercalated Two-dimensional Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors are a key focus in developing next-generation information storage technologies. MXenes, as emerging 2D early transition metal carbides and nitrides, offer versatile compositions and tunable chemical structures. Incorporating lanthanide metals, with their unique role of 4f-electrons in engineering physical properties, into MXenes holds potential for advancing technological applications. However, the scarcity of lanthanide-containing ternary MAX phase precursors and the propensity of lanthanides to oxidize pose significant challenges to obtain lanthanide MXenes (Ln2CT2) via the top-down etching method. Here, we propose a general bottom-up methodology for lanthanide MXenes, that derive from carbon intercalated van der Waals building blocks of 2D halides. Compared to conventional MXenes conductors, the synthesized Ln2CT2 exhibit tunable band gaps spanning 0.32 eV to 1.22 eV that cover typical semiconductors such as Si (1.12 eV) and Ge (0.67 eV). Additionally, the presence of unpaired f-electrons endows Ln2CT2 with intrinsic ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures ranging between 36 K and 60 K. Theoretical calculations reveal that, in contrast to traditional MXenes, the number of d-electrons states around the Fermi level are largely diminishes in bare Ln2C MXenes, and the halogen terminals can further exhaust these electrons to open band gaps. Meanwhile, the Ln-4f electrons in Ln2CT2 are highly localized and stay away from the Fermi level, contributing to the spin splitting for the observed ferromagnetic behavior. Lanthanide MXenes hold immense promise for revolutionizing future applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>How to correct Ehrenfest nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems: Ehrenfest plus random force (E$+$$\sigma$) dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One key challenge in the study of nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems is to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. Although Ehrenfest dynamics (ED) is computationally efficient and well-suited for large complex systems, ED often yields inaccurate results. To address these limitations, we improve the accuracy of the traditional ED by adding a random force (E$+$$\sigma$). In this work, the construction of random forces is considered in Markovian and non-Markovian scenarios, and we ensure the dynamics satisfy the detailed balance in both scenarios. By comparing our E$+$$\sigma$ with existing methods such as the electronic friction model and surface hopping, we furthermore validate its reliability. In addition, E$+$$\sigma$ model still retains the high efficiency of ED and does not incur much additional computation. We believe that this method provides an alternative to accurately describe mixed quantum-classical dynamics in open quantum systems, particularly for large complex systems.</description>

      <title>Atomistic understanding of hydrogen coverage on RuO2(110) surface under electrochemical conditions from ab initio statistical thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dehydrogenation of transition metal oxide surfaces under electrochemical potential is critical to the control of important chemical processes such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using first principles computations, we model the thermodynamic dehydrogenation process on RuO$_2$(110) and compare the results to experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) on single crystal. We use a cluster expansion model trained on *ab initio* energy data coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to derive the macroscopic electrochemical observables, i.e., experimental CV, from the energetics of different hydrogen coverage microstates on well-defined RuO$_2$(110). Our model reproduces the unique "two-peaks" cyclic voltammogram observed experimentally with current density peak positions and shapes in good qualitative agreement. We show that RuO$_2$(110) starts as a water-covered surface with hydrogen on bridge (BRG) and coordination-unsaturated sites (CUS) at low potential (less than 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). As the potential increases, the hydrogens on BRG desorb, becoming the main contributor to the first CV peak with smaller contributions from CUS. When all BRG hydrogens are desorbed (before 1.2 V vs. RHE), the remaining CUS hydrogens desorb abruptly in a very small potential window leading to the sharp second peak observed during CV. Our work shows that above 1.23 V, the OER proceeds on a fully dehydrogenated RuO$_2$(110) surface.</description>

      <title>Lead-free Hybrid Perovskite: An Efficient Room Temperature Spin Generator via Large Interfacial Rashba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) demonstates great potential for developing flexible and wearable spintronic devices, by serving as spin sources via the bulk Rashba effect (BRE). However, the practical application of BRE in 2D HOIP faces huge challenges, particularly due to the toxicity of lead, which is crucial for achieving large spin-orbit coupling, and the restrictions in 2D HOIP candidates to meet specific symmetry-breaking requirements. To overcome these obstacles, we design a strategy to exploit the interfacial Rashba effect (IRE) of lead-free 2D HOIP (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2CuCl4 (PEA-CuCl), manifesting as an efficient spin generator at room temperature. IRE of PEA-CuCl originates from the large orbital hybridization at the interface between PEA-CuCl and adjacent ferromagnetic layers. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements further quantify a large Rashba effective field of 14.04 Oe per 10^11 A m-2, surpassing those of lead-based HOIP and traditional all-inorganic heterojunctions with noble metals. Our lead-free 2D HOIP PEA-CuCl, which harnesses large IRE for spin generation, is efficient, nontoxic, and economic, offering huge promise for future flexible and wearable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Surface magnetic stabilization and the photo-emission chiral-induced spin-selectivity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spinterface mechanism was suggested as a possible origin for the chirality induced spin-selectivity (CISS) effect, and was used to explain and reproduce, with remarkable accuracy, experimental data from transport experiments showing the CISS effect. Here, we apply the spinterface mechanism to explain the appearance of magnetization at the interface between non-magnetic metals and chiral molecules, through the stabilization of other-wise fluctuating magnetic moments. We show that the stabilization of surface magnetic moments occurs for a wide range of realistic parameters and is robust against dephasing. Importantly, we show that the direction of the surface magnetic moments is determined by the chiral axis of the chiral molecules. Armed with the concept of stable surface magnetic moments, we then formulated a theory for the photoemission CISS effect. The theory, based on spin-dependent scattering, leads to direct predictions regarding the relation between the photoemission CISS effect, the chiral axis direction, the spinterface "size", and the tilt angle of the detector with respect to the surface. These predictions are within reach of current experimental capabilities, and may shed new light on the origin of the CISS effect.</description>

      <title>A quantum computing approach to fixed-node Monte Carlo using classical shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful approaches for solving electronic structure problems. Although they often provide high-accuracy solutions, the precision of most QMC methods is ultimately limited by a trial wave function that must be used. Recently, an approach has been demonstrated to allow the use of trial wave functions prepared on a quantum computer [Nature 603, 416 (2022)] in the auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC) method, using classical shadows to estimate the required overlaps. However, this approach has an exponential post-processing step to construct these overlaps, when performing classical shadows obtained using random Clifford circuits. Here, we study an approach to avoid this exponentially scaling step by using a fixed-node Monte Carlo method, based on full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC). This method is applied to the local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz. We consider H$_4$, ferrocene and benzene molecules using up to 12 qubits as examples. Circuits are compiled to native gates for typical near-term architectures, and we assess the impact of circuit-level depolarizing noise on the method. We also provide a comparison of AFQMC and fixed-node approaches, demonstrating that AFQMC is more robust to errors, although extrapolations of the fixed-node energy reduce this discrepancy. Although the method can be used to reach chemical accuracy, the sampling cost to achieve this is high even for small active spaces, suggesting caution for the prospect of outperforming conventional QMC approaches.</description>

      <title>Characterizing conical intersections of nucleobases on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical computing algorithms offer significant potential for accelerating the calculation of the electronic structure of strongly correlated molecules. In this work, we present the first quantum simulation of conical intersections (CIs) in a biomolecule, cytosine, using a superconducting quantum computer. We apply the Contracted Quantum Eigensolver (CQE) -- with comparisons to conventional Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) -- to compute the near-degenerate ground and excited states associated with the conical intersection, a key feature governing the photostability of DNA and RNA. The CQE is based on an exact ansatz for many-electron molecules in the absence of noise -- a critically important property for resolving strongly correlated states at CIs. Both methods demonstrate promising accuracy when compared with exact diagonalization, even on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, highlighting their potential for advancing the understanding of photochemical and photobiological processes. The ability to simulate these intersections is critical for advancing our knowledge of biological processes like DNA repair and mutation, with potential implications for molecular biology and medical research.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we analyze various Iterative Stockholder Analysis (ISA) methods for molecular density partitioning, focusing on the numerical performance of the recently proposed Linear approximation of Iterative Stockholder Analysis model (LISA) [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 164107 (2022)]. We first provide a systematic derivation of various iterative solvers to find the unique LISA solution. In a subsequent systematic numerical study, we evaluate their performance on 48 organic and inorganic, neutral and charged molecules and also compare LISA to two other well-known ISA variants: the Gaussian Iterative Stockholder Analysis (GISA) and Minimum Basis Iterative Stockholder analysis (MBIS). The study reveals that LISA-family methods can offer a numerically more efficient approach with better accuracy compared to the two comparative methods. Moreover, the well-known issue with the MBIS method, where atomic charges obtained for negatively charged molecules are anomalously negative, is not observed in LISA-family methods. Despite the fact that LISA occasionally exhibits elevated entropy as a consequence of the absence of more diffuse basis functions, this issue can be readily mitigated by incorporating additional or integrating supplementary basis functions within the LISA framework. This research provides the foundation for future studies on the efficiency and chemical accuracy of molecular density partitioning schemes.</description>

      <title>Force Fields for Deep Eutectic Mixtures: Application to Structure and 2D-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrizing energy functions for ionic systems can be challenging. Here, the total energy function for an eutectic system consisting of water, SCN$^-$, K$^+$ and acetamide is improved vis-a-vis experimentally measured properties. Given the importance of electrostatic interactions, two different types of models are considered: the first (model M0) uses atom-centered multipole whereas the other two (models M1 and M2) are based on fluctuating minimal distributed charges (fMDCM) that respond to geometrical changes of SCN$^-$. The Lennard-Jones parameters of the anion are adjusted to best reproduce experimentally known hydration free energies and densities which are matched to within a few percent for the final models irrespective of the electrostatic model. Molecular dynamics simulations of the eutectic mixtures with varying water content (between 0% and 100%) yield radial distribution functions and frequency correlation functions for the CN-stretch vibration. Comparison with experiments indicate that models based on fMDCM are considerably more consistent that those using multipoles. Computed viscosities from models M1 and M2 are within 30% of measured values and their change with increasing water content is consistent with experiments. This is not the case for model M0.</description>

      <title>Energy Relaxation of N$_2$O in Gaseous, Supercritical and Liquid Xenon and SF$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational and vibrational energy relaxation (RER and VER) of N$_2$O embedded in xenon and SF$_6$ environments ranging from the gas phase to the liquid, including the supercritical regime, is studied at a molecular level. Calibrated intermolecular interactions from high-level electronic structure calculations, validated against experiments for the pure solvents were used to carry out classical molecular dynamics simulations corresponding to experimental state points for near-critical isotherms. Computed RER rates in low-density solvent of $k_{\rm rot}^{\rm Xe} = (3.67\pm0.25)\cdot10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$M$^{-1}$ and $k_{\rm rot}^{\rm SF_6} = (1.25\pm0.12)\cdot10^{11}$ s$^{-1}$M$^{-1}$ compare well with rates determined by analysis of 2-dimensional infrared experiments. Simulations find that an isolated binary collision (IBC) description is successful up to solvent concentrations of $\sim 4$ M. For higher densities, including the supercritical regime, the simulations do not correctly describe RER, probably due to neglect of solvent-solute coupling in the analysis of the rotational motion. For VER, the near-quantitative agreement between simulations and pump-probe experiments captures the solvent density-dependent trends.</description>

      <title>Generalizable, Fast, and Accurate DeepQSPR with fastprop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02058v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Structure Property Relationship studies aim to define a mapping between molecular structure and arbitrary quantities of interest. This was historically accomplished via the development of descriptors which requires significant domain expertise and struggles to generalize. Thus the field has morphed into Molecular Property Prediction and been given over to learned representations which are highly generalizable. The paper introduces fastprop, a DeepQSPR framework which uses a cogent set of molecular level descriptors to meet and exceed the performance of learned representations on diverse datasets in dramatically less time. fastprop is freely available on github at github.com/JacksonBurns/fastprop.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create and analyze new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for any time step within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new and improved velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that, generally, only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations. One especially simple algorithm is highlighted, and the ability of one of the new on-site velocities to produce statistically correct averages for a particular damping value is specified.</description>

      <title>Electron recollisional excitation of OCS$^+$ in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron-photoion coincidence momentum imaging has been performed to investigate excitation processes on dissociative ionization of OCS, OCS $\to$ OCS$^+$ + e$^-$ $\to$ OC + S$^+$ + e$^-$, in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields. The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on coincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron momentum distribution shows clear asymmetry along the laser polarization direction with a 2$\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase difference between the $\omega$ and $2\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of electron emission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV where the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In the S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flips at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2 eV. In comparison with a classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulation, it has been clarified that this energy shift between the OCS$^+$ and S$^+$ channels corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and that electron recollisional excitation takes place to form the fragment ion in intense laser fields.</description>
