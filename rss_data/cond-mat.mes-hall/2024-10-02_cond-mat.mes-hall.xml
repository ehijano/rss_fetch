      <title>Control of spin-orbit torque-driven domain nucleation through geometry in chirally coupled magnetic tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) can be exploited in magnetic thin films to realize lateral chirally coupled systems, providing a way to couple different sections of a magnetic racetrack and realize interconnected networks of magnetic logic gates. Here, we systematically investigate the interplay between spin-orbit torques, chiral coupling and the device design in domain wall racetracks. We show that the current-induced domain nucleation process can be tuned between single-domain nucleation and repeated nucleation of alternate domains by changing the orientation of an in-plane patterned magnetic region within an out-of-plane magnetic racetrack. Furthermore, by combining experiments and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the combination of damping-like and field-like spin-orbit torques with DMI results in selective domain wall injection in one of two arms of a Y-shaped devices depending on the current density. Such an element constitutes the basis of domain wall based demultiplexer, which is essential for distributing a single input to any one of the multiple outputs in logic circuits. Our results provide input for the design of reliable and multifunctional domain-wall circuits based on chirally coupled interfaces.</description>

      <title>Radiofrequency receiver based on isotropic solid-state spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been proposed as robust radiofrequency (RF)-optical transducers sensitive to a specific RF frequency tuned by an external static magnetic field, but often require precise field alignment with the system's symmetry axis. Here we introduce an isotropic solid-state spin system, namely weakly coupled spin pairs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which acts as an RF-optical transducer independent of the direction of the tuning magnetic field, allowing greatly simplified experimental design. Using this platform, we first demonstrate a single-frequency RF receiver with frequency tunability from 0.1 to 19 GHz. We next demonstrate an instantaneous wideband RF spectrum analyser by applying a magnetic field gradient to encode RF frequency into spatial position. Finally, we utilise the spectrum analyser to detect free-space-transmitted RF signals matching the strength and frequency of typical Wi-Fi signals. This work exemplifies the unique capabilities of isotropic spins in hBN to operate as RF sensors, while circumventing the challenging requirement of precisely aligned magnetic fields facing conventional solid-state spins.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonlinear Hall Effect Induced by Electric Field and Temperature Gradient in 3D Chiral Magnetic Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the current proportional to the cross product of an electric field and a temperature gradient, which we call the Nonlinear Chiral Thermo-Electric (NCTE) Hall effect, in 3D chiral magnetic structures. We analyze both discrete and continuous magnetization cases. From the analysis of discrete magnetization, we clarify the conditions for the emergence of the NCTE Hall effect caused by magnetic textures. In the continuous magnetization case, we show that the NCTE Hall conductivity is proportional to the density of magnetic monopoles. This study discovers unconventional phenomena unique to 3D magnetic textures, and has significant implications for spintronics and quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Edge and bulk states in a three-site Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chain of quantum dots (QDs) coupled via semiconductor-superconductor hybrid regions can form an artificial Kitaev chain hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs). These zero-energy states are expected to be localised on the edges of the chain, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunneling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments, and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain.</description>

      <title>High Mobility SiGe/Ge 2DHG Heterostructure Quantum Wells for Semiconductor Hole Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong spin-orbit coupling and relatively weak hyperfine interactions make germanium hole spin qubits a promising candidate for semiconductor quantum processors. The two-dimensional hole gas structure of strained Ge quantum wells serves as the primary material platform for spin hole qubits.A low disorder material environment is essential for this process. In this work, we fabricated a Ge/SiGe heterojunction with a 60 nm buried quantum well layer on a Si substrate using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition technology. At a temperature of 16 mK, when the carrier density is 1.87*10^11/cm2, we obtained a mobility as high as 308.64*10^4cm2/Vs. Concurrently, double quantum dot and planar germanium coupling with microwave cavities were also successfully achieved.This fully demonstrates that this structure can be used for the preparation of higher-performance hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Rydberg excitons and polaritons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for excitons and exciton polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers under a perpendicular static magnetic field. We obtain numerically exact solutions for the ground and excited states, accounting for the interplay between arbitrarily large magnetic fields and light-matter coupling strengths. This includes the very strong coupling regime, where light-induced modifications of the exciton wavefunction become essential and the approximate coupled oscillator description breaks down. Our results show excellent agreement with recent experimental measurements of the diamagnetic shift of the ground and excited exciton states in WS$_2$, MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$ monolayers. For polaritons, we consider experimentally relevant system parameters and demonstrate that the diamagnetic shifts of both the ground and excited states at high magnetic fields exhibit clear signatures of the very strong coupling regime, highlighting the necessity of our microscopic and numerically exact treatment over perturbative approaches. Furthermore, our microscopic approach allows us to evaluate the exciton-exciton and polariton-polariton interaction strengths. Comparing results specific to TMD monolayers with those applicable to quantum wells, we find that variational approaches overestimate the TMD excitons' interaction strength. We also observe that magnetic fields weaken the interaction strength for both excitons and polaritons, with a less pronounced effect in TMDs than in quantum wells, and that light-induced modifications to the matter component in TMD polaritons can enhance interaction strengths beyond those of purely excitonic interactions.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement in a Josephson Junction Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement in a model Josephson photonics system in which a dc voltage-biased Josephson junction couples a collection of cavity modes and populates them with microwave photons. Using an approximate quadratic Hamiltonian model, we study the Gaussian entanglement that develops between the modes as the Josephson energy of the system is increased. We find that the modes in the system fall into a series of blocks, with bipartite entanglement generated between modes within a given block. Tripartite entanglement between modes within a given block is also widespread, though it is limited to certain ranges of the Josephson energy. The system could provide an alternative route to generating multimode microwave entanglement, an important resource in quantum technologies, without the need for ac excitation.</description>

      <title>Topological orbital Hall effect caused by skyrmions and antiferromagnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a pure topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Cooling and Squeezing a Microwave Cavity State with Magnons Using a Beam Splitter Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two geometries to realize a significant beam splitter interaction (XZ coupling) between magnons and a 2D microwave cavity mode. In both setups the cavity is analogous to the mechanical oscillator in a conventional optomechanical setup. The backaction effects are calculated with realistic experimental parameters. The analytical results show that we can not only make the backaction damping (anti-damping) rate larger than the bare microwave resonator damping rate, but that we can also achieve quantum squeezing of the resonator where the uncertainty in one quadruture (charge or current) is smaller than its zero point fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Element-specific, non-destructive profiling of layered heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00241v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures is now so precise that metrology has become a key challenge for progress in science and applications. It is now relatively straightforward to characterize classic III-V and group IV heterostructures consisting of slabs of different semiconductor alloys with thicknesses of $\sim$5 nm and greater using sophisticated tools such as X-ray diffraction, high energy X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. However, profiling thin layers with nm or sub-nm thickness, e.g. atomically thin dopant layers ($\delta$-layers), of impurities required for modulation doping and spin-based quantum and classical information technologies is more challenging.
  Here, we present theory and experiment showing how resonant-contrast X-ray reflectometry meets this challenge. The technique takes advantage of the change in the scattering factor of atoms as their core level resonances are scanned by varying the X-ray energy. We demonstrate the capability of the resulting element-selective, non-destructive profilometry for single arsenic $\delta$-layers within silicon, and show that the sub-nm electronic thickness of the $\delta$-layers corresponds to sub-nm chemical thickness. In combination with X-ray fluorescence imaging, this enables non-destructive three-dimensional characterization of nano-structured quantum devices. Due to the strong resonances at soft X-ray wavelengths, the technique is also ideally suited to characterize layered quantum materials, such as cuprates or the topical infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Optically-Controlled Nano-Transducers Based on Cleaved Superlattices for Monitoring Gigahertz Surface Acoustic Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) convey energy at subwavelength depths along surfaces. Using interdigital transducers (IDTs) and opto-acousto-optic transducers (OAOTs), researchers have harnessed coherent SAWs with nanosecond periods and micrometer localization depth for various applications. However, the utilization of cutting-edge OAOTs produced through surface nanopatterning techniques has set the upper limit for coherent SAW frequencies below 100 GHz, constrained by factors such as the quality and pitch of the surface nanopattern, not to mention the electronic bandwidth limitations of the IDTs. In this context, unconventional optically-controlled nano-transducers based on cleaved superlattices (SLs) are here presented as an alternative solution. To demonstrate their viability, we conducted proof-of-concept experiments using ultrafast lasers in a pump-probe configuration on SLs made of alternating AlxGa1-xAs and AlyGa1-yAs layers with approximately 70 nm periodicity and cleaved along their growth direction to produce a periodic nanostructured surface. The acoustic vibrations, generated and detected by laser beams incident on the cleaved surface, span a range from 40 GHz to 70 GHz, corresponding to the generalized surface Rayleigh mode and bulk modes within the dispersion relation. This exploration shows that, in addition to SAWs, cleaved SLs offer the potential to observe surface-skimming longitudinal and transverse acoustic waves at GHz frequencies. This proof-of-concept demonstration below 100 GHz in nanoacoustics using such an unconventional platform offers opportunities for realizing sub-THz to THz coherent surface acoustic vibrations in the future, as SLs can be epitaxially grown with atomic-scale layer width and quality.</description>

      <title>The implications of collisions on the spatial profile of electric potential and the space-charge limited current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-charge limited current (SCLC) in a vacuum diode is given by the Child-Langmuir law (CLL), whose electric potential $\varphi(x) = (\it{x/D})^{4/3}$, where x is the spatial coordinate across the gap and D is the gap separation distance. For a collisional diode, SCLC is given by the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) and $\varphi(x) = (x/D)^{3/2}$. This Letter applies a capacitance argument for SCLC and uses the transit time from a recent exact solution for collisional SCLC to show that $\varphi(x) = (x/D)^{\xi}$ for a general collisional gap, where $4/3 \leqslant \xi \leqslant 3/2$. Furthermore, $\xi$ is strictly a function of $\nu T$, where $\nu$ is the collision frequency and T is the electron transit time. Using this definition of $\xi$, we estimate the spatial dependence of the electron velocity and use the capacitance to derive an analytic equation for collisional SCLC that agrees within $\sim5-6\%$ of the exact solution that requires solving parametrically through T. We derive equations in the limits of $\nu \longrightarrow 0$ and $\nu\longrightarrow \infty$ for general $\xi$ that asymptotically recover the CLL as $\nu \longrightarrow 0$ and the MGL as $\nu \longrightarrow \infty$. Matching these limits shows that $\xi \simeq 1.40$ and $V \propto D^2\nu^2$ at the transition from a vacuum to collisional diode for any device condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive theoretical model for the interaction strength between a pair of exciton-polaritons in microcavity devices. Ab initio numerical calculations for dipolar polaritons in one dimension are used as a starting point to build a Born-Oppenheimer theory that generally applies to generic -- dipolar or non-dipolar polaritons -- in both one and two dimensions. This theory anticipates that the strong coupling to the cavity mode leads to a drastic enhancement of the polariton interactions as compared to bare excitons, and predicts unexpected scaling laws in the interaction strength as a function of system parameters. Comparisons with available experimental data are drawn, and specific suggestions to validate it with new experiments are made. Promising strategies towards the observation of a strong polariton blockade regime are finally sketched.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices are a new type of synthetic quantum matter emulated in circuit quantum electrodynamics and electric-circuit networks, where particles coherently hop on a discrete tessellation of two-dimensional negatively curved space. While real-space methods and a reciprocal-space hyperbolic band theory have been recently proposed to analyze the energy spectra of those systems, discrepancies between the two sets of approaches remain. In this work, we reconcile those approaches by first establishing an equivalence between hyperbolic band theory and $U(N)$ topological Yang-Mills theory on higher-genus Riemann surfaces. We then show that moments of the density of states of hyperbolic tight-binding models correspond to expectation values of Wilson loops in the quantum gauge theory and become exact in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Kondo-Majorana interplay in ac response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze dynamical transport properties of a hybrid nanostructure, comprising a correlated quantum dot embedded between the source and drain electrodes, which are subject to an ac voltage, focusing on signatures imprinted on the charge transport by the side-attached Majorana zero-energy mode. The considerations are based on the Kubo formula, for which the relevant correlation functions are determined by using the numerical renormalization group approach, which allows us to consider the correlation effects due to the Coulomb repulsion and their interplay with the Majorana mode in a non-perturbative manner. We point out universal features of the dynamical conductance, showing up in the Kondo-Majorana regime, and differentiate them against the conventional Kondo and Majorana systems. In particular, we predict that the Majorana quasiparticles give rise to universal fractional values of the ac conductance in the well-defined frequency range below the peak at the Kondo scale. We also show this Kondo scale to actually increase with strengthening the coupling to the topological superconducting wire.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Conductivity in a Graphene/Haldane and Haldane/Haldane Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital Hall conductivity in bilayer graphene (G/G) by modifying one or both the layers as Haldane type ($\rm G/ \tilde G$ : Graphene/Haldane and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ : Haldane/Haldane) with the inclusion of next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping strength ($t_2$) and flux ($\phi$). It is observed that the low energy bands of $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ are isolated with a gap at charge neutrality with the next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping term $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$. The time reversal (\textit{TR}) symmetry breaking with $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$ induces a large orbital magnetic moment ($\vb{m}_n(\vb{k})$) for the $n^{th}$ band in $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ bilayers. This \textit{TR} symmetry breaking, modulated by the $t_2$ strength, leads to the emergence of {\it Orbital Ferromagnetism} and {\it Valley Orbital Magnetism} within the BZ for the Haldane single layer as well for both $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$. We show that for the applied longitudinal electric fields, the intrinsic angular momentum ($L^z$) gives the orbital current ($\mathcal{J}^{z,orb}$) along a transverse direction and generates the orbital Hall conductivity (OHC). We further show that the orbital magnetic polarity leads the Haldane single layer to {\it Orbital Chern Insulator} with the quantized OHC in the gap over the occupied bands. Moreover, the accumulation of orbital magnetic moment of the bands in Haldane graphene bilayer shows {\it Quantum Orbital Hall Insulator} and {\it Orbital Chern Insulators}. Similarly, we show that in the hetero-bilayers, one of the layers of the Haldane type generates the orbital magnetism and induces the OHC. We conclude that the isolated bands in Haldane graphene bilayers with external stimuli are of an orbital nature and have various quantum orbital Hall phases.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Topological Flatband Excitons in Semiconductor Moir\'e Heterostructures: a Bosonic Kane-Mele Model Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a highly versatile and fruitful platform for exploring correlated topological electronic phases. One of the most remarkable examples is the recently discovered fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) under zero magnetic field. Here we propose a minimal structure that hosts long-lived excitons -- a ubiquitous bosonic excitation in TMD semiconductors -- with narrow topological bosonic bands. The nontrivial exciton topology originates from hybridization of moir\'e interlayer excitons, and is tunable by controlling twist angle and electric field. At small twist angle, the lowest exciton bands are isolated from higher energy bands and provide a solid-state realization of the bosonic Kane-Mele model with topological flatbands, which could potentially support the bosonic version of FQAHE.</description>

      <title>Decoherence in electron transport: back-scattering, effect on interference and rectification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence is an undesirable, but ubiquitous phenomenon in quantum systems. Here, we study the effect of partial decoherence, induced via a B\"uttiker probe, on two-terminal electronic transport across one-dimensional quantum wires and rings, in both the linear and non-linear regimes. We find that dephasing causes backscattering when introduced locally in a ballistic channel. Further, we find that decoherence results in rectification when inversion is broken in the two-terminal transport set-up by a combination of a local dephasing centre and a static impurity. Interestingly, the rectification strength and even its direction varies strongly with the relative distance between the probe and the scatterer. We further analyze how decoherence affects characteristic quantum effects in electronic transport, such as, Fabry-P\'erot oscillations in double-barrier setups, and Aharonov-Bohm interference in one-dimensional rings, and find that the amplitude of oscillations in conductance is reduced by decoherence.</description>

      <title>Polariton assisted incoherent to coherent excitation energy transfer between colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of energy transfer between two nanocrystal quantum dots placed within an optical microcavity. By adjusting the coupling strength between the cavity photon mode and the quantum dots, we have the capacity to fine-tune the effective coupling between the donor and acceptor. Introducing a nonadiabatic parameter, $\gamma$, governed by the coupling to the cavity mode, we demonstrate the system's capability to shift from the overdamped Forster regime ($\gamma \ll 1$) to an underdamped coherent regime ($\gamma \gg 1$). In the latter regime, characterized by swift energy transfer rates, the dynamics are influenced by decoherence times. To illustrate this, we study the exciton energy transfer dynamics between two closely positioned CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots with sizes and separations relevant to experimental conditions. Employing an atomistic approach, we calculate the excitonic level arrangement, exciton-phonon interactions, and transition dipole moments of the quantum dots within the microcavity. These parameters are then utilized to define a model Hamiltonian. Subsequently, we apply a generalized non-Markovian quantum Redfield equation to delineate the dynamics within the polaritonic framework.</description>

      <title>Orbital Edelstein effect from the gradient of a scalar potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of the electronic wavefunctions. These properties are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. While Berry curvature-mediated transport effects such as the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and provide new strategies to design functionalities based on the quantum geometry.</description>

Abstract: While the promise of clean and defect-free $\textrm{MoS}_{2}$ nanotubes as quantum electronic devices is obvious, ranging from strong spin-orbit interaction to intrinsic superconductivity, device fabrication still poses considerable challenges. Deterministic transfer of transition metal dichalcogenide nanomaterials and transparent contacts to the nanomaterials are nowadays highly active topics of research, both with fundamental research and applications in mind. Contamination from transport agents as well as surface adsorbates and surface charges play a critical role for device performance. Many techniques have been proposed to address these topics for transition metal dichalcogenides in general. Here, we analyse their usage for the transfer based fabrication of $\textrm{MoS}_{2}$ nanotube devices. Further, we compare different contact materials in order to avoid the formation of a Schottky barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrumentation developments in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) one decade ago paved the way for combining milli-electronvolt energy resolution in spectroscopy with \r{A}ngstr\"om-sized electron probes, unlocking unexplored realms for solid state physics at the nanometer-scale. The fundamental understanding of the scattering processes involved has made it possible to separate atomically localized signals, providing insights into vibrations at the atomic scale. In this Letter, we outline the experimental, conceptual and theoretical advances in this field and also make comparisons with tip-based optical techniques before discussing future perspectives of this exciting technique. Optimization of dark-field signal collection will play a fundamental role in making this technique more widely applicable to a range of materials problems. The benefits of adding momentum-resolution will also be discussed and a powerful acquisition scheme proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal and spatial scales of resistance fluctuations ($R$-fluctuations) at the superconducting resistive transition accessed through voltage fluctuations measurements in thin epitaxial TiN films. This material is characterized by a slow electron-phonon relaxation, which puts it far beyond the applicability range of the textbook scenario of superconducting fluctuations. The measured Lorentzian spectrum of the $R$-fluctuations identifies their correlation time, which is nearly constant across the transition region and has no relation to the conventional Ginzburg-Landau time scale. Instead, the correlation time coincides with the energy relaxation time determined by a combination of the electron-phonon relaxation and the relaxation via diffusion into reservoirs. Our data is quantitatively consistent with the model of spontaneous temperature fluctuations and highlight the lack of understanding of the resistive transition in materials with slow electron-phonon relaxation.</description>

      <title>Central role of filler-polymer interplay in nonlinear reinforcement of elastomeric nanocomposites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticles can greatly enhance the mechanical response of elastomeric polymers essential to a wide range of applications, yet their precise molecular mechanisms of high-strain reinforcement remain largely unresolved. Here we show, based on molecular dynamics simulations, that high-strain reinforcement emerges from an interplay between granular nanoparticulate compressive behavior in the normal direction and polymer incompressibility. This feedback loop, which is initiated by a mismatch in the Poisson ratios of nanofiller and polymer, invokes a contribution from the polymer's bulk modulus to the elongational stress, while the tendency of the polymer to contract in the normal direction maintains a near-jammed filler state. This effect persists even once the direct filler elongational contribution becomes dissipative after the 'Payne effect' yield. These results indicate that direct particle-particle contact effects, even in the absence of potential augmenting mechanisms such as glassy polymer bridges, can drive the mechanical reinforcement effects typical of experimental systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model fully contacted by two BCS superconductors, such that all modes of the dot contribute to the coupling, which encodes hopping and spin-flip processes. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting gap. At finite temperature, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the interaction self-energy and the tunneling matrix for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable another class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable alternative approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>

Abstract: The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D atomic monolayer of gold, has opened new avenues in exploring novel materials. However, the question of when multilayer Goldene transitions into bulk gold remains unresolved. This study used density functional theory calculations to address this fundamental question. Our findings reveal that multilayer Goldene retains an AA-like stacking configuration of up to six layers, with no observation of Bernal-like stacking as seen in graphene. Goldene spontaneously transitions to a bulk-like gold structure at seven layers, adopting a rhombohedral (ABC-like) stacking characteristic of bulk face-centered cubic (FCC) gold. The atomic arrangement converges entirely to the bulk gold lattice for more than ten layers. Quantum confinement significantly impacts the electronic properties, with monolayer and bulk Goldene exhibiting a single Dirac cone at the X-point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast, multilayer Goldene shows two Dirac cones at the X- and Y-points. Additionally, monolayer Goldene exhibits anisotropic optical absorption, which is absent in bulk gold. This study provides a deeper understanding of multilayer Goldene's structural and electronic properties and stacked 2D materials in general.</description>
