      <title>Emergent collective heat engines from neighborhood-dependent thermal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05715v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05793v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems. Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates, yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral approaches to complex systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Compartment Model of Epidemic Spreading in Complex Networks with Mortality and Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic compartment model, which includes mortality caused by the disease, but excludes demographic birth and death processes. Individuals are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states (compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R (recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions. We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number ${\cal R}_0 &gt; 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting) and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of the pendulum revisited from Husimi's adiabaticity parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the irreversibility of the pendulum with time-dependent angular frequency, considered in a classical paper by K. Husimi. He introduced a parameter that measures the adiabaticity of a process utilizing an adiabatic invariant for the equation of motion of the pendulum. With this adiabaticity parameter, Husimi showed the irreversibility of the pendulum for a cyclic process, which is reminiscent of the Planck principle in thermodynamics, based on the microscopic mechanics. In this study, we generalize the argument by Husimi to a damped pendulum with friction, and highlight the role of conservation of a phase-space area on the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter. Moreover, we also investigate the second law of thermodynamics and its generalization for a general non-cyclic process as well as a cyclic process, and elucidate how the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter impacts on this law. In particular, for a general non-cyclic process, we show the law of entropy non-decrease for the pendulum without friction by using the property of the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter.</description>

      <title>The Thermodynamic Limit of Extreme First-Passage Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fr\'echet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fr\'echet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.</description>

      <title>Duality between dissipation-coherence trade-off and thermodynamic speed limit based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation for stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two fundamental trade-offs for general stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit. The first is the dissipation-coherence trade-off, which was numerically conjectured and partially proved by Santolin and Falasco [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 057101 (2025)]. This trade-off bounds the entropy production required for one oscillatory period using the number of oscillations that occur before steady-state correlations are disrupted. The second is the thermodynamic speed limit, which bounds the entropy production with the Euclidean length of the limit cycle. These trade-offs are obtained by substituting mutually dual observables, derived from the stability of the limit cycle, into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. This fact allows us to regard the dissipation-coherence trade-off as the dual of the thermodynamic speed limit. We numerically demonstrate these trade-offs using the noisy R\"{o}ssler model.</description>

      <title>Dynamically emergent correlations in Brownian particles subject to simultaneous non-Poissonian resetting protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional gas of $N$ independent Brownian particles subject to simultaneous stochastic resetting, with inter-reset times drawn from a general waiting-time distribution $\psi(\tau)$. This includes the well-known Poissonian case, where $\psi(\tau)=re^{-r\tau}$, and extends to more general classes of resetting, such as heavy-tailed and bounded distributions. We show that the simultaneous resetting generates correlations between particles dynamically. These correlations grow with time and eventually drive the system into a strongly correlated non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Exploiting the renewal structure of the resetting dynamics, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in the NESS. We show that the NESS has a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that enables us to compute various physical observables exactly for arbitrary $\psi(\tau)$. These observables include the average density, extreme value and order statistics, the spacing distribution between consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a given interval centered at the origin. We discuss the universal features of the large $N$ scaling behaviors of these observables for different choices of the resetting protocol $\psi(\tau)$. Our results provide an interesting example of a stochastic control whereby, by tuning the inter-reset distribution $\psi(\tau)$, one can generate a class of tunable, and yet solvable, strongly correlated NESS in a many-body system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence in a Quantum Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.01662v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify that quantum coherence is a valuable resource in the quantum heat engine, which is designed in a quantum thermodynamic cycle assisted by a quantum Maxwell's demon. This demon is in a superposed state. The quantum work and heat are redefined as the sum of coherent and incoherent parts in the energy representation. The total quantum work and the corresponding efficiency of the heat engine can be enhanced due to the coherence consumption of the demon. In addition, we discuss an universal information heat engine driven by quantum coherence. The extractable work of this heat engine is limited by the quantum coherence, even if it has no classical thermodynamic cost. This resource-driven viewpoint provides a direct and effective way to clarify the thermodynamic processes where the coherent superposition of states cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>A topological approach to the Cahn-Hilliard equation and hyperuniform fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are disordered, correlated systems in which density fluctuations are suppressed at large scales. Such a property generalizes the concept of order in patterns and is relevant across diverse physical systems. We present a numerical characterization of hyperuniform scalar fields that leverages persistent homology. Topological features across different lengths are represented in persistence diagrams, while similarities or differences between patterns are quantified through Wasserstein distances between these diagrams. We apply this framework to numerical solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a canonical model for generating hyperuniform scalar fields. We validate the approach against known features of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, including its scaling properties, convergence to the sharp interface limit, and self-similarity of the solutions. We then generalize the approach by studying Gaussian random fields exhibiting different degrees and classes of hyperuniformity, showing how the proposed approach can be exploited to reconstruct global properties from local topological information. Overall, we show how hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological features in disordered correlated fields. We expect this analysis to be applicable to a wide range of scalar fields, particularly those involving interfaces and free boundaries.</description>

      <title>How hydrodynamic interactions alter polymer stretching in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between segments of a polymer have long been known to strongly affect polymer stretching in laminar viscometric flows. Yet the role of HI in fluctuating turbulent flows remains unclear. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we examine the stretching dynamics of bead-spring chains with inter-bead HI, as they are transported in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow (within the ultra-dilute, one-way coupling regime). We find that HI-endowed chains exhibit a steeper coil-stretch transition as the elastic relaxation time is increased, i.e., HI cause less stretching of stiff polymers and more stretching of moderately to highly elastic polymers. The probability distribution function of the end-to-end extension is also modified, with HI significantly limiting the range of extensions over which a power-law range appears. On quantifying the repeated stretching and recoiling of chains by computing persistence time distributions, we find that HI delays migration between stretched and coiled states. These effects of HI, which are consistent with chains experiencing an effective conformation-dependent drag, are sensitive to the level of coarse-graining in the bead-spring model. Specifically, an HI-endowed dumbbell, which cannot form a physical coil, is unable to experience the hydrodynamic shielding effect of HI. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating an extension-dependent drag force in dumbbell-based simulations of turbulent polymer solutions. To develop and test such an augmented dumbbell model, we propose the use of a time-correlated Gaussian random flow, in which the turbulent stretching statistics are shown to be well-approximated.</description>

      <title>Interacting many-body non-Hermitian systems as Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rich phenomenology emerges at the intersection of non-Hermiticity and many-body dynamics, yet physically realizable implementations remain challenging. In this work, we propose a general formalism that maps non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonians to the Laplacians of Markov chains, such that wavefunction amplitudes are re-interpreted as stochastic many-body configuration probabilities. Despite explicitly preserving all state transition processes and inheriting analogous non-Hermitian localization and state-space fragmentation, our Markov chain processes exhibit distinct steady-state behavior independently of energetic considerations that govern quantum evolution. We demonstrate our framework with two contrasting representative scenarios, one involving asymmetric (biased) propagation with exclusion interactions, and the other involving flipping pairs of adjacent spins (agents). These results reveal robust and distinctive signatures of non-Hermitian phenomena in classical stochastic settings such as ecological and social networks, and provide a versatile framework for studying non-reciprocal many-body dynamics across and beyond physics.</description>

      <title>Stockmayer Fluid with a Shifted Dipole: Interfacial Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the liquid-vapor interface in the shifted Stockmayer fluid using molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble. We study the role of the dipole moment strength and the degree of asymmmetry on equilibrium interfacial characteristics, including density profiles, polar order, nematic order, interfacial polarization, electric field, and electrostatic potential. In addition, we compute angular distribution functions across the interface to gain insight into how the dipole shift affects the molecular orientation. We find that the shift significantly effects angular distribution functions by altering the polar order while leaving the nematic order relatively unaffected, in comparison to the reference symmetric Stockmayer fluid. We find that these results are consistently explained using an image-dipole construction that has been previously applied to symmetric Stockmayer fluids but has never been extended to the shifted model. We find remarkable agreement between the simple theory and the simulations in the qualitative shape of the distribution functions for both the liquid and vapor phases in proximity to the interface. Unexpectedly, the spontaneous polarization at the interface, and therefore the generated electric field, changes sign as the dipole moment strength increases. This also leads to an inversion of the sign of the potential difference across the interface.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</description>

      <title>Modified Quantum Wheatstone Bridge based on current circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a simple fermionic system designed to detect an unknown hopping rate between two sites by analyzing current circulation. The system exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength. We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance. Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Our results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Bayesian field theory for the rate estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the statistical inference of a time-dependent rate of events in the framework of Bayesian field theory. By mapping the problem to a stochastic partial differential equation, as it is standard approach in field theory, we are able to numerically sample the distribution around the maximum likelihood path. We then analytically consider the perturbative expansion around the local and linear solution, and at the leading-order correction to the variance we find novel terms which depend on the local shape of the maximum likelihood path. We show that this shape correction is statistically most important in the variance expansion than the nonlinearity corrections. We then demonstrate the general applicability of the simulation method by extending it to the case of uncertain event times and by estimating the mortality rate in Venice during the 1348 Black Death epidemics from indirect evidence.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fluctuation Driven Structural Relaxation in Undeformed Glasses: Unraveling the Evolution of Mechanical Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glasses are mechanically rigid, still undergo structural relaxation which changes their properties and affects potential technological applications. Understanding the underlying physical processes is a problem of broad theoretical and practical interest. We investigate intermittent structural relaxation events or ``avalanches'' occurring inside glassy regime. Contrary to the more well-known avalanches due to shear, here they are induced by thermal fluctuations in undeformed glass. By analyzing changes in structural, mechanical, dynamical, topological and vibrational properties of the system, we provide a multi-faceted characterization of avalanches. Overall we find that the system softens due to avalanches. Further, we develop a formalism to extract local measures of non-Affine displacement and tensorial strain for thermal amorphous solids in absence of any external deformation. Our analysis highlights a key difference between two types of driving: while the shear deformation response is dominated by volume preserving deviatoric strain, changes in local density must be considered to model response of undeformed glass under thermal noise. The observations suggest the idea of Generalized Strain Transformation Zones (GSTZ), where coupled shear and volume-changing deformations govern thermally-mediated plasticity. Our work paves the way for a unified description of elasto-plastic response of (athermal) mechanically deformed and thermally driven undeformed glasses.</description>

      <title>Driven dynamics of localization phase transition in the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with initial gapless extended states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the driven dynamics of localization phase transitions have garnered growing interest. However, studies so far have mainly considered initial localized states, whose driven dynamics follow the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization phase transition in the Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model starting from a gapless extended state, which violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of KZM. By linearly driving the quasiperiodic potential strength across the critical point, we numerically simulate the driven dynamics and analyze the scaling behavior of both the inverse participation ratio ($\mathcal{I}$) and the dynamic deviation from the instantaneous ground state energy $(\mathcal{D})$. We demonstrate that the driven dynamics starting from initially extended states satisfies the criterion for the applicability of KZM and its extension, finite-time scaling (FTS). The scaling functions governing the driven dynamics of both $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ have been derived based on FTS and numerically validated. We found that the scaling functions exhibit significant differences at large $R$ and small $R$, and also differ considerably from the scaling functions when the initial state is localized, highlighting the crucial role of initial state behavior. The established scaling laws remain robust across a wide range of system sizes and driving rates, providing testable predictions for experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Thermalization dynamics of finite-size quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using holographic duality, we investigate thermalization process when two finite-size quantum critical systems are brought into thermal contact along a perfectly transmitting interface. Through real-time simulations of gravitational dynamics, which are spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic and are confined within two dynamical bulk branes, we identify three distinct thermalization patterns governed by the energy imbalance (temperature difference) and system size. For systems with large size and small energy imbalance, we observe recurrent cycles of formation and collapse of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). Under large energy imbalance, shock waves persist for a prolonged period with sustained boundary reflections, while rarefaction waves rapidly homogenize. When the system size is sufficiently small, dissipation dominates and leads to oscillatory decay without sustained NESS or shock structure. In sharp contrast to diffusive systems, we uncover that wave-propagated energy transfer together with boundary reflections enables nearly complete energy swapping between subsystems during thermalization. Our results reveal rich thermalization dynamics in finite-size quantum critical systems across spatial scales and energy gradient regimes.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Chain Exchange in Diblock Copolymer Micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanism of chain exchange in diblock copolymer micelles using two distinct yet complementary simulation techniques. First, enhanced sampling method is combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics to compute a two-dimensional free energy surface for the chain expulsion process in the strong segregation regime. To facilitate chain expulsion, a distance-based collective variable is biased, and the end-to-end distance of the core block is also biased to ensure sufficient sampling of chain conformations. The free energy surface reveals a bimodal distribution of chain conformations along the effective reaction coordinate. The minimum free energy pathway qualitatively aligns with the Halperin-Alexander budding-like mechanism. The free energy barrier along this pathway is calculated for core block lengths ranging from $N_\textrm{core}=4$-$100$, and the barrier is shown to scale as $\beta\Delta F_\textrm{barr} \sim N_\textrm{core}^{2/3}$, consistent with the Halperin-Alexander prediction for a globular transition state. Notably, the free energy surface also reveals a nearly degenerate alternative pathway in which the chain escapes by extending out bead-by-bead, in agreement with previous simulations. We also study the case of a dense copolymer melt, where the core-block shrinks but does not collapse into a dry compact globule in the opposite phase. To examine the kinetic pathway, a simplified model is introduced in which a single chain escapes from a planar interface within a mean-field background. Forward flux sampling calculations yield a linear scaling of the barrier, $\beta\Delta F_\textrm{barr} \sim N_\textrm{core}$, in agreement with experimental observations and prior simulations. Moreover, analysis of successful escape trajectories highlights an extended chain conformation at the transition state.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Group Decision Making and Beyond 2. Distorted Polarization and Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends previous work on echo chambers modeled by an Ising-like system at zero temperature (1. Echo Chambers and random Polarization, Symmetry 2024, 16(12), 1566). There, polarization emerged as a spontaneous symmetry-breaking process with a randomly selected direction. Here using a mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations I show that this mechanism is highly vulnerable to minimal distortions. An external symmetry-breaking field, even vanishingly small, suffices to impose a global direction and suppress opposite domains, producing distorted full polarization. In contrast, a handful of quenched local fields with zero average do not erase polarization but reorganize it into opposing domains. Remarkably, as few as two opposed fields, if placed at tipping sites, can redirect the entire system. These fragile sites, indistinguishable from others, act as hidden tipping points that amplify microscopic biases into macroscopic outcomes. Difference in local field proportions is found to be instrumental to guarantee a winning majority. The results highlight how minimal, strategically placed interventions can override autonomous self-organization. The results could, if applicable on social media platforms, question their presumed democratic nature of consensus.</description>

      <title>Transitional patterns on a spherical surface: from scars to domain defects of mixed lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The system of mixed hexagonal and square lattices on a spherical surface is examined, with an emphasis on the exploration of the disclination patterns that form in the square-rich regime. To demonstrate the possible outcomes, the Hertzian potential energy is used as a model for pairwise molecular interactions, which is known to support coexistent hexagonal and square lattices. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we show that at least four different disclination morphologies arise in a square-rich background: triangular defect domains composed of hexagonal lattices arranged in a cubic formation, bridged cubic state, linear scar disclinations with no hexagon content, and open scar disclinations containing a significant amount of hexagonal lattice in the open regions. Order parameters are also introduced to highlight the significance of the bridged and open-scar disclinations, both being the new morphologies reported in this study. The fact that the bridged state is an energetically preferred one is further demonstrated by a separate elastic energy model, which confirms its prevalence over the unbridged cubic state.</description>

Abstract: We study open boundary conditions for the $D^{(2)}_3$ spin chain, which shares connections with the six-vertex model, under staggering, and also to the antiferromagnetic Potts model. By formulating a suitable transfer matrix that is related to $K$ matrices and to the Jimbo $R$-matrix, we obtain an analytical expression for the Hamiltonian, as a logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix, under open boundary conditions. Such computations have connections with several objects studied in Integrable Probability, which underlie exactly solvable structures.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Carath\'{e}odory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic storage models based on essentially non-Gaussian noise are considered. The stochastic description of physical systems based on stochastic storage models is associated with generalized Poisson (or shot) noise, in which the jump values can be quite large. Stochastic storage models have a direct physical meaning: some elements enter the system and leave it. Storage processes fit into the general scheme of dynamic systems subject to the additive influence of a random process. The main relationships of storage models are described, and the possibilities of applying the mathematical provisions of stochastic storage processes to various physical problems are indicated. A number of examples of applying the stochastic storage model are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that is inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Landscape of Non-Equilibrium Memories with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at https://memorynca.github.io/2D.</description>

Abstract: We show that, after suitably adjusting a uniform transverse magnetic field, the generic inhomogeneous open XX spin chain has a two-fold degeneracy, and an exact $su(2)$ symmetry whose "inhomogeneous" nonlocal generators depend on coefficients that can be explicitly computed for models associated with discrete orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and conservation laws in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates promotes membrane-free compartmentalization in cells. The dynamics of these biocondensates is routinely regulated by energy-consuming processes. Here, we devise a theory pinpointing how active chemical reactions, interconverting molecules between phase-separating and inert forms, can drive faster condensate coarsening. We find that mass conservation limits droplet volume growth to being linear in time regardless of activity, resembling the passive Lifshitz-Slyozov law. However, if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts, e.g., as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</description>

      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Rise and fall of nonstabilizerness via random measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.</description>

      <title>Optimizing digital quantum simulation of open quantum lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.</description>
