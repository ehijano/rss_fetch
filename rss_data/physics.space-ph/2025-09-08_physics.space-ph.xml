      <title>Extremely diverse coronal jets accompanying an erupting filament captured by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar jets are collimated plasma ejections driven by magnetic reconnection, which play a critical role in the energy release and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Using Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) with its unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, we report the discovery of nine transient coronal jets associated with a filament eruption on September 30, 2024. These jets, with a median lifetime of only 22 seconds, have significantly shorter timescales than previously observed coronal jets. They exhibit diverse morphologies and properties, evolving through three distinct phases of the filament eruption: initiation, rise, and peak. The spatial and temporal distribution of the jets suggests they are driven by dynamic magnetic reconnection between the erupting filament and overlying magnetic fields. These jets represent a distinct class of phenomena different from traditional mini-filament-driven jets, being directly associated with large-scale filament eruption processes. This study reveals a previously unrecognised class of highly transient jets, highlighting the complexity of reconnection-driven processes during filament eruptions and underscoring the importance of high-resolution observations in uncovering fundamental plasma dynamics in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Solar Orbiter reveals persistent magnetic reconnection in medium-scale filament eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar filament eruptions play a key role in driving space weather, yet their fine-scale evolution remains poorly understood due to observational limitations. Using unprecedented high-resolution observations from Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (105 km/pixel) and Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager, we reveal persistent magnetic reconnection events in a failed filament eruption. We identify magnetic reconnections between the filament and surrounding magnetic field structures, with both frequency and type far exceeding previous observations. These reconnections significantly affect the filament stability and eruption dynamics, leading to sequential coronal jets and failed eruptions. We propose a 'persistent magnetic cutting' concept, highlighting how persistent small-scale magnetic reconnections cumulatively affect filament stability during its evolution.</description>
