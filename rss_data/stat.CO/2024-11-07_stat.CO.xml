      <title>A Surrogate Model for Quay Crane Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ports, a variety of tasks are carried out, and scheduling these tasks is crucial due to its significant impact on productivity, making the generation of precise plans essential. This study proposes a method to solve the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP), a representative task scheduling problem in ports known to be NP-Hard, more quickly and accurately. First, the study suggests a method to create more accurate work plans for Quay Cranes (QCs) by learning from actual port data to accurately predict the working speed of QCs. Next, a Surrogate Model is proposed by combining a Machine Learning (ML) model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is widely used to solve complex optimization problems, enabling faster and more precise exploration of solutions. Unlike methods that use fixed-dimensional chromosome encoding, the proposed methodology can provide solutions for encodings of various dimensions. To validate the performance of the newly proposed methodology, comparative experiments were conducted, demonstrating faster search speeds and improved fitness scores. The method proposed in this study can be applied not only to QCSP but also to various NP-Hard problems, and it opens up possibilities for the further development of advanced search algorithms by combining heuristic algorithms with ML models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Bipartite Networks in Anime Series: Textual Analysis, Topic Clustering, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article analyzes a specific bipartite network that shows the relationships between users and anime, examining how the descriptions of anime influence the formation of user communities. In particular, we introduce a new variable that quantifies the frequency with which words from a description appear in specific word clusters. These clusters are generated from a bigram analysis derived from all descriptions in the database. This approach fully characterizes the dynamics of these communities and shows how textual content affect the cohesion and structure of the social network among anime enthusiasts. Our findings suggest that there may be significant implications for the design of recommendation systems and the enhancement of user experience on anime platforms.</description>

      <title>SPINEX_ Symbolic Regression: Similarity-based Symbolic Regression with Explainable Neighbors Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new symbolic regression algorithm based on the SPINEX (Similarity-based Predictions with Explainable Neighbors Exploration) family. This new algorithm (SPINEX_SymbolicRegression) adopts a similarity-based approach to identifying high-merit expressions that satisfy accuracy- and structural similarity metrics. We conducted extensive benchmarking tests comparing SPINEX_SymbolicRegression to over 180 mathematical benchmarking functions from international problem sets that span randomly generated expressions and those based on real physical phenomena. Then, we evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, expression similarity in terms of presence operators and variables (as compared to the actual expressions), population size, and number of generations at convergence. The results indicate that SPINEX_SymbolicRegression consistently performs well and can, in some instances, outperform leading algorithms. In addition, the algorithm's explainability capabilities are highlighted through in-depth experiments.</description>

      <title>Extending Cluster-Weighted Factor Analyzers for multivariate prediction and high-dimensional interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster-weighted factor analyzers (CWFA) are a versatile class of mixture models designed to estimate the joint distribution of a random vector that includes a response variable along with a set of explanatory variables. They are particularly valuable in situations involving high dimensionality. This paper enhances CWFA models in two notable ways. First, it enables the prediction of multiple response variables while considering their potential interactions. Second, it identifies factors associated with disjoint groups of explanatory variables, thereby improving interpretability. This development leads to the introduction of the multivariate cluster-weighted disjoint factor analyzers (MCWDFA) model. An alternating expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is employed for parameter estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed through an extensive simulation study that examines various scenarios. The proposal is applied to crime data from the United States, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, with the aim of capturing potential latent heterogeneity within communities and identifying groups of socio-economic features that are similarly associated with factors predicting crime rates. Results provide valuable insights into the underlying structures influencing crime rates which may potentially be helpful for effective cluster-specific policymaking and social interventions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data-Driven Leverage Score Sampling Algorithm for the Minimum Volume Covering Ellipsoid Problem in Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Minimum Volume Covering Ellipsoid (MVCE) problem, characterised by $n$ observations in $d$ dimensions where $n \gg d$, can be computationally very expensive in the big data regime. We apply methods from randomised numerical linear algebra to develop a data-driven leverage score sampling algorithm for solving MVCE, and establish theoretical error bounds and a convergence guarantee. Assuming the leverage scores follow a power law decay, we show that the computational complexity of computing the approximation for MVCE is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(nd^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(nd + \text{poly}(d))$, which is a significant improvement in big data problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our new algorithm, showing that it substantially reduces computation time and yields near-optimal solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a scalable Bayesian estimation algorithm for sparse estimation in exploratory item factor analysis based on a classical Bayesian estimation method, namely Bayesian joint modal estimation (BJME). BJME estimates the model parameters and factor scores that maximize the complete-data joint posterior density. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm has high computational efficiency and accuracy in variable selection over latent factors and the recovery of the model parameters. Moreover, we conducted a real data analysis using large-scale data from a psychological assessment that targeted the Big Five personality traits. This result indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves computationally efficient parameter estimation and extracts the interpretable factor loading structure.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Annealed Importance Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from a multimodal distribution is a fundamental and challenging problem in computational science and statistics. Among various approaches proposed for this task, one popular method is Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based version of AIS by combining it with population-based Monte Carlo methods to improve its efficiency. By keeping track of an ensemble instead of a single particle along some continuation path between the starting distribution and the target distribution, we take advantage of the interaction within the ensemble to encourage the exploration of undiscovered modes. Specifically, our main idea is to utilize either the snooker algorithm or the genetic algorithm used in Evolutionary Monte Carlo. We discuss how the proposed algorithm can be implemented and derive a partial differential equation governing the evolution of the ensemble under the continuous time and mean-field limit. We also test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm on various continuous and discrete distributions.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Sparse Poisson Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have utilized the non-conjugate VB method for the problem of the sparse Poisson regression model. To provide an approximated conjugacy in the model, the likelihood is approximated by a quadratic function, which provides the conjugacy of the approximation component with the Gaussian prior to the regression coefficient. Three sparsity-enforcing priors are used for this problem. The proposed models are compared with each other and two frequentist sparse Poisson methods (LASSO and SCAD) to evaluate the estimation, prediction and the sparsing performance of the proposed methods. Throughout a simulated data example, the accuracy of the VB methods is computed compared to the corresponding benchmark MCMC methods. It can be observed that the proposed VB methods have provided a good approximation to the posterior distribution of the parameters, while the VB methods are much faster than the MCMC ones. Using several benchmark count response data sets, the prediction performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Consistent, multidimensional differential histogramming and summary statistics with YODA 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histogramming is often taken for granted, but the power and compactness of partially aggregated, multidimensional summary statistics, and their fundamental connection to differential and integral calculus make them formidable statistical objects, especially when very large data volumes are involved. But expressing these concepts robustly and efficiently in high-dimensional parameter spaces and for large data samples is a highly non-trivial challenge -- doubly so if the resulting library is to remain usable by scientists as opposed to software engineers. In this paper we summarise the core principles required for consistent generalised histogramming, and use them to motivate the design principles and implementation mechanics of the re-engineered YODA histogramming library, a key component of physics data-model comparison and statistical interpretation in collider physics.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Triple Interactions in Resting fMRI: Insights into Psychotic Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human brain dynamically integrated and configured information to adapt to the environment. To capture these changes over time, dynamic second-order functional connectivity was typically used to capture transient brain patterns. However, dynamic second-order functional connectivity typically ignored interactions beyond pairwise relationships. To address this limitation, we utilized dynamic triple interactions to investigate multiscale network interactions in the brain. In this study, we evaluated a resting-state fMRI dataset that included individuals with psychotic disorders (PD). We first estimated dynamic triple interactions using resting-state fMRI. After clustering, we estimated cohort-specific and cohort-common states for controls (CN), schizophrenia (SZ), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD). From the cohort-specific states, we observed significant triple interactions, particularly among visual, subcortical, and somatomotor networks, as well as temporal and higher cognitive networks in SZ. In SAD, key interactions involved temporal networks in the initial state and somatomotor networks in subsequent states. From the cohort-common states, we observed that high-cognitive networks were primarily involved in SZ and SAD compared to CN. Furthermore, the most significant differences between SZ and SAD also existed in high-cognitive networks. In summary, we studied PD using dynamic triple interaction, the first time such an approach has been used to study PD. Our findings highlighted the significant potential of dynamic high-order functional connectivity, paving the way for new avenues in the study of the healthy and disordered human brain.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Correlation Networks: High-Order Interactions in the Topology of Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand collective network behavior in the complex human brain, pairwise correlation networks alone are insufficient for capturing the high-order interactions that extend beyond pairwise interactions and play a crucial role in brain network dynamics. These interactions often reveal intricate relationships among multiple brain networks, significantly influencing cognitive processes. In this study, we explored the correlation of correlation networks and topological network analysis with resting-state fMRI to gain deeper insights into these higher-order interactions and their impact on the topology of brain networks, ultimately enhancing our understanding of brain function. We observed that the correlation of correlation networks highlighted network connections while preserving the topological structure of correlation networks. Our findings suggested that the correlation of correlation networks surpassed traditional correlation networks, showcasing considerable potential for applications in various areas of network science. Moreover, after applying topological network analysis to the correlation of correlation networks, we observed that some high-order interaction hubs predominantly occurred in primary and high-level cognitive areas, such as the visual and fronto-parietal regions. These high-order hubs played a crucial role in information integration within the human brain.</description>
