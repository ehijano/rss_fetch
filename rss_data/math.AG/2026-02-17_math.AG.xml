      <title>Restriction theorems: from orbits and Chevalley to periods and Galois</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a new approach based on Galois theory, we study subvarieties of complex representations of reductive groups which satisfy restriction properties on their invariant rings and function fields, along the lines of the Chevalley restriction theorem. For a certain well-behaved class of representations, we explicitly parametrize candidates for these restriction properties and explain a technique to understand their deformations in complex families. We also give algebraic and geometric characterizations of the Chevalley restriction property which clarify how this perspective connects back to previous orbit-theoretic approaches. Finally, we utilize these restriction properties to prove explicit formulas for period integrals of some Calabi-Yau families. The key insight is that the restriction property on function fields can be leveraged to locally interpolate between the algebraic and analytic settings. Using this technique, we lift hypergeometric period formulas from subfamilies to obtain novel explicit formulas for periods of Calabi-Yau double covers of projective spaces and elliptic curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$, expressed in terms of invariant functions on their parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>A surface with representable $\text{CH}_{0}$-group but no universal zero-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new obstruction to the existence of a universal $0$-cycle on a smooth projective complex variety. As an application, we construct a smooth projective complex surface whose Chow group of $0$-cycles is representable but which does not admit a universal $0$-cycle. This provides a two-dimensional analogue of Voisin's recent threefold counterexample to a question of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene. As a further consequence, we exhibit the first example of a smooth projective threefold of Kodaira dimension zero carrying a non-torsion Hodge class of degree $4$ that is not algebraic. The construction relies on the geometry of bielliptic surfaces of type 2.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Fano 3-folds from rational curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show exceptionality of certain families of non-quasismooth weighted hypersurfaces. In particular these admit K\"ahler-Einstein metrics. Our examples are produced by the monomials generating the complex deformations of orbifolds whose corresponding $S^1$-Seifert bundles are smooth rational homology 7-spheres admitting Sasaki-Einstein metrics. From our construction, it follows that these exceptional Fano hypersurfaces describe elements in the boundary of the K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any polynomial f with complex coefficients we find a remarkable subset of poles of the motivic zeta function. It is combinatorially determined by any log resolution and it admits an intrinsic interpretation in terms of contact loci of f. This uncovers a new, unexpected difficulty with proving the monodromy conjecture.</description>

      <title>Higher Direct Images of the Structure Sheaf Over a Dedekind Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for Noetherian, smooth, separated, integral, finite type schemes $X$ and $Y$ over an excellent Dedekind domain $R$, that are properly birational over $R$, we have $R^if_{*}\mathcal{O}_X \cong R^ig_{*} \mathcal{O}_Y$ and $R^i f_{*}\Omega_{X/S}^{d} \cong R^ig_{*} \Omega_{Y/S}^d$, where $d$ is the relative dimension of $X$ and $Y$ over $S= Spec(R)$, and $f$ and $g$ are the structure maps of $X$ and $Y$, respectively, as $S$-schemes. As a corollary we obtain the vanishing of higher direct images of the structure sheaf for proper birational morphisms beteween such schemes. These results extend those obtained by Chatzistamatiou--R\"ulling over perfect fields of positive characteristic and we obtain them by extending their method of algebraic correspondences. We furthermore obtain as a corollary that if $K$ is a number field and $\mathcal{O}_K$ its ring of integers and if $X$ is a smooth and proper $K$-scheme with $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ two smooth proper models of $X$ over some dense open subscheme $U \subseteq S = Spec(\mathcal{O}_K)$, that if $H^j(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}})$ is $\mathcal{O}_S(U)$-torsion-free we have $H^j(\mathcal{X}_t,\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}_t}) = H^j(\mathcal{Y}_t,\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Y}_t}),$ for all closed points $t \in U$.</description>

      <title>Double Artin-Schreier extensions of rational function fields with many lifted automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate algebraic function fields in positive characteristic mainly obtained as double Artin-Schreier extensions of rational function fields with a plane model. The goal is to extend to such extensions large automorphism groups of the rational function field. In this way, we construct some new families of ordinary function fields and determine their full automorphism groups. Such groups are large with respect to the genus, compared with the known upper bounds on the size of the automorphism group of an ordinary function field.</description>

      <title>Sections of Hodge bundles I: Global theory and applications to period maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study global sections of Hodge bundles arising from two complementary constructions: a deformation-theoretic construction, which yields global geometric consequences for period maps, and a construction from the matrix representation of the image of the period map, which provides an explicit Euclidean realization. Combining these perspectives, we prove that the image of the lifted period map on the universal cover is contained in a complex Euclidean subspace of the period domain, thereby giving a partial solution to a conjecture of Griffiths on the global behavior of period maps. As an application, we construct a global complex affine structure on the Teichm\"uller space of Calabi--Yau type manifolds.</description>

      <title>Sections of Hodge bundles II: deformation of $(p,p)$-classes and applications to K\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega_0)$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold and $\mathcal X\to B$ its Kuranishi family, where the base $B$ may be singular with $\dim_{\C} B \ge 1$. Using explicit sections of Hodge bundles obtained from algebraic and geometric constructions, we define an intrinsic period map and a Hodge map that parametrizes nearby $(p,p)$-classes.
  For deformations over irreducible analytic bases, we introduce $\nabla^{1,1}$-flat extensions of K\"ahler cones and obtain explicit positive representatives, leading to an upper semicontinuity property for these extensions. Combined with the characterization of K\"ahler cones due to Demailly--Paun, this yields a complete local description of K\"ahler cones in terms of analytic cycles. We further show that this upper semicontinuity persists on a large region of the base determined by a uniform bound on the operator norm of the Beltrami differential.
  As further applications, we generalize Green's density criterion to strong algebraic approximation and to the approximation of real $(p,p)$-forms, and give an intrinsic analytic description of Hodge loci, leading to a Beltrami-differential criterion for the variational Hodge conjecture.</description>

      <title>Categorical resolutions and birational geometry of nodal Gushel-Mukai varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordinary Gushel-Mukai variety with a single isolated node is the intersection of the Grassmannian $G(2,5)$ with a nodal quadric and a linear space. We consider such intersections in dimension three, four and five. We describe a flop between the blowup of such a variety and a quadric fibration over $\mathbb{P}^2$: at the level of derived categories, this flop establishes an equivalence between the categorical resolution of the Kuznetsov component of the Gushel--Mukai variety and the derived category of modules on the even part of the Clifford algebra of the quadric fibration. As a first application, we extend a result of Kuznetsov and Perry to the nodal case, and we describe a subfamily of rational, nodal Gushel--Mukai fourfolds whose Kuznetsov components admit a categorical resolution of singularities by an actual $K3$ surface of degree two without a Brauer twist. This produces evidence for a version of Kuznetsov's rationality conjecture. Then, we describe the relation with Verra threefolds and fourfolds at the categorical level. As a further application, we show that the categorical resolution of the Kuznetsov component of a 1-nodal Gushel-Mukai threefold determines its birational class.</description>

      <title>A Poisson--Poincar\'e--Dulac for Poisson Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Poisson-flat connections with logarithmic poles along a simple normal crossings divisor on a holomorphic Poisson manifold, where flatness is required only along the symplectic foliation. After identifying the relevant logarithmic cotangent Poisson Lie algebroid, we define an Euler--Poisson principal part and a residue theory adapted to the canonical logarithmic Hamiltonian generators. Under a precise nonresonance hypothesis, we establish a Poisson Poincar\'e--Dulac theorem: any logarithmic Poisson-flat connection with prescribed principal part is holomorphically gauge equivalent to a pure Euler--Poisson normal form with constant commuting residues, and this normal form is unique up to Casimir-valued gauge transformations lying in the common centralizer of the residues. To encode both leafwise transport and boundary winding, we construct a twisted leafwise fundamental groupoid via the real oriented blow-up and a 2-pushout that adjoins canonical tangential meridians. In the nonresonant regime, the normal form yields a meridional character determined by the residues, and hence a logarithmic Riemann--Hilbert correspondence in the Poisson setting for this groupoid. Finally, we illustrate the theory with rank-two Poisson modules (Poisson triples) and an explicit family of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a realisation theorem for irreducible hypergeometric local systems defined over the rational numbers in terms of families of affine varieties in algebraic tori. The families we consider have been studied extensively in the literature and appear in mirror symmetry. Our result holds unconditionally for families with one-dimensional or even-dimensional fibres. It holds under a monodromy assumption for families with fibres of odd dimension greater than one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field, $f:X\rightarrow S$ a proper morphism between connected schemes proper over $k$, $x\in X(k)$ lying over $s\in S(k)$, $X_s$ the fibre of $f$ over $s$, $\mathcal{C}_X$, $\mathcal{C}_{S}$, $\mathcal{C}_{X_s}$ Tannakian categories over $X,S,X_s$ respectively, $\pi(\mathcal{C}_X,x)$, $\pi(\mathcal{C}_S,s)$, $\pi(\mathcal{C}_{X_s},x)$ the Tannaka group schemes respectively. We give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the exactness of the homotopy sequence $\pi(\mathcal{C}_{X_s},x)\rightarrow \pi(\mathcal{C}_X,x)\rightarrow \pi(\mathcal{C}_S,s)\rightarrow 1$. In particular, we obtain the equivalent conditions for the Kunneth formula of fundamental group schemes for the product $X\times_k Y$ of two connected schemes $X$ and $Y$ proper over $k$. As an application, we obtain the Kunneth formula of certain fundamental group schemes over any field, such as S, Nori, EN, F, Etale, Loc, ELoc and Unipotent fundamental group schemes.</description>

      <title>Resolution Except for the Normal-Crossing Locus and Galois actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In characteristic zero we construct a canonical embedded and non-embedded resolution algorithm by weighted blow-ups that preserves the normal crossings (nc) locus and resolves singularities up to normal crossings. The process terminates with a Deligne-Mumford stack whose singularities are precisely normal crossings and are adapted to the exceptional divisor.
  The construction is governed by a rigidity property of canonical maximal admissible weighted centers together with a Galois-theoretic analysis of splitting forms. We show that normal crossings singularities are \'etale-locally simple normal crossings and can be viewed as quotients of simple normal crossings by finite Galois groups acting by permutation of branches. This viewpoint explains both the intrinsic role of weighted blow-ups and the natural emergence of stack structures in nc-preserving resolution.
  Building on the weighted blow-up framework of Abramovich-Temkin-W{\l}odarczyk and its logarithmic refinement developed in my previous work, we obtain in particular a canonical compactification of normal crossings Deligne-Mumford stacks and a functorial nc-preserving resolution for subvarieties and Deligne-Mumford stacks.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Brauer group of the moduli stack of parabolic stable principal $\text{PGL}(r,\mathbb{C})$-bundles on a curve $X$, for a generic system of weights along an arbitrary parabolic divisor, coincides with the Brauer group of the smooth locus of the corresponding coarse moduli space of parabolic stable principal $\text{PGL}(r,\mathbb{C})$-bundles. We also show that for any simple and simply connected complex linear algebraic group $G$, the analytic and algebraic Brauer groups of the moduli stack of quasi-parabolic principal $G$-bundles on $X$ vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve a previously known theoretic method to compute A-resultants for suitable monomial support sets due to Weyman to the extent that it becomes computationally feasible and effective. This is achieved by introducing a new algorithm for the computation of direct images of complexes of coherent sheaves on toric varieties. The procedure does not rely on Gr\"obner basis computations at any stage.</description>

      <title>Topological and arithmetic characteristics about products of projective lines with complex tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study non-planar degeneracies with cylindrical configurations. They could be constructed by the product $\mathbb{CP}^1 \times T$ of the projective plane and a complex torus with embedding $(m,n)$. We prove that their fundamental groups of Galois covers have an abelian subgroup of rank $m(2n-1)$ respectively, and the irregularity of these surfaces are at least $2mn-1$.

      <title>On the behavior of analytic torsion for twisted canonical bundles under degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a degeneration of projective algebraic manifolds equipped with a compact group action over a curve. Suppose that the total space carries a Nakano semi-positive vector bundle, which is equivariant with respect to this action. We consider the relative canonical bundle twisted by this bundle. Under this setting, we prove that the logarithm of the equivariant analytic torsion of the regular fibers for this coefficient admits an asymptotic expansion near the discriminant locus. The leading term is given by a logarithmic singularity, while the subdominant term is given by a loglog-type singularity. In the non-equivariant case, we provide a formula for the coefficient of the leading term in terms of an integral of characteristic classes associated with the semi-stable reduction of the family. To establish these results, we prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion for both the equivariant Quillen metrics and the $L^{2}$-metrics in the above setting. We also calculate the leading term of the fiber integral of the Bott-Chern classes associated with the degeneration.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau complete intersections associated to good pairs of generalized nef partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of good pair of generalized nef partitions to describe Calabi-Yau complete intersections in Q-Fano toric varieties whose equations do not necessarily have maximal Newton polytopes. Moreover, we define a natural duality between them which generalizes Batyrev-Borisov mirror duality and allows to define a generalization of Berglund-H\"ubsch-Krawitz duality to quasismooth complete intersections.</description>

      <title>A few remarks on sections of the Picard bundle of family of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sections of the relative Picard bundle of a family of curves of genus $g \geq 2$ through the rank of the associated normal function. Using Griffiths' formula for the infinitesimal invariant and higher Schiffer variations, we establish a numerical inequality relating the rank, the minimal support of a representing divisor and the modular dimension of the family. When the modular map is dominant, we obtain a sharp classification: equality occurs only for multiples of odd theta characteristics or of the canonical section. As applications, we derive geometric consequences for plane curves, obtaining results on intersections with very general quartic curves, in the spirit of the work of Chen-Riedl-Yeong, and with quintic curves.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Hausel-Hitchin, we investigate core Lagrangians and upward flows in Hilbert schemes of points on elliptic surfaces. We compute the scheme-theoretic multiplicities of core Lagrangians, as well as the equivariant multiplicities of the very stable ones. Furthermore, we extend the notion of equivariant multiplicity to wobbly components and compute it for Hilbert schemes of two points. Inspired by Eisenstein series functor in Dolbeault Langlands correspondence, we propose that upward flows of very stable ideals are mirror dual to modified Procesi bundles, and justify this claim through numerical checks. Finally, we make some conjectures about extending this picture to wobbly upward flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper undertakes the study of the topology of T-manifolds of arbitrary codimension obtained by combinatorial patchworking with real phase structure as described by Brugall\'e, L\'opez de Medrano and Rau (2024). We prove new bounds on the number of connected components of T-curves and T-surfaces. For sufficiently high codimension, this improves the results of Brugall\'e, L\'opez de Medrano and Rau (2024).
  In addition, we present a new description of patchworking \`a la Viro for T-manifold of codimension 2. We use this method to construct a family of maximal real algebraic curves in $\mathbb RP^3$.</description>

      <title>The projective coinvariant algebra, Young invariants and bigraded coordinate rings of Segre embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a flat degeneration P_n of the classical coinvariant algebra R_n, a bigraded Artinian Gorenstein algebra that arises from the coordinate ring of the Segre embedding of the n-fold self-product of the projective line. The Frobenius character of P_n is computed by a natural bigraded refinement of the classical Lusztig--Stanley formula for the character of the coinvariant algebra. Young invariants in P_n get related to coordinate rings of general Segre embeddings of products of projective spaces; their bigraded Hilbert polynomials get expressed in terms of major-descent generating functions of words in multisets. Relations to the diagonal coinvariant algebra, cohomological interpretations including quantum cohomology, and Garsia-Stanton-style bases are also explored.</description>

      <title>Constructing genus 2 curves with given refined Humbert invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1994, Kani introduced an algebraic version of the Humbert invariant, known as the refined Humbert invariant. This invariant q_C is a positive definite quadratic form attached to a smooth curve C of genus 2. It serves as a vital tool, as many geometric properties of C are reflected in the arithmetic properties of q_C. When the Jacobian J_C of a genus 2 curve C is isogenous to a product of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, the forms q_C have been completely classified recently. In this paper, building upon this classification, we present a constructive algorithm that produces J_C and a divisorial representative of a curve C of genus 2 such that its refined Humbert invariant q_C is equivalent to a given integral ternary quadratic form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of almost complex structures on even-dimensional sphere bundles over complex projective spaces. For bundles $\xi_{n,q}$ with fibre $S^{2q}$ over $\mathbb{C} P^n$, we establish a necessary condition: if $q \ge a(n)$ for an explicit function, then the total space $E_{n,q}$ does not admit an almost complex structure. As an application, we analyse a concrete family associated with the canonical line bundle and obtain non-existence criteria in terms of $p$-adic valuations; for $p=2$ this yields a simple numerical bound. The proofs rely on Chern class computations and divisibility properties of characteristic classes. The results leave open the question of existence in the range $4 \le q &lt; a(n)$.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature of periodic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05652v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p&gt;0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</description>

      <title>The effective cone conjecture for Calabi--Yau pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate an effective cone conjecture for klt Calabi--Yau pairs $(X,\Delta)$, pertaining to the structure of the cone of effective divisors $\mathrm{Eff}(X)$ modulo the action of the subgroup of pseudo-automorphisms $\mathrm{PsAut}(X,\Delta)$. Assuming the existence of good minimal models in dimension $\dim(X)$, known to hold in dimension up to $3$, we prove that the effective cone conjecture for $(X,\Delta)$ is equivalent to the Kawamata--Morrison--Totaro movable cone conjecture for $(X,\Delta)$, among other statements. As an application, we show that the movable cone conjecture unconditionally holds for the smooth Calabi--Yau threefolds introduced by Schoen and studied by Namikawa, Grassi and Morrison. We also show that for such a Calabi--Yau threefold $X$, all of its minimal models, apart from $X$ itself, have rational polyhedral nef cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article generalizes the theory of shifted symplectic structures to the relative context and non-geometric stacks. We describe basic constructions that naturally appear in this theory: shifted cotangent bundles and the AKSZ procedure. Along the way, we also develop the theory of shifted symplectic groupoids presenting shifted symplectic structures on quotients and define a deformation to the normal cone for shifted Lagrangian morphisms.</description>

      <title>Brill-Noether loci of pencils with prescribed ramification on moduli of curves and on Severi varieties on $K3$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the assumption that the adjusted Brill-Noether number $\widetilde{\rho}$ is at least $-g$, we prove that the Brill-Noether loci in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ of pointed curves carrying pencils with prescribed ramification at the marked points have a component of the expected codimension with pointed curves having Brill-Noether varieties of pencils of the minimal dimension. As an application, the map from the Hurwitz scheme to $\mathcal{M}_g$ is dominant if $n+\widetilde{\rho} \geq 0$ and generically finite otherwise, settling a variation of a classical problem of Zariski.
  In the second part of the paper, we study the analogous loci of curves in Severi varieties on $K3$ surfaces, proving existence of curves with non-general behaviour from the point of view of Brill-Noether theory. This extends previous results of Ciliberto and the first named author to the ramified case. We apply these results to study correspondences and cycles on $K3$ surfaces in relation to Beauville-Voisin points and constant cycle curves.</description>

Abstract: In the space of square matrices, we characterize row-generated subspaces, on which the determinant is an irreducible polynomial. As a corollary, we characterize square systems of polynomial equations with indeterminate coefficients, whose discriminant is an irreducible hypersurface. This resolves a conjecture of Esterov, and, in a sequel paper, leads to a complete description of components and codimensions for discriminants of square systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Components of discriminants for systems of equations and irreducibility of determinants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discriminant of a multivariate polynomial with indeterminate coefficients is not necessarily a hypersurface, and characterizing its codimension was an open problem for quite a while. We resolve this problem for the discriminants of systems of polynomials with indeterminate coefficients and with the same number of equations and unknowns (square polynomial systems). This version is more involved in the sense that the discriminant may have several components of different dimensions.
  In the space of square matrices, we characterize row-generated subspaces on which the determinant is an irreducible polynomial. This allows us to resolve the Esterov conjecture for square polynomial systems whose discriminant is an irreducible hypersurface. Based on this result, we enumerate all the components and determine their dimensions and degrees for each of the three conventional ways to formalize the notion of a discriminant in this setting (mixed, Cayley, and A-discriminants) in cases of square and overdetermined systems. The proof of Esterov's conjecture and descriptions of the three types of discriminants are based on the theory of polymatroids.</description>

Abstract: We study Chow groups and \'etale motivic cohomology groups of smooth complete intersections with Hodge structures of level one, classified by Deligne and Rapoport, with particular attention to fivefolds. We extend these results to an \'etale motivic context and recover an analogous finite-dimensionality in the sense of Kimura. We further analyse algebraic cycles on other smooth Fano manifolds with Hodge structures of level one and, as an application, we prove the integral Hodge conjecture for smooth quartic double fivefolds by means of the \'etale motivic approach.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

      <description>arXiv:2512.23479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algebraic monodromy of families of cyclic Galois coverings of curves. Under a condition on the $G$-decomposition of the associated variation of Hodge structures, we prove a criterion for the maximality of the monodromy. The proof combines the genus-zero case with a degeneration argument involving Prym varieties of certain admissible coverings. As a consequence of our criterion, we show that for $g\geq 8$ there exists no special family of Galois covers of the type we consider, providing new evidence towards the Coleman-Oort conjecture. Finally, we determine when the loci of double and triple Galois covers are totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>A proof of Dolbeault geometric Langlands for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ with reduced spectral curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper with Tudor P\u{a}durariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence.
  In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence.
  Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</description>

Abstract: In this survey, we give an overview of advances in the theory and computation of sparse resultants. First, we examine the construction and proof of the Canny-Emiris formula, which gives a rational determinantal formula. Second, we discuss and compare the latter with the computation of the sparse resultant as the determinant of the Koszul complex given by $n + 1$ nef divisors in a toric variety. Finally, we cover techniques for computing the Newton polytope of sparse resultants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the exact counting of all elliptic curves over $K = \mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with $\mathrm{char}(K) &gt; 3$ by Bejleri, Satriano and the author, together with the torsion-free nature of most elliptic curves over global function fields proven by Phillips, and the overarching conjecture of Goldfeld and Katz-Sarnak regarding the ``Distribution of Ranks of Elliptic Curves''. Consequently, we arrive at the quantitative statement which naturally renders even finer conjecture regarding the lower order main terms differing for the number of $E/K$ with $|E(K)| = 1$ and $E(K) = \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to obtain upper bounds for the regularity of graded deficiency modules in the spirit of the one obtained by Kumini--Murai in the monomial case building upon the spectral sequence formalism developed by \`Alvarez Montaner, Boix and Zarzuela. This spectral sequence formalism allows us not only to recover Kumini--Murai's upper bound for monomial ideals, but also to extend it for other types of rings, which include toric face rings and some binomial edge rings, producing to the best of our knowledge new upper bounds for the regularity of graded deficiency modules of this type of rings.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We give several applications of this procedure, which produced results concerning embeddings of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s, or embeddings of lens spaces as a hypersurface of contact type, in small rational surfaces such as $CP^2\#\overline{CP^2}$ and $S^2\times S^2$, as well as results on the uniqueness or classification of certain symplectic fillings by a $Q$-homology $4$-ball. Further work on the classification of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s is suggested. Moreover, our investigation on the $S^1$-invariant contact structures suggests an interesting and fairly strong upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair $(p,q)$ in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the values $p,q$), and for the symplectic version, we prove the existence of an ``optimal" symplectic rational unicuspidal curve in a rational $4$-manifold which realizes the upper bound for any given Puiseux pair $(p,q)$. Our results also suggest a revisit of the ``symplectic divisorial capping" problem first considered by Li and Mak. Further applications of the techniques developed in this paper hinge upon better understandings for the tightness and fillability criterions of $S^1$-invariant contact structures as well as their (small) symplectic fillings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the picture deformation technique of De Jong-Van Straten we show that no singularity whose resolution graph has 3 or 4 large nodes, i.e., nodes satisfying d(v)+e(v)\leq -2, has a QHD smoothing. This is achieved by providing a general reduction algorithm for graphs with QHD smoothings, and enumeration. New examples and families are presented, which admit a combinatorial QHD smoothing, i.e. the incidence relations for a sandwich presentation can be satisfied. We also give a new proof of the Bhupal-Stipsicz theorem on the classification of weighted homogeneous singularities admitting QHD smoothings with this method by using cusp singularities.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Rational Blowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rational blowdown operation in 4-manifold topology replaces a neighborhood of a configuration of spheres by a rational homology ball. Such configurations typically arise from resolutions of surface singularities that admit rational homology disk smoothings. Conjecturally, all such singularities must be weighted homogeneous and belong to certain specific families: Stipsicz-Szab\'o--Wahl constructed QHD smoothings for these families and used Donaldson's theorem to obtain very restrictive necessary conditions on the resolution graphs for singularities with this property. In particular, these results, as well as subsequent work of Bhupal-Stipsicz, show that for certain resolution graphs, the canonical contact structure on the link of the singularity cannot admit a QHD symplectic filling. By contrast, we exhibit Stein rational homology disk fillings for the contact links of an infinite family of rational singularities that are {\em not} weighted homogeneous, producing a new symplectic rational blowdown. Inspiration for our construction comes from de Jong-van Straten's description of Milnor fibers of sandwiched singularities; we use the symplectic analog of de Jong-van Straten theory developed by the second and third authors. The unexpected Stein fillings are built using spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study graded perfectoid rings as graded analogues of Scholze's (integral) perfectoid rings. We establish a categorical equivalence between graded perfectoid rings and graded perfect prisms, extending the Bhatt-Scholze's correspondence to the graded setting. We also construct the initial graded perfectoid cover of any graded semiperfectoid rings and prove a graded version of Andr\'e's flatness lemma. These results lay the foundations for a graded theory of perfectoid rings.</description>

      <title>On the Bergman Kernel of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an exact formula for the Bergman kernel function of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. The formula involves summation over all geodesic loops based at a point, which has a striking analogy with the Selberg trace formula. As an application, we prove a result about the maximum and minimum of the Bergman kernel function. We also prove an estimate of the off-diagonal Bergman kernel.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalences for chain complexes with support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Serre subcategory $\mathscr L$ and a resolving subcategory $\mathscr A$ of an abelian category, we show that the derived equivalence $D^b(\overline{\mathscr A} \cap \mathscr L) \simeq D^b_{\mathscr L}(\mathscr A)$ holds under certain conditions. We apply this to obtain derived equivalences in the contexts of chain complexes of graded modules or coherent sheaves, with finite $\mathscr A$-dimension, supported on closed sets having eventually finite $\mathscr A$-dimension. Using this, we obtain descriptions of the homotopy fibers in (hermitian) K theory of the restriction maps to certain open sets.</description>
