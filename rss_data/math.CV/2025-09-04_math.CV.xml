      <title>Bruck conjecture for solutions of first-order partial differential equations in Cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider Br\"{u}ck conjecture as the solutions of first-order partial differential equations in several complex variables. Our results ensure that Br\"{u}ck conjecture in $\mathbb{C}^m$ is valid under some additional conditions. In pursuit of this goal, we have also established the Borel-Caratheodory theorem in $\mathbb{C}^m$ and derived several fundamental results concerning order and hyper-order into higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Parabolic dynamics according to Maurice Heins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, based upon an unpublished manuscript by Maurice Heins, answers a question posed by Valiron about the dynamics of parabolic self-maps of the unit disk in the complex plane, considerably simplifying arguments previously used for answering the same question. The main new tool introduced is the notion of left straightening of a sequence of iterates, that can be effectively employed for studying the hyperbolic step of a parabolic map.</description>

      <title>Metric version of the Zariski Multiplicity Conjecture is true for multiplicity two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if two algebraic $(n-1)$-dimensional cones $P, R\subset\mathbb C^n$ are ambient homeomorphic, then their bases $B_P$ and $B_R$ have the same Euler characteristic. As an application, we show our main result: if $(X,0),(Y,0)\subset (\C^n,0)$ are germs of analytic hypersurfaces, which are ambient bi-Lipschitz equivalent and $m_0(X)=2$, then also $m_0(Y)=2.$. As another application, we also obtain a complete positive answer to the Metric Arnold-Vassiliev Problem, which says that if two holomorphic functions have zeros that are ambient bi-Lipschitz invariant, then the Hessian matrices of the functions have the same rank.</description>

      <title>On contact Hamiltonian functions of singular contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13613v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For contact manifolds, it is well-known that the map which assigns to an infinitesimal contact transformation its contact Hamiltonian function is a linear isomorphism, and an explicit local formula for its inverse can be given. In contrast, infinitesimal contact transformations on a singular contact structure have not been well-studied yet. In this article, we show that this map is injective and present an explicit local formula for its inverse when the contact structure has singularities of the first type with structurally smooth Martinet hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Sigma function associated with a hyperelliptic curve with two points at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baker constructed basic meromorphic functions on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve with two points at infinity. We call them Baker functions. The construction is based on the Abel-Jacobi map, which allows us to identify the field of meromorphic functions on the Jacobian variety of the curve with the field of meromorphic functions on the symmetric product of the curve. In our previous paper, a solution to the KP equation was constructed in terms of the Baker function. This paper is devoted to the properties of the Baker functions. In this paper, we construct an entire function whose second logarithmic derivatives are the Baker functions. We prove that the power series expansion of the entire function around the origin is determined only by the coefficients of the defining equation of the curve and a branch point of the curve algebraically. We also describe the quasi-periodicity of the entire function and express the entire function in terms of the Riemann theta function.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Higher-Order Vekua Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend representation formulas for functions in Hardy classes of solutions to higher-order iterated Vekua equations to Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions that solve a bicomplex version of the Vekua equation or its higher-order generalizations. Using these representations, we show that functions in these bicomplex-valued Hardy classes have nontangential boundary values and boundary values in the sense of distributions.</description>

      <title>On The Geometry and Topology of Cayley Condition in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties of the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus of pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the algebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the geometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex manifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic variety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of non-degenerate conics.
  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of transversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of $\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.
  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this space of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset of the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which corresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values $0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber bundle over $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1728\}$. This structure allows for the computation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.
  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet correspondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.</description>

      <title>Deformations of geometric structures on a subclass of LVM threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of geometric structures on some LVM manifolds of complex dimension $3$. More precisely, we study resonant structures, a particular type of $(G,X)$-structures, via the Ehresmann-Thurston principle, and their link with the deformation of the complex structure of the LVM manifold in the sense of Kodaira, Spencer and Kuranishi. We describe the Kuranishi family of these manifolds and construct a family containing all of them and complete at every point.</description>

      <title>Toric geometry of generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a local equivalence between toric steady K\"ahler-Ricci solitons and $A$-type toric generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons (GKRS). Under natural global conditions we show this equivalence extends to complete GKRS, yielding a general construction of new examples in all dimensions. We show that in four dimensions, all GKRS are either described by the generalized K\"ahler Gibbons-Hawking ansatz, or have split tangent bundle, or are $A$-type toric. This yields a local classification in four dimensions, together with a conjecturally exhaustive construction of complete symplectic-type examples.</description>
