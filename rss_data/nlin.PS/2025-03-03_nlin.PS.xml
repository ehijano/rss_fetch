      <title>Non-Local Elastic Lattices with $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetry and Time Modulation: From Perfect Trapping to the Wave Boomerang Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave motion is fundamentally constrained by the dispersion properties of the medium, often making it challenging -- or even impossible -- to guide wave packets along desired trajectories, particularly when wave inversion is required. The paper illustrates how one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian elastic lattices with time-varying non-local feedback interactions offer unprecedented wave guidance. By relaxing the constraint of Hermiticity while preserving $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of the nonlocal interactions, it is herein built a framework where the dispersion transitions from positive to negative group velocity, passing through an intermediate regime characterized by a perfectly flat band across all momenta. This effect, realized within the unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase, is further enhanced by the time modulation of lattice parameters, thereby unlocking functionalities such as perfect trapping, where a wave packet is intentionally stopped, and the wave boomerang effect, where the wave packet is reversed or guided back to its initial position. The framework presented in this paper unlocks opportunities that extend beyond wave guidance, including information processing through dispersion engineering in elastic media.</description>

      <title>On the role of 5-wave resonances in the nonlinear dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the $(\alpha+\beta)$ Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice (FPUT lattice, for short) for an arbitrary number $N$ of interacting particles, in regimes of small enough nonlinearity so that a Birkhoff-Gustavson type of normal form can be found using tools from wave-turbulence theory. Specifically, we obtain the so-called Zakharov equation for $4$-wave resonant interactions and its extension to $5$-wave resonant interactions by Krasitskii, but we introduce an important new feature: even the generic terms in these normal forms contain $resonant$ $interactions$ $only$, via a $unique$ canonical transformation. The resulting normal forms provide an approximation to the original FPUT lattice that possesses a significant number of exact quadratic conservation laws, beyond the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. We call the new equations "exact-resonance evolution equations" and examine their properties: (i) Heisenberg representation's slow evolution allows us to implement numerical methods with large time steps to obtain relevant dynamical information, such as Lyapunov exponents. (ii) We introduce tests, such as convergence of the normal form transformation and truncation error verification, to successfully validate our exact-resonance evolution equations. (iii) The systematic construction of new quadratic invariants (via the resonant cluster matrix) allows us to use finite-time Lyapunov exponent calculations to quantify the level of nonlinearity at which the original FPUT lattice is well approximated by the exact-resonance evolution equations. We show numerical experiments in the case $N=9$, but the theory and numerical methods are valid for arbitrary values of $N$. We conclude that, when $3$ divides $N$, at small enough nonlinearity the FPUT lattice's dynamics and nontrivial hyperchaos are governed by $5$-wave resonant interactions.</description>

      <title>Bistability of travelling waves and wave-pinning states in a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system: From bifurcations to implications for actin waves</title>

Abstract: Eukaryotic cells demonstrate a wide variety of dynamic patterns of filamentous actin (F-actin) and its regulators. Some of these patterns play important roles in cell functions, such as distinct motility modes, which motivate this study. We devise a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model for active and inactive Rho-GTPase and F-actin in the cell cortex. The mass-conserved Rho-GTPase system promotes F-actin, which feeds back to inactivate the former. We study the model on a 1D periodic domain (edge of thin sheet-like cell) using bifurcation theory in the framework of spatial dynamics, complemented with numerical simulations. Among several discussed bifurcations, the analysis centers on the unfolding of the codimension-2 long wavelength and finite wavenumber Hopf instability, in which we describe a rich structure of steady wave-pinning states (a.k.a.\ mesas, obeying the Maxwell construction), propagating coherent solutions (fronts and excitable pulses), and travelling and standing waves, all distinguished by mass conservation regimes and classified by domain sizes. Specifically, we highlight the unexpected conditions for bistability between steady wave-pinning and travelling wave states on moderate domain sizes. These results uncover and exemplify possible mechanisms of coexistence, robustness, and transitions between distinct cellular motility modes, including directed migration, turning, and ruffling. More broadly, the results indicate that dissipative reaction-diffusion models comprising mass conservation have distinct pattern formation mechanisms that motivate further investigations, such as the unfolding of codimension-3 instabilities and T-points.</description>

      <title>TRENDy: Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics pervade the natural sciences, from the morphogen dynamics underlying patterning in animal pigmentation to the protein waves controlling cell division. A central challenge lies in understanding how controllable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior called bifurcations. This endeavor is particularly difficult in realistic settings where governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown and data is limited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy (Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-free approach to learning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics. TRENDy first maps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics through a cascade of multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the recognition that these effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE. The preceding filtering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the NODE, making TRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing methods. We train TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and real data representing dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We then demonstrate how we can automatically locate both Turing and Hopf bifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our method to the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard through development. We found that TRENDy's predicted effective state not only accurately predicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct pattern features unique to different anatomical regions, such as the tail, neck, and body--an insight that highlights the potential influence of surface geometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their role in driving spatially varying pattern dynamics.</description>
